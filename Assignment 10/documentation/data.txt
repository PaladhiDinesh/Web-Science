My task here is to find out the nearest neighbors for ``http://f-measure.blogspot.com/'' and ``http://ws-dl.blogspot.com/'' blogs.
In order to find this I took blogdata matrix from my assignment 8 and processed it using the code in listing\ref{lst:q1-1}. Sample blogdata matrix can be found in fig\ref{Sample1}.
This code creates a vector for each blog which can be given as input to the my next code in listing\ref{lst:q1-2}.
I have taken this code from ``Programming Collective Intelligence'' textbook and made modifications to it.
I have deleted Euclidean function and inserted cosine function as distance metric. So, this is used to find the cosine between vectors of 500 dimensions.
Knnestimate() function is to find the neighbors for a particular blog which takes input as k=1 or 2 or 5 or 10 or 20.
Each time we give a k value it gives the respective k number of neighbors for that particular blog.
The nearest neighbors for ``F-Measure'' blog can be found in fig\ref{Sample2}.
The nearest neighbors for ``Web Science and Digital Libraries Research Group'' blog can be found in fig\ref{Sample3}.

For this question I need to get data from my Assignment 2.
I have taken the code from the assignment 2 and executed it again which gives me a complete different set of TimeMaps. So, Now I have old and new TimeMaps which should be used to get solution for this question.
Python code for getting the new TimeMaps can be found in listing\ref{lst:q2-1}.
The input I gave to the above code can be found in fig\ref{Sampleti1}.
So, Now I subtracted the old TimeMaps from the New TimeMaps which gives me the difference between both of them.
This difference in the TimeMaps is then plotted using the following R code which can be seen in listing\ref{lst:q2-2}.
The plotted graph can be seen in the fig\ref{Samplet1}.
So by this we can know that there have been positive increase and negative increase from new and old TimeMaps data.

In this question I need to compare the resulting text from my 3rd Assignment and present resulting text.
In order to do this I have taken code from 3rd Assignment and executed it again and the code for this can be seen in the following listing\ref{lst:q4-1}.
This gives me a new set of raw and processed data files with complete updated text. Now I need to find the difference in the file sizes in bytes for each URI.
In order to subtract the old file sizes from the new file sizes I wrote a code for it which can be seen in the listing\ref{lst:q4-2}. 
This was a tough task because I need to do it for new raw and processed data and old raw and processed data which is very confusing as the data files are pretty similar.
I also checked for the status codes of all the URI's using the code in listing\ref{lst:q4-3}. I have found out that there are 891 URI's which give a status code of ``200''.
The list of other status codes can be seen in the table below.
I have then plotted a line graph using R which shows the differences in bytes for the files in old and new data. This code for this can be found in the listing\ref{lst:q4-4}.
Line graph showing the differences for the files sizes in bytes for raw data can be found in the fig\ref{Samplet41}.
Line graph showing the differences for the files sizes in bytes for processed data can be found in the fig\ref{Samplet42}.
Then my last task is to take a list of all URI's which return status code as ``200'' and from that list I need to pick top 3 most changed data files. This is done only for processed data files.
The top 3 URI's whose resulting text are mostly changed are ``http://www.gaynycdad.com/2016/02/giveaway-25-walmartsams-club-gift-card.html',``http://peanutbutterandwhine.com/februarys-50-your-way-giveaway-single-blog/'' and ``http://newsbunch.com/tech-news/track-cell-service-along-your-subway-route-with-this-new-app/''.
The changes for these particular URI's are compared using ``vim -d newdatafile olddatafile''.
When the above code in executed in putty it gives me the changes that occured in their text which are shown below.
The changes in the text files for 1st top most changed URI can be seen in the fig\ref{Sample43}.
The changes in the text files for 2nd top most changed URI can be seen in the fig\ref{Sample44}.
The changes in the text files for 3rd top most changed URI can be seen in the fig\ref{Sample45}.
