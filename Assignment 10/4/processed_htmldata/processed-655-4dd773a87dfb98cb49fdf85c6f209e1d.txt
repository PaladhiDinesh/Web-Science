[18]The Classiest Debate Moment That No-One Noticed – Never Leave A Good
Man Down…

   Posted on [19]February 7, 2016 by [20]sundance

   Few people will talk about this, and fewer will even want to
   acknowledge it, but what Donald Trump did before the debate even began
   shows the measure of a real man’s worth.

   Trump and Carson

   At the beginning of the ABC debate, each of the candidates were being
   introduced in a specific order.  The first name called to the stage was
   Chris Christie.  The applause was loud and lingered through the time
   when Martha Raddatz called the second candidate Ben Carson.

   Dr. Carson did not hear his name called (easy to understand why when
   you listen to the video) and stood in the entry-way.  The moderators,
   with their backs to the candidates, didn’t notice his absence and
   called the third name on the list, Ted Cruz.

   Ted walked past Dr. Carson and onto the stage.  Carson remained in the
   awkward, and embarrassing position, ‘no-mans-land’, on-camera but out
   of sight of the live audience.

   What happened next shows the remarkable character of Donald Trump.

   The fourth name called was Donald Trump, but by then the back-stage
   crew and candidates were aware of Dr. Carsons’ position.  Trump slowly
   approached, and then realized the embarrassing position of a fellow
   candidate hanging in the wind.

   Trump showed his leadership by standing right next to his friend, and
   not walking onto the stage.

   The other names continued to be called, and proceeded as mentioned.
   But not Donald Trump, he remained with his colleague thereby reducing
   the internal anxiety felt by Carson.

   It would have been very easy for Trump to walk by Ben, just like all
   the other candidates did.  But instead he chose to wait, and remove the
   embarrassment factor by infinite magnitudes.

   Then, like a boss, when Dr. Carson was called to the stage, Trump
   waited and allowed Ben to get the audience response and appreciation.
   It takes a lot of courage to make split second decisions like this, and
   it shows a remarkable insight into the man’s character.

   Watch.

   People often mistake Donald Trump’s self-confidence for arrogance or
   even narcissism. But there is not a narcissist on the planet who would
   have put themselves into a position like that to assist a competing
   colleague.

   Here’s Mr. Trump talking to an audience member several years ago, and
   reminding them that no-one is “less than”.

       I love the Donald but you guys are giving credit where it’s not
       deserved cause thats not what happened.
       The Donald walked out cause the instructor behind the curtain told
       him to but did not proceed to go out on stage cause like Dr Carson
       he did not hear his name called. Lol. Yes Trump is a class act but
       that had nothing to do with comforting Ben Carson. Lol

            When it comes to character traits, everybody seemed to be an
            expert of someone else’s. I would say…you need to know thyself
            first before open your mouth and remove all doubt.

                 Fact remains–Trump did not pass Carson, as all the rest
                 did…knowing the problem as they all did…with no doubt.
                 Actions speak, and pictures are worth a billion words…

                      I watched it too! What I saw and noted to my
                      friends, that Donald waited with Dr. Carson until
                      Carson was called and he put his arm around him
                      jokingly! Was very caring to Dr. Ben.. Trump is a
                      winner all around!

            Trump additionally went as far as to allow Carson to have his
            moment of introduction even when the moderators tried to get
            them to both come out after the gaffe. He waited like a true
            gentleman. Asi you are mistaken. Watch again.

                 No, if you actually listen, it’s just that the moderators
                 were terrible at their job, and didn’t wait for applause
                 to die down like they are supposed to.
                 When Trump waited the first time, he couldn’t hear his
                 name called because everyone was cheering.
                 When Trump waited the second time, it’s because they
                 casually said “And Donald Trump” while everyone was
                 cheering for Carson.
                 Kasich was also called up once and didn’t hear his name
                 through the cheering. Rubio couldn’t even hear it through
                 the crowd, as he kept saying “What about Kasich? Can I
                 introduce Kasich?”
                 You’re definitely giving credit where credit isn’t due.

            I watched this vid several times, and was debating whether
            Trump heard his name called too. HOwever, it seems to me that
            the backstage guy was telling Carson to go forward and he
            didn’t and Trump was aware of what was going on backstage–that
            Carson was left behind…so Trump came out not ready to go yet
            and stuck around with Carson. I only wish we culd hear what
            Trump was telling Carson to be sure, but he is a class act. I
            think ppl GROSSLY underestimate the people skills that are
            REQU IRED to be the consummate biz man Trump is. That’s why
            many admire him and think of him almost as a mentor like a Big
            Papa, lol.

       personality to a glittering diamond. He can’t be bought and is
       familiar with so many methods of bringing back to life a flagging

       compassion and good manners excel when requred. He is a man of his
       word . He is a straight shooter with no B.S. in his vocabulary. He
       shows strength in ever phase . Keep up the good work Mr. Trump The
       world needs a Strong Leader at that is you.. :-)

            ..guess everyone has forgotten how he smacked down Meg Kelly
            and made fun of Carly Fiorina looks. How he calls some women
            “pigs” and those who do not agree with him “stupid” – Morons
            or worse. THAT IS GOOD MANNERS? This country is so fickle
            minded as well as short memory. Yes he is a straight shooter
            full of BS, a bully with big time “mommy issues”. A
            billionaire did not get that way by being the choir boy people
            are fawning about. Additionally, there seems to be quite a
            difference in what supposedly happened regarding his “manners”
            and Ben Carson. Big legends are started with less.

                 however, I think the reporter that “snitched” on Donald
                 for the Carly face comment was wrong for reporting that.
                 It likely was just “guy talk” and nothing serious.

       I believe “Sure” was just pointing out that sometimes things aren’t
       what they seem. You assume that Mr. Cruz knew exactly what was
       going on with Mr. Carson in that hallway and you choose to judge
       him and call him a name, based on that assumption. I assume that
       “Sure” wasn’t judging you, but was simply pointing out that by
       using the language you were, someone could assume you weren’t the
       best Christian. I’m not judging you, and I doubt Sure was judging
       you. As I assume we all know, Jesus is the only true judge and he
       is just. None of us are perfect so it is good that he is also
       gracious and forgiving. Mr. Trump is a dynamic mover and shaker
       with many qualities that most true US citizens like, but he is not
       the most biblically focused candidate. As Christians, we should be
       searching for and backing the candidate that best presents those
       values.

            God..Not everyone carries their religion on their sleeves for
            all to see. Trump puts God, Country and Family first…not last.
            You do not know the things he has done for people who were or
            are in need. He practices his religion without fanfare, not in

                 This is true elenadb2014, It is the radical Evangelicals
                 who are judging everyone else who does not measure up to
                 their brand of religious beliefs. Not everyone in this
                 country is a Christian, or they are moderate Christians.
                 Radicals in any religion are dangerous. As far as Mr.
                 Trump goes, he is what our country needs at this point in
                 time. We must get this country back on the right track,
                 if we do not, I don’t think that we will recover. We no
                 longer will be number 1 in the global arena. Victoria

                      Yes, you are right in that, radicals in any religion
                      are dangerous, but I can safely say that it WAS NOT

                      the first time. I definitely knew by the second
                      term. But he was elected both times. It was the
                      young people and blacks that got him the votes
                      needed both times. I have been around for many years
                      and I have a pretty good way of determining a
                      person’s abilities and so on. Now, that said, I will
                      agree with anybody that we didn’t have much choice
                      the first time of Obama’s election. Because McCain,
                      although I respect the fact that he was a POW of the
                      North Vietnamese, was not a good qualified choice
                      for president of our country. But on the other hand,
                      Obama has shown where his allegiance lies; and it’s
                      not with our country.

                 Separation of Church and State was born in the
                 allustrious Halls of the Supreme Court in 1947. There is
                 no such doctrine evidenced anywhere in our Constitution,
                 Bill of Rights, or any of the many Amendments. The
                 Founding Fathers did discuss the issue in debates that
                 are written in the Federalist Papers but it was about how
                 to keep the Government itself from creating a Religion
                 and forcing the populace to participate much like what
                 happened under President Obama with Healthcare that was
                 made mandatory or else face penalties. I suggest you do
                 further research before speaking on something that is so
                 widely held in error as fact.

            Really? I’d prefer a candidate that respects our

            Free Exercise of Religion. Now, Cruz’s faith privately does
            not bother me at all, but I’d think twice about getting some
            “Militant” Christian in here trying to force certain
            “Christian Values” or ideas upon the rest of America. It’s
            actually one reason why I respect Carson far more than any
            republican at this point because he knows our country is about
            the constitution first and to check any other extreme views at

            Presents those values you say Mark?
            What about this value:
            Better to stand back and be called forward than to step
            forward and be sent back.
            Cruz made that smug look of “Oh Well” as he walked on by
            Carson. Talk is cheap, and we saw how petty the one who calls
            himself “Ted” really is right there in that real world moment.
            Make Believe Marco is a jewel, as one can see the joy in his
            face as he understood the predicament Carson was in as he
            walks on past both Carson, and now Trump standing alone with
            Carson also.
            Bush looked like a cruel fool with that face he made as he
            walks on by both Trump and Carson.
            I’m sick to death of people talking the talk, and not putting
            that talk into action. Most talk, few do. Trump, (like him or
            not) walks the walk, he is a doer of good deeds. He has put to
            risk so much to save the America he loves.
            They told me when I was little to “Discern by deeds, not
            words”.
            And as for me; I Pray to God & I Vote for Trump

       extremely sobering in what has become a never ending cycle of lies
       and unkept promises by schooled politicians paid off by special

       How badly does the Left want to win this next election?
       .
       (1) badly enough that they would install shills at the polls –
       shills willing to break the law and encourage voters to support
       ‘the first woman candidate’ – that’s what they did in Nevada.
       .
       (2) badly enough that they would bring in trainloads of illegals to
       vote for Hillary? They are still doing that and have been for a
       number of years. Why do you think BHO just issued a No Arrest or
       Detain order to our Border Patrol? It’s why Liberal Governors
       declared edicts allowing illegals to vote. Why did they issue
       edicts allowing illegals to get driver’s licenses? (so they could
       show IDs when laws at polls required them)
       .
       (3) badly enough that they will encourage voting fraud (expect
       illegals in states not requiring Voter Identification to be bused
       from poll to poll for that purpose.)
       .
       (4) badly enough that corpses will be voting Democrat? (it is
       common practice by the Left, and corpses cannot be arrested.
       Without a doubt, some are already registered to vote. In fact, it’s
       already been reported that some ‘voters’ are 112 years old, so
       expect it.
       .
       (5) badly enough they would orchestrate and encourage
       vote-splitting? Consider the following:
       .
       (6) The recent poll showing Ted Cruz surging ahead of Trump has
       already come under scrutiny, has already been shown to be
       misleading. What did that accomplish? Cruz supporters went wild.
       They were envisioning Ted winning, although all other polls are
       showing he is lagging far behind Trump in second or in third place.
       The Left is fairly certain, what with their blatant disregard for
       integrity in elections (and in reality) that they can beat the less
       popular Republican candidate. To that end, they may well be pushing
       Ted Cruz to be the GOP nominee for that ticket. Hillary (with
       support from illegals, Muslims, Liberals and resurrected corpses)
       can beat Ted Cruz; she may have a harder time beating Donald Trump,
       and even the GOP doesn’t want Trump.
       .
       Please don’t be fooled. The Left will do anything to win this
       election; please don’t help them do that.

       the cut I switched to Trump. That moment spoke VOLUMES to me.

       It’s a nice thought and I’m a supporter of trump but that is not
       what happened at all. Both Carson and trump did not hear their
       names because it was so loud. I’m a little disturbed anyone would
       twist it into anything else.
