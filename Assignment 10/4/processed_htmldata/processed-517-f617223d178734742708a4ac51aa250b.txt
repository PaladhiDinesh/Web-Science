   [38]Values-led business

Can Amazon's new 'dream team' fix the company's sustainability reputation?

   Unlike most big companies, Amazon has never published a sustainability
   report. Recent hires suggest that may be about to change – but will the
   retailer play ball?

   After facing criticism over its worker treatment, recycling and company

   Amazon has a reputation for forward thinking, but when it comes to
   sustainability, the company has often fallen behind the times. For
   years, it has weathered criticism over its [47]worker treatment,
   [48]recycling and [49]other sustainability metrics.

   Recently, however, the online retailer has signaled that a change may
   be on the way. [50]Dara O’Rourke, a leading expert on global supply
   chains, has joined the company’s sustainability team.

   O’Rourke, 48, joins three other notable corporate responsibility
   executives at Amazon. Kara Hurst, the company’s director of worldwide
   sustainability and social responsibility, is the former CEO of [51]The
   Sustainability Consortium; she became Amazon’s first sustainability
   leader in 2014. Christine Bader, author of [52]The Evolution of a
   Corporate Idealist, joined Amazon last August. And, in December, the
   company hired [53]Christina Page, who led energy and sustainability
   strategy at Yahoo for eight years.

   It’s a dream team, of sorts. The question is, will it change Amazon?

   “They’ve hired great people,” says sustainability consultant Andrew
   Winston. “But we really don’t know what they’re doing. Amazon is a very
   quiet company.”

   In keeping with that reputation, Amazon didn’t make any of the
   executives available for interviews. Hurst and O’Rourke – neither of
   whom had previously been known for their reticence – declined to
   respond to questions via email.

   Ironically, O’Rourke’s career has largely been about increasing
   transparency. In the 90s, he drew attention to the issue of sweatshops
   in developing countries by exposing what he called “[54]exploitative
   and hazardous working conditions” in factories in China, Vietnam and
   Indonesia, [55]notably those supplying Nike. He later co-founded
   [56]Good Guide, which rates the environmental and social performance of
   consumer products, enabling buyers to make well-informed choices. Since
   2003, he has taught environmental and labor policy at the University of
   California, Berkeley.

   Dan Viederman, the chief executive of Verite, a nonprofit that aims to
   eliminating child labor, slavery and dangerous working conditions from
   global supply chains, says of O’Rourke: “He’s one of the most
   knowledgeable and independent people in the field.”

   climate targets to make a difference

   At Amazon, O’Rourke will be a senior principal scientist, leading a
   team called Sustainability Science, a spokesman for the company said.
   Amazon now has more than 50 people in its sustainability group, working
   on six teams: social responsibility, energy and environment, customer
   packaging experience, sustainability services, sustainability
   technology and sustainability science. A spokesman declined to
   elaborate on what each team does, but said the company expects its
   sustainability operation to grow significantly this year.

   There’s certainly plenty to do. For years, Amazon has been [58]mostly
   absent from the corporate responsibility conversation. In terms of
   corporate sustainability, Amazon continues to lag behind its
   competitors in the internet and technology industry, such as Apple and
   Microsoft, as well as rival brick-and-mortar retailers like Best Buy
   and Walmart.

   Unlike most big companies, it has never published a sustainability
   report, nor has it reported on its carbon emissions to the [59]CDP, an
   investor-backed nonprofit that has collected the most comprehensive set
   of global environmental data. It’s also not made itself a visible
   player in the environmental arena. Walmart, its biggest retail rival,
   has partnerships with respected nonprofits like the Environmental
   Defense Fund (EDF) and aggressively works to drive efficiencies in its
   stores and fleet, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in its supply
   chain. Best Buy has an industry-leading electronics recycling program.
   On recycling, Barbara Kyle, the national coordinator of the
   [60]Electronics TakeBack Coalition, has called Amazon the “king of
   laggards”.

   Its human rights record is harder to discern: unlike many companies
   that rely on global supply chains, Amazon does not disclose its
   overseas suppliers or publish the results of factory audits.
   Domestically, it is reputed to be a brutal place to work. Working
   conditions in its warehouses have been criticized in [61]a series of
   stories in the Morning Call, a Pennsylvania newspaper, as well as by
   [62]Mother Jones and [63]Harper’s. White collar workers are under
   pressure, too, according to an [64]an investigative story last year in
   the New York Times that was [65]strongly disputed by Amazon.

   include Dish Network and Rite Aid

   All of this might have been understandable during Amazon’s startup
   days, but the company is now 20 years old and – [67]at last count – the
   seventh largest US company by market capitalization, just ahead of
   Johnson & Johnson and GE.

   That said, Amazon has recently taken steps towards recognizing its
   social and environmental responsibility. It has invested in [68]wind
   and solar farms, and says that 40% of its electricity will come from
   renewable sources by the end of 2016. “They’re now on the short list of
   companies that buy large amounts of renewables,” says Winston.

   The company headquarters are Leed certified, and it promotes recyclable
   packaging. Citing a single study from 2009, [69]it says online shopping
   is inherently more environmentally friendly than traditional retailing.

   Yet Amazon Prime, a subscription service that offers free shipping and
   has helped drive the company’s rapid growth, remains a problem
   according to some environmental advocates. “Free shipping means people
   don’t think about the consequences of shipping,” says Amy Larkin, a
   former Greenpeace executive and author of [70]Environmental Debt: The
   Hidden Costs of a Changing Global Economy. In reality, she notes,
   shipping isn’t “free” – it requires packaging, generates carbon
   emissions and may create waste – and a sustainable economy would
   account for those costs.

   It’s not yet clear how Hurst and her team will advance Amazon’s
   sustainability efforts. But another technology company – Apple – has
   shown that getting the right people in place can turn around a
   company’s sustainability practices. Lisa Jackson, the former
   Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chief, has worked wonders for
   Apple, although to do so she needed the backing of the company’s new
   chief executive, Tim Cook. Apple is now transparent about its supply
   chain, a major buyer of renewable energy and [71]a visible advocate for
   climate action.

   Speaking of his company’s years of inertia, Cook said that “the time
   for inaction has passed”. It remains to be seen if, with his new
   sustainability team, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is echoing the sentiment.
