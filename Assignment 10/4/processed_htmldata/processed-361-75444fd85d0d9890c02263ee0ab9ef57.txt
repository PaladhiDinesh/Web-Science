     * Walmart is an excellent candidate for an income strategy. It's
       undervalued, a dividend aristocrat and performs exceptionally well
       in recessions.
     * The strategy involves the sale of a covered call right before
       earnings are announced.
     * This enables the investor to take advantage of inflated implied
       volatility which makes call prices more expensive than normal
       levels.

   Why [50]Walmart (NYSE:WMT)? We live in a world where yield is king.
   Central banks around the world have kept interest rates artificially
   low which have crippled retirees and savers alike. Japan has become the
   latest victim in the world-wide interest rate debacle announcing the
   move to negative interest rates last week. Switzerland also has
   prevailing negative rates and I believe before long, this may be the
   Fed's course of action also. Why? Well, volatility has spiked
   meaningfully this year and the Fed won't be able to keep its tightening
   cycle going if the likes of China and Japan are contracting. This is
   why we have to take the U.S. jobs number announcement on Friday with a
   pinch of salt. It will probably come in big again but jobs alone won't
   dictate the Fed's policy. In fact, most of the jobs being created in
   the U.S. are low paying service jobs and not high paying manufacturing
   jobs.

   Moreover, results this week showed that the service sector's growth is
   slowing down and equity markets suffered as a result. Therefore, with
   Europe, Japan and China itching to increasing their easing measures in
   the near term, the U.S. may be the next country forced to act. So where
   can investors find yield in a world where bond yield are at all time
   lows and U.S. equities look overbought after a 7-year bull run? Well
   firstly, protecting the downside is key, which is why Walmart is a good
   candidate at the moment. [51]McDonalds (NYSE:MCD) also thrives in
   recessions, but its valuation is a bit rich for me at the moment. Let's
   go through Walmart and discuss how it could be a high yielding
   hands-off investment for you in 2016.

   Firstly (and this could be the trend for 2016) Walmart has performed
   exceptionally well since the start of the year. The stock is up 8%
   already this year with the S&P500 down 6% (see chart below). Walmart's
   top line dropped to $117 billion last quarter, with the bottom line
   dropping to $3.3 billion in net income. Furthermore, the Walmart stock
   got dragged down last year due to poor bottom line guidance for the
   next few years. Walmart has decided to elevate [52]spends on staff and
   e-commerce, which will affect earnings in the near term, but revenues
   should remain buoyant. On the valuation front, Walmart stock's earnings
   multiple of 14 is still below its 5-year average despite the recent
   rally this year.

   The company currently offers a yield of just under 3% and because of
   the robust cash flows (trailing twelve months FCF is $15.94 billion)
   this company spins off every year, the dividend pay-out ratio is just
   over 40% which is attractive. Moreover, when you combine its solid
   financials and valuation with its great recession performance (EPS rose
   $0.20 to $3.39 in 2009), I think we have a solid performer here, which
   should provide a nice yield for 2016.

   So here is how you could play Walmart over the next 12 months. The
   company is announcing earnings on the 17th of February for its fiscal
   fourth quarter earnings. The time to put on this trade will be very
   close to earnings to ensure we sell premium for the maximum possible
   price. Here is a current option chain for Walmart. Since Walmart is
   presently trading in the mid-sixties, we will be looking at the 70
   strike in January of 2017.

   Source: Options Xpress

   By selling the 70 call for around $325, you are agreeing to give up
   your shares at this price if Walmart is trading over $70 a share next
   January. Now the $325 option premium plus the dividend of $196 (which
   will probably be more in 2016 due to an expected increase) equals $521.
   Irrespective of whether the stock gets called away from you or not,
   your yield or income for the year will be almost 8% (which doesn't
   include the potential capital gain of a sale at $70 a share). This
   strategy carries no more risk than holding the stock. It's a perfect
   hands-off strategy considering that Walmart has raised its dividend for
   40 years.

   Just make sure you collect as much as you can when selling the call.
   The implied volatility for the calls that are 12 months away is
   currently around 21% (see chart). This should increase going into
   earnings, meaning the $325 figure quoted above should be more when you
   put on the trade. If you are comfortable holding the underlying stock
   for the long term and don't mind potentially giving up your shares at a
   higher price, then this strategy is for you, if you want a hands-off
   income strategy.

   To sum up, strategies such as selling long-term out of the money
   covered calls on undervalued dividend aristocrats like Walmart is an
   excellent strategy for investors seeking yields much higher than what
   is available at present. The best time to invest in such a strategy
   (minimum of 100 shares is required) is right before earnings when
   implied volatility is inflated. Returns of 10% are easily attainable if
   the trade is put on correctly. Leave a comment below if you have any
   queries on this strategy

   A covered call doesn't add any extra risk to the trade in terms of
   holding the stock. The risk to the downside is the same - 100% in the
   stock. The risk to the upside is that you may be selling your shares
   for a lower price than what the stock will be trading for in 12 months.
   You are basically being paid a premium for agreeing to sell your shares
   for a fixed price.
