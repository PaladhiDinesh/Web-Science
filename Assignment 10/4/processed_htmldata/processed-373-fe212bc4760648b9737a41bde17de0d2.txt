       So far so good, the snow has just started falling. Supposed to be
       miserable today, freezing rain, rain, snow ‚Äì just wish we could
       have had a winter period. It is odd to know its February and to
       look outside and see the grass is odd. We usually have snow up to
       our first floor windows by now. So many ski areas and winter
       sporting shops are hurting this year.

       I am so glad to be inside today, it is snowing and accumulating
       fast. So glad I‚Äôm not out driving in this. Almost the end of winter
       and we finally get a nice blanket of fluffy snow. But its dark and
       dreary also so I think it deserves another day curled up with a
       good book!

       It‚Äôs been a fairly nice day around here. Temperatures were in the
       60s (bizarre) & it was really windy, but at least it was not cold.
       There wasn‚Äôt much going on today. Mom‚Äôs physical therapist didn‚Äôt
       show up or call, which is odd, so hoping nothing is wrong with her.

       So, I had to get out the old walker just to get around the house.

            Have you got a knee brace? I dislocated my knee a couple of
            years ago & essentially nothing was holding it together! The
            surgery last year has sorted that thank heavens but if I‚Äôm
            doing anything energetic I still wear a brace just in case.
            You can pick them up online really cheaply and it gives you
            that confidence back.

                 We do have a few braces around. I might need to get one
                 out! Usually, this goes away after a few days, but in the
                 meantime it‚Äôs a real pain in the behind. Basically, I
                 just don‚Äôt have any cartilage left in my right knee, so
                 I‚Äôm going to have to bite the bullet & have something
                 done.

       Today went by so fast, not sure where the time went but its
       nightfall already! Had a great day, nice and quiet all by myself. I
       like having quiet time all by myself at times, great time for
       meditating.

       It is so cold that I hate walking outside. But work prevails and
       every morning, despite the snow and cold, I go to work from 8am til
       8pm. Money I have but time I don‚Äôt. Adult life is hard.
