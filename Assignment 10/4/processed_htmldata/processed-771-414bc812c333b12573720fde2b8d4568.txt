[33]Jeb Bush's unpolished moments

   Nashua, New Hampshire (CNN)A very fired up[34] Jeb Bush brought a
   [35]New Hampshire crowd to its feet Sunday, when he called Republican
   presidential front-runner[36] Donald Trump a "loser."
   "It's a sign of weakness when you make fun of the disabled," Bush said.
   "What kind of man would do that? You do not want that man as president
   of the United States, I can promise you that. ... it's a sign of real
   weakness when you call [37]John McCain or Leo Thorsness or anybody else
   that is a POW, who served this country in a way that should be admired,
   American heroes. Calling them losers? Donald Trump, you're the loser!"
   The former Florida governor also made a passionate defense of his
   brother, former[38] President George W. Bush.

   "On Day One, I will not blame[39] Barack Obama for anything," Bush
   said. "I got sick and tired of hearing him blame my brother and I will
   never do it to him."
   Bush spoke hours after mixing it up in a heated exchange with Trump
   during Saturday night's Republican presidential debate, hosted by ABC.

   At a rally happening nearly simultaneously as Bush's town hall, Trump
   accused the former Florida governor as being the pocket of the
   pharmaceutical industry and called the chances of Bush becoming
   president an "impossibility."

   Bush also made not-so-subtle digs at Republican opponents Sens.
   [41]Marco Rubio and[42] Ted Cruz, whom the former Florida governor gave
   a back handed compliment when he called them gifted.
   "We have two gifted freshman senators that are also front-running
   candidates. They're gifted. Look, I got a monkey brain to be honest
   with you. I can't say the same thing, I can't say it. My mind works
   differently," Bush said.
   Rubio took heat from New Jersey Gov.[43] Chris Christie at Saturday's
   debate, when Christie called out Rubio for repeating the same phrases
   throughout his answers.
   Bush continued, saying message discipline was not his strong suit, and
   pointing to his brain.
   "It's fertile. It's growing. It's challenging. I'm always questioning
   myself. I'm intellectually curious. It's not all scripted. I think
   that's actually a strength to be President of the United States because
   you cannot script the presidency."
