From Lanterns to Lions, Ringing in Chinese New Year

   By [65]Suejane Chang

   Vice President, Walmart China

   February 05, 2016
   [?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.corporate.walmart.com%2F02%2Ff4%2F4a4ce4f242d79a
   556a84ff91f7bf%2Fchinese-new-year-celebration-lanterns.jpg]

   Feb. 8 marks the start of Chinese New Year, China’s most important
   celebration for families. Also known as the Spring Festival, Chinese
   New Year is a weeklong public holiday during which families celebrate a
   year of hard work and wish for good luck in the coming year.

   Those shopping in our stores in China see lots of Chinese New Year
   decorations and traditional foods stocked for this busy time. For
   readers who aren’t in China, here’s some background on the
   celebrations.

   Traditional Family Meals

   Before the first day of the first month in the lunar calendar, people
   all over China travel to their hometowns to unite with their families
   and decorate their homes in red — a color that symbolizes good luck and
   joy — and prepare for Chinese New Year celebrations. The night before
   the Chinese New Year, we prepare a [66]feast made up of symbolic foods:
     * In Chinese culture, a fish course represents wealth in the future,
       while peanuts signify longevity and good health.
     * Some food symbolism in Chinese New Year dishes is more visual, such
       as hot pot, which involves simmering meat and vegetables in a round
       pot at the center of the table. The shape of the pot represents
       perfection and satisfaction.
     * [67]Dumplings are an example of a food with a more historical tie
       because they resemble the gold currency — Yuanbao — used in ancient
       China. Today, dumplings are still thought to signify wealth in the
       coming year and are a delicious treat stuffed with different
       fillings.

   Celebrations

   Like with New Year’s Eve in the U.S. and other western countries,
   Chinese New Year involves staying up late. We light firecrackers at
   midnight, a tradition that dates back to ancient folklore. Though the
   New Year is a cause for celebration now, legend has it that Chinese
   villagers used to stoke their fires with bamboo to keep away a
   terrifying, sharp-toothed monster that arose from the sea at the end of
   the lunar year to prey on people and livestock. Now, we use
   firecrackers to celebrate the new year and also scare off any bad luck
   that might be on the horizon.

   Celebrations culminate in the [68]Lantern Festival, where people gather
   to admire the illuminated lanterns (some floating, some carried by
   children, some fixed as decorations) and guess riddles written on them.
   On New Year’s Day, people also watch lion dances, in which participants
   don elaborate, mythical lion costumes that seem larger than life — and
   eat rice dumplings.

   One of our family traditions is for children and grandchildren to wish
   elders in the family good wishes for the new year and, in turn, the
   elders will give children a red envelope of money for good luck and to
   buy toys and books.  Children often sleep with the red envelope under
   the pillow to bring good luck throughout the year.

   The Year of the Monkey

   This year is the [69]year of the monkey, the ninth of 12 animals in the
   recurring 12-year Chinese zodiac cycle. People born in the year of the
   monkey are believed to be energetic, witty and mischievous. I look
   forward to greeting the year of the monkey surrounded by my family and
   enjoying the snacks and festivities that come with the celebrations. No
   matter your Chinese zodiac, may the New Year bring good fortune to you
   and your family!

How Lab 415-C is Changing the Shopping Experience

   By [74]Tom Douglass

   Director – Lab 415-C, Walmart Technology

   April 28, 2016
   [?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.corporate.walmart.com%2F72%2Fa1%2F681addee4429b8
   0df3875a812c55%2Fresizes%2F1500%2Flab-415-c-exterior.png]

   Technology is changing the way people live.

   At Walmart’s Lab 415-C, we look for disruptive, innovative technology
   that has the potential to change the way people shop. But not just
   change that part of their lives – make it better.

   From augmented reality to robotics, our team discovers and tests
   emerging technology that powers the shopping experience our customers
   want. In fact, we’re even named after an early innovation in Walmart’s
   heritage: [75]Sam Walton’s 415-C airplane, which he used to scout real
   estate from the sky (a business-growth tactic that was unheard of in
   the 1950s).

   How do we bring these innovations to our customers and associates? It
   starts with research. You wouldn’t buy a car without researching its
   capabilities, safety and reliability, right? We research between
   700-750 technologies a year and make sure we know the technology’s
   maturity, use cases, comparisons and how it can improve shopping for
   customers. We look at everything from technology that helps associates
   run stores more efficiently to capabilities in [76]the internet of
   things (connected devices that communicate without human interaction,
   such as a smart thermostat).

   But what good is research if it isn’t shared with others? That’s where
   our showcasing team comes in. More than 5,000 people come through Lab
   415-C each year. Our showcasing team helps plan discussions,
   brainstorms and events within Walmart and the greater entrepreneurial
   and academic community to accelerate how we find innovative technology.
   Walmart Supercenter

   Testing technologies for how they’ll work within Walmart is another
   aspect of Lab 415-C’s capabilities. We’ve tested technologies
   internationally, at local stores and within our lab at Walmart’s
   headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas. Failing fast is key, so we don’t
   see failure as a roadblock; we see it as a way to finesse the solution
   to fit Walmart’s needs.

   An important way we find solutions that fit our customers’ needs is by
   sourcing innovations from technology suppliers. This October, we are
   doing that in a big way through our [77]Technology Innovation Open
   Call, an event where our leaders will meet with companies creating the
   latest technology for retail, logistics, big data, security and social
   media.

   Our open call event is a great opportunity for companies to pitch their
   innovations to the largest retailer in the world. I can’t wait to see
   what ideas and inventions we’ll discover! Together we will transform
   the shopping experience.

   Submission deadline for potential selection in the Technology
   Innovation Open Call is July 22, 2016, or the first 250 submissions.

A Full Moon Creates Chaos in this Exclusive Story

   There’s nothing like the chills you get from hearing a well-told scary
   story.

   Just in time for a late-night Halloween listen, filmmaker [84]Paul
   Soter (the creator behind comedies Super Troopers and Beerfest, as well
   as horror films Club Dread and Dark Circles) hearkens back to the
   spooky fun of classic radio theater.

   In Feed the Moon, what starts out as a simple trip to Walmart on
   Halloween night becomes one man’s nightmarish journey into the
   impossible.

A Brother, a Sister, and Success in Parallel

   Editor’s Note: With this post, we follow up with two associates who
   previously shared their stories on video.

   Proximity brought Nicholas Qualman to Walmart, but his personal drive
   has since taken him far.

   In 1998, the then 16-year-old was working for a fast-food chain located
   in the parking lot of the Walmart store in his hometown of Marinette,
   Wisconsin. He was tired of making burgers and wanted to work the
   counter, but with no positions open, he had to look elsewhere for a new
   challenge.

   He applied at Walmart and was hired as a cashier, and he hasn’t stopped
   moving since.

   By the time he was featured [92]in this 2011 video, he’d earned 10
   promotions. After that, he lost count.

   “I’ve had many careers within the same company,” he said, reciting
   every title he has held, which comes to about 16.

   His ambition has taken him from cashier to department manager to a role
   leading education for other associates and many – many – points in
   between. In the summer of 2015, he began helping to support the rollout
   and day-to-day operations of [93]online grocery, which includes
   [94]store pickup and [95]home delivery – a job that he says is his
   favorite thus far.

   “It’s a completely new way of us serving the customer,” he said. “I
   equate it with being the supercenter of this generation. It’s a game
   changer for stores and for our customers.”

   As Nick moved up in the company, he also moved around. “One of the
   great things is you get to experience different people and the company
   in different geographies,” he said.

   He transferred from Northeast Wisconsin to Minneapolis for college,
   then worked in Sacramento; San Diego; Los Angeles; Princeton, New
   Jersey; Boston; and Scottsdale, Arizona. He now calls San Bruno,
   California, home.

   Like Brother, Like Sister

   Nick’s drive can only be matched by that of his sister, Jessica Crow.
   It took her only five years to do what he did in 17 years, Nick said
   with pride and a bit of brotherly frustration.

   “We’re kind of in competition,” he said, “and I’ve got to tell you, I’m
   struggling to keep ahead. She’s told me several times she wants my
   job.”

   Jessica joined the military after college and served in Iraq and
   Afghanistan. When she returned to the States, she toured the country
   with the Pentagon to share her experiences.

   We're kind of in competition, and I've got to tell you, I'm struggling
   to keep ahead.

   Despite what she’d gained in the military, finding a satisfying job in
   the private sector was difficult, Nick said. She worked in logistics
   but didn’t feel happy or challenged. That’s when Nick offered to share
   her resume within Walmart. But, he told her he wouldn’t push it:
   Getting hired was up to her.

   It wasn’t long before Jessica was offered the position of developmental
   store manager. She made it to store manager in three months and moved
   to a new store after a year and half. A few promotions later, she is
   now a divisional manager – also surpassing the story she shared in this
   2013 video.

   utohide=1

   After talking about his sister, Nick was quick to point out, “My story
   isn’t unique – it’s one of many, many stories of Walmart associates.
   Not everyone has had a chance to tell their story.”

   Nick doesn’t want his story to end here. He achieved his last goal of
   joining the e-commerce team, and now he’s setting his sights on
   [97]Walmart International, the one area he says he hasn’t yet touched.
   For now, Nick sees himself sticking with [98]online grocery for the
   next five years or more – if he can keep his sister at bay. “I’m just
   worried about my job,” he joked.

What is Seamless Shopping? Q&A with CEO Doug McMillon

   By [103]Walmart Staff

   April 20, 2016
   [?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.corporate.walmart.com%2F27%2F46%2Fba532f7a45279f
   96764c038e4a0a%2Fwalmart-100715-218.jpg]

   The following conversation with Walmart CEO Doug McMillon is excerpted
   from our 2016 Annual Report, which was released today. [104]Read the
   report.

   IFRAME:
   [105]//www.youtube.com/embed/eTu0dMNcDHo?rel=0&wmode=opaque&showinfo=0&
   autohide=1

   Q: We’re now living in a new period of retail disruption, largely
   driven by rapid technological advances, and that change is likely to
   accelerate even further. What does the future look like for Walmart?

   A: Our work starts and ends with the customer. Technology has changed
   customer expectations. Customers used to compare us with the store down
   the street; now they compare us with the best online shopping
   experience. And beyond retail, they compare us with every business they
   interact with in their lives. They compare our pickup experience to the
   speed and friendliness of the best drive-through. They compare our
   checkout process to the ease of paying with an app.

   Customers should be able to shop on their own terms – in a great store
   or club, with a quick pickup stop on the way home from work, or with
   items reliably arriving at the front door. And customers want to have
   some money left over to put toward their priorities: an experience
   together as a family, a special gift every once in a while, or savings
   for a rainy day.

   Retail is not just about putting items on a shelf anymore. It’s about
   fighting for our customers, cutting out the hassles and advocating for
   them on price, too. We’re moving beyond just selling products to being
   the brand customers rely on to make their lives simpler and more
   meaningful as they save money.

   Q: You’ve mentioned “seamless shopping” before. What does that mean,
   and how will Walmart deliver?

   A: It starts with unparalleled assets that only Walmart has – our 2.3
   million people; more than 11,500 retail locations; e-commerce websites
   and apps; and a dynamic, optimized supply chain. But it also requires
   new capabilities and fresh thinking.

   This includes new digital tools for customers and frontline associates,
   as well as back-end software and platform work that benefits the entire
   enterprise. The use of data, algorithms, advanced forecasting
   capabilities – and more – is of extreme strategic significance.

   We will put these pieces together in a way no one else can.

   Ultimately, customers don’t care about what channel they’re shopping
   in, or about how we deliver them a product or service. They simply know
   they’re shopping with Walmart.

   Q: What is Walmart already doing to make progress against this seamless
   shopping strategy?

   A: To help our associates succeed and better serve our customers, we’ve
   made big changes – including investing approximately [106]$2.7 billion
   over two years in higher wages, education and training to make Walmart
   U.S. a better place to work and shop. We’re already seeing positive
   results: our fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 marked six consecutive
   quarters of positive comps and five straight quarters of positive
   traffic at Walmart U.S. Everything we’re doing in omnichannel depends
   on customers having great interactions with us in our stores.

   grocery pickup

   We're also accelerating e-commerce and technology advances globally. We
   expanded [107]Online Grocery shopping to new markets, ramped up
   in-store and in-club pickup, fully acquired the Chinese online retailer
   Yihaodian, and began to add new mobile services such as [108]Walmart
   Pay. We developed a technology platform that we can scale across the
   business. We improved our fulfillment capabilities with new centers
   that are helping us get orders to customers’ doors faster and more
   efficiently.

   Q: It’s clear what these strategic investments mean for customers. How
   will they affect associates and the communities where Walmart operates?

   A: As we work to win with our customers, we will also create a great
   place to work. We will create tremendous opportunities for people from
   all walks of life, with all kinds of skill sets and education levels.
   We’re striving to create a true meritocracy. No matter where you start
   from or what your unique and special characteristics are, you can
   fulfill your potential here. We believe in opportunity and that hard
   work, dedication and talent should be rewarded.

   We will create tremendous opportunities for people from all walks of
   life, with all kinds of skill sets and education levels.

   We will also use our size, mindset and policies and help make the world
   a better place. We create opportunity throughout our global supply
   chain – on farms and in factories, by buying more from women-owned
   businesses, by hiring veterans and by strengthening the retail industry
   workforce.

   We work to be more sustainable, both in our own operations and in our
   supply chain. We have three big goals: creating zero waste, running on
   100 percent renewable energy and selling products that sustain people
   and the environment. And we give back to the communities we serve –
   supporting American manufacturing, preparing for and responding to
   natural disasters and fighting hunger.

   Q: What does this growth plan mean for investors?

   A: We will win with a differentiated, disruptive strategy and a
   foundation of operational excellence. As we do, we believe shareholders
   will benefit by receiving above-average returns.

   Although this will be another year of foundational investments, we
   believe we will soon be growing faster than the retail market. We are a
   growth company; we just happen to be a large one.

   The road ahead will not always be easy, but by being customer focused,
   hungry, fast and accountable, we will win and have a good time doing
   it.
