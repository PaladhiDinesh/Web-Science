Second Avenue Subway Creates New Construction Haven

   January 20, 2016

   One of the city's most [12]affluent neighborhoods, the Upper East Side
   is a top destination for some of the city’s finest dining and retail
   options, museums, and of course, proximity to Central Park.

   Frankly, it’s good for anything... other than subway service.

   And yes, the Upper East Side is not the only area in Manhattan marked
   by an obvious lack of valid public transportation, it is the sole area
   that has been promised, for years — circa 1930 to be exact— something
   would be done about it.

   But years of doubt, by way of plans that never seemed to progress
   beyond paper, are in the past as the much desired [13]Second Avenue
   Subway line is currently underway. Within the neighborhood, subway
   stops only run along Lexington Avenue with sizable gaps in between. The
   line is intended to reduce that congestion, which includes extending Q
   train service in Manhattan.

   Undoubtedly, the addition is welcomed but residents and those who
   frequent Manhattan’s east side but with the progress of the city’s
   largest subway expansion in the last 50 years moving forward,
   developers have found ample reason to churn out new residential
   construction.

   Earlier this month, [14]The Real Deal mapped out some of the new
   developments popping up along and near the subway lines intended route.
   What is tallied as being nearly 900 new condos between 19 projects, 12
   will be located in [15]Yorkville, one of the enclaves in the Upper East
   Side most in need of the subway expansion. One of the developments in
   the area once referred to as Germantown, is [16]360 East 89th Street.
   The building, Citizen360, has already progressed six stories from
   street level of its total 34. [17]Designed by SHoP Architects, the
   building will consist of one- to four-bedroom apartments and possess
   3,265 sqft of retail space at street level.

   Just outside of Yorkville, 180 East 88th Street‘s Kolumba brick façade
   and bronze etchings bring an entirely new perspective of new
   construction design to the Upper East Side. Renderings of the building,
   [18]developed and designed by the Tribeca-based DDG portray a
   prominence and grandeur in a style that’s a breath of fresh air among
   its new construction counterparts.

   But 360 East 89th Street and 180 East 88th Street aren’t the only new
   developments to hit the Upper East Side. Developer Ben Shaoul and
   starchitect Robert A.M. Stern are also making appearances with new
   developments at 389 East 89th Street and 20 East End Avenue,
   respectively, and the influx of new projects surely won’t be the only
   ones to pop up by the time the expansion is finite.

   While current residents of the area look forward to that day,
   neighborhood newcomers will be following the yellow brick road that is
   the Second Avenue Subway and the starchitects that are building along
   it.
