What Would – and Would Not – Be Surprising in New Hampshire

   Last week, [27]we wrote that Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump are the
   favorites to win New Hampshire, and while there have been plenty of
   fireworks between then and now (Monday afternoon), our overall
   assessment hasn’t changed. Polling in the New Hampshire primary is
   often far off the mark — the electorate has a remarkably high number of
   late-deciders and switchers — but keep this in mind: Trump has appeared
   strong in New Hampshire for more than half a year. Since mid-July, he
   has led 72 straight polls, almost all of them showing a double-digit
   lead. And since early January, Sanders has led 38 straight polls, with
   most also showing a double-digit lead.

   So Sanders or Trump losing would be a big surprise. But what else
   should — or shouldn’t — shock us on Tuesday? Let’s look at some
   possible outcomes and separate the predictable from the unpredictable:

SURPRISE: Trump outperforms his polling

   Trump’s loss in Iowa showed deficiencies in his campaign. He did not
   have an adequate ground game and he has ignored traditional campaign
   tools and tactics. For instance, Trump [28]does not do internal
   polling, and thus he has no non-public data guiding his campaign. He
   also has generally eschewed the small, personal events that are a
   hallmark of winning primary campaigns. These shortcomings can matter at
   the margins, and they help explain why Trump’s support shrunk to some
   extent in Iowa. While it’s anecdotal, we also can’t ignore the frequent
   reports from journalists in New Hampshire about how many of the people
   at Trump’s events are not actually from the state or are otherwise not
   likely to vote. There’s a novelty that remains in Trump’s campaign, a
   novelty that probably makes his level of support seem higher than it
   is. Trump is at about 31%-32% in the polling averages. It would be more
   surprising to us if he exceeded those numbers than if he fell below
   them. But even if Trump falls all the way to about 24% — matching his
   Iowa performance — that’s still probably enough to win given the
   fractured GOP field, though it would be the lowest winning percentage
   in New Hampshire presidential primary history (Pat Buchanan’s 27.2% in
   1996 is the all-time mark). But such a result would also fuel even more
   questions about Trump’s ability to expand his support ceiling.

NOT A SURPRISE: Rubio finishes inside the top three

   Marco Rubio appeared to be rising in New Hampshire until his poor
   debate performance on Saturday night. His robotic, repeated talking
   points about President Obama played into a preexisting narrative about
   Rubio that he is too rehearsed and too green for the presidency. It was
   a bad moment, and one that his opponents and the national press jumped
   on. However, let’s not overreact here. There’s little hard evidence to
   suggest Rubio is sinking in New Hampshire or elsewhere. While some
   rival campaigns have suggested their internal polling shows a Rubio
   drop, it’s hard to take Rubio’s competitors at their word less than 24
   hours before polling locations open. Still, the expectations for Rubio
   are higher now, to the point where anything other than a top-three
   finish, and maybe even a top-two finish, would signal weakness. Rubio
   is well-positioned to inherit the bulk of voters who support candidates
   other than Trump and Ted Cruz as the field contracts. His challenge now
   is getting those other candidates out of the race, and a subpar showing
   by Rubio in New Hampshire would only embolden the others to stay in
   longer. Rubio’s mainstream competitors — Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, and
   John Kasich — also believe that if only they can survive to face just
   Cruz or Trump, or both Cruz and Trump, they can unite a big enough
   segment of the party to ultimately prevail. Judging by the Rubio
   endorsements trickling out from Capitol Hill, we think most Republican
   officeholders are coming to believe Rubio is the Trump/Cruz stopper. He
   needs to continue to prove that.

SURPRISE: Christie finishes ahead of Kasich and Bush

   Kasich has been something of a man apart in Republican debates. His
   message is generally less hard-edged than his competitors, and he
   rarely engages in arguments with his rivals (nor do they engage much
   with him). He doesn’t get a lot of time to talk, and he doesn’t produce
   soundbites that dominate coverage. But that might be a good approach
   for New Hampshire, where he is backed by the influential Sununu family
   and which has a big bloc of moderate voters who tend to prefer
   Republicans with softer edges than their opponents, candidates like
   John McCain in 2000 and 2008 and Jon Huntsman in 2012, who despite
   running a poor campaign that year still got about 17% in the Granite
   State. While Huntsman argued that his third-place performance gave him
   a “ticket to ride” to the next contest in South Carolina, he ended up
   dropping out before the Palmetto State voted.

   But for Kasich, 17% and third place might be a good showing. By not
   allowing Bush or Christie to get to his left, Kasich has positioned
   himself to do best among the three Republican candidates with
   gubernatorial experience. Christie appears the likeliest to show poorly
   in New Hampshire: His brutal attacks on Rubio, while potentially
   effective and a good use of his prosecutorial skills, were also a sign
   of desperation for a candidate mired in sixth place. Meanwhile, perhaps
   the deployment of popular former first lady Barbara Bush will add some
   points in a state that has sometimes been good to her family, but Jeb
   Bush could still find himself in fifth or worst, and as we’ve seen,
   money can only do so much if the candidate himself isn’t selling. As
   the race moves to South Carolina, Nevada, and the Southern-dominated
   March 1 primaries, even a governor who does well in New Hampshire, be
   it Kasich, Bush, or Christie, might not be able to build much momentum
   in the short term.

SURPRISE: Sanders wins by less than 10 percentage points or by 20 or more

   In the 18 polls with survey dates following the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses
   (in RCP’s database), Sanders has led 12 of them by 10 to 17 percentage
   points, two by less than 10, and four by at least 20. Thus, we expect
   Sanders is most likely to win the Granite State by double digits, but
   not much higher than the mid-teens.

   Of course, New Hampshire presidential primary polls can be fickle (on
   both sides): Just ask Barack Obama, who [29]led all surveys that
   sampled up to two days and the day before the Jan. 8, 2008 Democratic
   primary, only to see Hillary Clinton win in the end. There are a couple
   reasons for this volatility.

   First, an early primary election always contains some unpredictability.
   In a primary, a voter doesn’t have party ID to rely on when selecting a
   candidate to support; instead, he or she may largely agree with most
   positions held by the different candidates, meaning that more than one
   might be an acceptable choice. Up until the voter casts a ballot,
   there’s nothing to stop that person from switching allegiances. Spoiled
   for choice in their primary, Republicans find Rubio and the governor
   trio of Bush, Christie, and Kasich fighting for many of the same kinds
   of somewhat conservative or moderate voters. And some still haven’t
   finalized their decisions: Polls show [30]as many as 44% of likely
   Republican primary voters could still change their minds.

   But Sanders’ lead may be more certain because Democrats have only two
   candidates to pick from on Feb. 9, limiting the potential for
   vacillation; indeed, compared to Republican voters, polls show smaller
   percentages of likely Democratic primary voters expressing some level
   of uncertainty about their vote choice.

   Second, another complication is New Hampshire’s “undeclared” voters,
   who [31]can choose to vote in either party’s primary. With Sanders
   holding a solid lead in the polls, might some undeclared voters
   inclined to back him choose to vote in the GOP primary instead? Such a
   development [32]might help Kasich, who notably has higher support among
   undeclared voters in primary polling compared to registered
   Republicans. Reduced independent involvement would hurt Sanders’
   margins as he has a larger lead among undeclared voters than among
   registered Democrats.

   If Clinton comes closer than 10 points, she could try to spin that
   performance into a comeback, though it won’t be easy. If Sanders wins
   by double-digits, or even approaches or surpasses 60%, Clinton will
   find herself in a dark place. We know that she is well-equipped to
   fight back in the more diverse and less liberal states that come next
   on the calendar, but that doesn’t mean that the New Hampshire aftermath
   won’t be withering.

SURPRISE: Cruz finishes below the top four

   Ted Cruz isn’t going to win New Hampshire — he’s too conservative and
   outwardly religious for an electorate that is more secular and moderate
   than Iowa’s — and as we said last week, anything over 15% would be a
   strong performance for him. However, Cruz should be able to finish in
   double digits by picking up some pieces of the old Ron Paul coalition —
   the elder Paul finished second behind Mitt Romney in New Hampshire in
   2012 — while also doing well among the small number of New Hampshire’s
   strong conservatives and evangelicals. That very well could be all it
   takes for him to finish ahead of some of the other candidates who have
   put more of a priority on New Hampshire than he has. Any of the
   Bush-Christie-Kasich group who finishes behind Cruz in a state like New
   Hampshire will have to reassess their path forward. The same wouldn’t
   necessarily be true of Rubio in the unlikely event he dips below Cruz,
   but a strong comeback in South Carolina would become a necessity for
   Rubio.

NOT A SURPRISE: GOP makes New Hampshire primary history with five candidates
winning at least 10%

   Based on the aggregate data at [33]HuffPost Pollster and
   [34]RealClearPolitics, four Republicans are presently averaging more
   than 10% in New Hampshire polls: Trump, Rubio, Cruz, and Kasich. The
   10% mark is not only a straightforward cutoff point, it’s also the
   [35]statewide threshold for winning at least one of the 20 GOP national
   convention delegates at stake in the Granite State’s Feb. 9 primary
   (the state has 23 total but its three automatic delegates are
   officially unbound).

   However, because Bush is averaging just under 10% in both aggregators
   (9.3% in HPP, 9.8% in RCP), five candidates could garner double-digit
   percentages on Tuesday. That would be a first: In the history of New
   Hampshire presidential primaries, there has never been a Democratic or
   Republican contest where five or more candidates won 10% or more of the
   vote. In six instances, there have been four candidates who finished
   with 10% or more: the 1964 Republican, 1976 Democratic, 1988
   Republican, 1992 Democratic, 1996 Republican, and 2004 Democratic
   primaries. The closest call was the 1988 GOP tilt, when Pat Robertson
   won 9.4% to finish fifth behind George H.W. Bush, Bob Dole, Jack Kemp,
   and Pete du Pont. Yet in that primary Bush and Dole combined for 66% of
   the vote, whereas the combined percentage of the top-two finishers in
   this cycle’s GOP contest might not even form a majority. Given the
   heavily fragmented polling data and the uncertainty surrounding the
   impact of Saturday’s debate on the outcome, we could see an electoral
   traffic jam that creates five “10-percenters” on Tuesday night.
