Donald Trump makes millions in Muslim countries

   by Jim Boulden   [91]@CNNMoney December 8, 2015: 5:06 PM ET

   [92]Dubai developer sticks with Trump
   Dubai developer sticks with Trump

Presidential candidate [93]Donald Trump may want to ban Muslims entering the
U.S. but he's making millions from business deals in countries where Islam is
the main religion.

   In his latest personal financial disclosure required by all candidates,
   and on his web site, Trump lists various interests in the United Arab
   Emirates, Azerbaijan and Turkey, and two new ventures in Indonesia.

   Trump filed his income statement in July, and amended it in [94]August.
   Here's what he declared in predominately Muslim countries:

   Dubai, United Arab Emirates

   The Trump Organization has plans for [95]two golf resorts in the Arab
   emirate of Dubai. In the filing, Trump lists what is described as a
   "management deal with DAMAC Crescent Properties" and states the
   underlying asset "value is not readily ascertainable." He lists no
   income. Neither resort has opened, although one is due to be completed
   this year.

   DAMAC said Tuesday it would not comment on Trump's personal or
   political agenda.

   Baku, Azerbaijan

   In November 2014, Trump [96]announced a partnership to open a luxury
   hotel in Baku, Azerbaijan on the Caspian Sea. In the filing, Trump
   lists income of $2.5 million for "management fees" for the Trump
   International Hotel & Tower Baku.

   Azerbaijan, includes 72 luxury residences

   Istanbul, Turkey

   Trump Towers, Sisli is a 40-story residential tower in Istanbul,
   Turkey. On his web site, Trump makes it clear [97]he does not own the
   development, but the owners have licensed his name. In his filing,
   Trump lists royalty income of $1 million to $5 million. It's standard
   in the hotel business for brands to license their names for use by
   local owners.

   Indonesia

   Just a few months ago, [98]Trump announced plans for an ultra-luxury
   resort in Bali and a golf course in West Java, Indonesia -- his first
   in Asia. These deals came too late to be included in his annual
   candidate filing.
