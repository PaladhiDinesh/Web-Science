Project Overview

   Crowded train in Muni Metro

   The 19th Avenue/M Ocean View Project is a proposed major investment
   that would address crowding and reliability on Muni Metro through
   long-term improvements. The Project includes proposals for a light-rail
   tunnel under 19th Avenue, improved sidewalks and pedestrian areas and
   an off-street bike path.

Project Details

   [131]Project Factsheet PDF

   The Project is in its early stages of development. In March 2014, the
   San Francisco County Transportation Authority (SFCTA) Board adopted the
   [132]19th Avenue Transit Study that completed the feasibility study
   stage of the project by identifying and evaluating feasible
   alternatives.

   The Project has been advancing through the Pre-Environmental Study
   phase since July 2014, led by SFMTA. This phase will further define the
   project alternatives and prepare a Project Study Report (a type of
   “project initiation” document required by the California Department of
   Transportation (Caltrans) because the project would affect State
   Highway 1). We anticipate completing this phase in early 2016.

Outreach

   We are hosting a series of public meetings in February 2016 to share
   and get feedback on the refined project alternatives. There will be a
   presentation and a Q&A session. An open house will also be available
   throughout the meeting for more in-depth information.

   Officer ([138]kelley.mccoy@sfmta.com or 415.701.5428) with questions or
   to request a meeting or presentation to your group.

Schedule

   The project does not have a schedule for the next phases of work, but
   major milestones before project approvals would include:
     * A multi-year environmental review effort
     * Ongoing community outreach and involvement
     * Identification of a full funding strategy

   After project approvals, the project would be advanced to a more
   detailed level of design and then move forward to construction.
