‘McScuse Me, Bitch?’ — Woman With A McMullet Has Truly Epic Rant About
McDonald’s Customer Service

   By [20]Cass Anderson 02.08.16
   mcscuse-me-mcdonalds-rant-video

   Facebook / Knuckles

   Real talk, the entire time I was watching this truly epic video I had
   Archer on in the background. I’m now convinced that this chick ranting
   on camera about her crappy experience at [21]McDonald’s is the real
   life equivalent of Pam Poovey on Archer. Her voice, the inflection,
   it’s all 100% Pam.

   Now for the video itself, it sounds like this woman had a miserable
   experience at McDonald’s with one of the counter workers basically
   calling her fat, which goes without saying isn’t cool at all. This
   video was top notch up until the point she dropped ‘McScuse me’ and
   that’s when I decided that this is the best video I’ve seen so far this
   month:

   This video went up on Facebook roughly 24 hours ago and already it’s
   got over 12 million views…This is as viral as it gets. And I’m going to
   go ahead and assume that this took place in my home state of Florida,
   because this chick’s not wearing any warm clothes. It could’ve happened
   in Southern California but I’m really getting a distinctly ‘Southern’
   vibe out of this one. Other than that I’ve got zero details on this
   video, so if you know the origins by all means hit me up down below in
   the comments and enlighten me as to where the McDonald’s in question
   is.
