   It's being tested in Oklahoma stores.

   Months after implementing all-day breakfast that boosted the company's
   sales, a resurgent McDonald's is already testing the waters of menu
   expansion. The world's largest burger chain is rolling out all-day
   McGriddles and biscuit sandwiches at 72 restaurants in Tulsa,
   Okla., [24]according to the Associated Press.

   McDonald's [25]created quite a stir when it initially announced the
   crowd favorite McGriddle would not be part of its all-day menu,
   which [26]launched in October 2015 and which Eater NY critic and
   breakfast sandwich aficionado Ryan Sutton[27] declared king of the
   Mickey D's breakfast menu. Despite [28]some early concerns over the
   merits of establishing all-day breakfast, McDonald's saw a [29]5.7
   percent sales increase in its fourth quarter, effectively shutting down
   naysayers and apparently paving the way for further expansion of its
   24-hour offerings.

   But the McGriddles and biscuits come with their own challenges. Much of
   the early concern over all-day breakfast rested with
   each [30]restaurant's grill space and production capacity. The
   McGriddle's syrup-laden hotcakes, along with the biscuits, require oven
   warming (taking away space from lunch items), and could put a strain on
   individual restaurants' operations, in addition to hogging some real
   estate on the grills.

   Stay tuned to see if the McGriddles and biscuit sandwiches make it
   beyond the fertile testing ground that is Tulsa.
