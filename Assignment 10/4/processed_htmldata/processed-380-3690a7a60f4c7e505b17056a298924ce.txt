   Who doesn’t need more data. Ugh I can’t be the only one right? My data
   gets used up almost immediately which is why I am SO excited that I
   found [21]Walmart Family Mobile PLUS. I don’t want to (and can’t afford
   to) spend so much on my phone but I NEED MORE DATA! Walmart Family
   Mobile Plus has Unlimited Talk, Text, & Data which includes up to 10GB
   of 4G LTE. Keep reading, I’ll tell you your bonus prize for getting
   Walmart Family Mobile PLUS AND a have a fantastic recipe for Movie
   Night Chocolate Cashew Popcorn!

   [22]Walmart Family Mobile

   [23]Walmart Family Mobile PLUS is a live saver for me already. I work
   in an area without wifi most days – um I NEED DATA! I have basically a
   mobile office in my car (it sounds more fun than it is somedays!), and
   I need to stay in touch with emails, websites, etc. Thankfully now I
   don’t have to worry about eating all of my data in the first week of
   the month. Part 2? It’s a lifesaver because I am getting service
   everywhere. I love how great the coverage is!

   [24]Walmart Family Mobile 5

   The phone I chose is a Samsung Galaxy Core Prime – $79.92 (Rollback
   from $99.92). 1 I love that I saved money on it – thank you Rollbacks!
   2 I love it’s size. I don’t need a tablet pressed to my ear when I am
   on the phone. 3 I love that it wasn’t $800 and it’s really a great
   phone! Pretty happy with my choices!

   [25]Walmart Family Mobile 3

   So I haven’t even told you all of the good things about [26]Walmart
   Family Mobile PLUS! Yes of course I have more great news to tell you!
   Not only do they have a bunch of phones that are affordable,Walmart
   Family Mobile PLUS with all it’s perks ALSO gives you a free movie on
   VUDU every month. And you get ALL OF THIS for $49.88 per line a month.
   So let’s add that up, a phone with unlimited talk and text plus 10 GB
   of data AND a VUDU movie every month?  How awesome is this?

   Disclaimer: All prices for phones and plans included in this post are
   accurate as of the date of posting; however, these prices are subject
   to change. Please refer to [27]http://cbi.as/28aqc or your local
   Walmart for current pricing.

   I have 3 boys that are SUPER excited I have more data! We live an hour
   away from EVERYTHING so mom’s phone is a go to car “toy”. Now they can
   use it on the way to the Mall without me yelling about data and money.
   Everyone in my family is happy!

   [29]Chocolate Cashew Popcorn

   So because of the AWESOME VUDU free movie, we decided to make the first
   one a family movie night – and no movie night is complete without a
   movie night snack. That’s where the Movie Snack Chocolate Cashew
   Popcorn comes in. It’s SO easy – and the pay off? It was so delicious.
   Everyone gobbled theirs up while watching VUDU on our Smart TV!

   So to make your Movie Snack Chocolate Cashew Popcorn you’ll need:
     * Popcorn
     * Milk Chocolate (to melt)
     * Dark Chocolate (to melt)
     * Cashews

   Honestly THAT’S IT!

   [31]Edited

   Simply do this.
     * Pop the popcorn (air pop works best!). Cover 2 cookie sheets with
       wax paper and spread popcorn on wax paper.
     * Add in Cashews (as many or as few as you want).
     * Melt both chocolates. Then drizzle popcorn and cashews with
       chocolates.
     * Let chocolate harden and serve!

   See I promised it would be easy!

   Ok tell me – why do you need more Data? Is your life as crazy as mine
   and you’re NEVER home? Do your kids drain your phone? I’m dying to hear
   everyone’s stories of why they need [32]Walmart Family Mobile PLUS – so
   let me know!

       That is such a great phone choice – I love the style and you’re
       right, you can’t beat that value. Hope your boys enjoy the new
       phone and the movie perk (and snack) once a month! #client
