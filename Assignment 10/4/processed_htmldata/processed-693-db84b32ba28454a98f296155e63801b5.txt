   How conservative elites disdain working-class Republicans

   The conservative movement has a lot of ideas for improving the life of
   a typical coke-sniffer in Westport, Connecticut. Let's call that man
   Jeffrey.

   The movement wants to lower Jeffrey's capital gains taxes. It also
   wants to lower corporate taxation, which intersects with his interests
   at several points. It wants to free up dollars marked for Social
   Security so they can be handed, temporarily, to Jeffrey's fund-manager
   in-law, who works in nearby Darien. The movement has sometimes proposed
   giving Jeffrey a voucher to offset some of the cost of sending his
   daughter to school at Simon's Rock. If his household income falls below
   $400,000, Marco Rubio would give him a generous tax credit for each of
   his offspring. The movement also constantly hectors universities and
   media outlets to consider ideological diversity. Jeffrey reads these
   agitations and thinks of his libertarian-leaning daughter.

   And, if Jeffrey gives some money to conservative causes, figures in the
   movement will at least pretend to cheerfully listen to him as he says
   that the problem with Republicans is all these religious wackos and
   their pro-life nonsense. That stuff bothers his daughter. Privately,
   many of them would like to take Jeffrey's advice.

   The conservative movement has next to zero ideas for improving the life
   of the typical opioid dependent who lives in Garbutt, New York, outside
   of Rochester. Let's call him Mike.

   Maybe they will make a child tax credit refundable against payroll
   taxes for Mike. He could get a voucher for a private school, but there
   aren't many around and he can't make up the difference in tuition costs
   anyway. In truth, the conservative movement has more ideas for making
   Mike's life more desperate, like cutting off the Social Security
   Disability check he's been shamefacedly receiving. It's fibromyalgia
   fraud, probably. Movement spokesmen might consent to a relaxation of
   laws against gambling near Mike's congressional district, so that Mike
   can get a job dealing at a blackjack table. More likely Mike ends up on
   the wrong side of the table, losing a portion of the SSD check to
   Sheldon Adelson. Finally, the movement's favorite presidential
   candidate would like to put American armed forces ahead of a Sunni army
   outside of Homs, Syria, to fight Bashar al-Assad, ISIS, and al Nusra
   simultaneously. [50]Russia too, if they don't respect a no-fly zone.
   Mike's daughter will be among the first round of American women [51]to
   get a draft card. Mike reads this news and thinks, "Your momma wears
   combat boots" used to be an insult.

   If the conservative movement has any advice for Mike, it's to move out
   of Garbutt and maybe "learn computers." Any investments he made in
   himself previously are for naught. People rooted in their hometowns?
   That sentimentalism is for effete readers of Edmund Burke. Join the
   hyper-mobile world.

   And if Mike runs into a conservative reporter outside a Donald Trump
   rally, that reporter will then take to the pages of his conservative
   news outlet and talk about Mike the way a family talks about a distant
   dementia-afflicted uncle on his deathbed in a jurisdiction where
   assisted suicide is legal. Officially there's some concern expressed
   for the poor man's sanity. But the undertone of the remarks comes
   across as "Couldn't he just die already? We've got important things to
   attend to (in Syria, of course)." Who has time for trade protectionism?

   A recent example of the official right's [52]condescension toward the
   suckers in Garbutt or Chicopee appeared in National Review Online last
   week, written by the whip-smart Kevin Williamson. For Williamson, the
   Donald Trump phenomenon is just one of these periodic rebellions of
   Buchananites in the party. Poor fellows, they need to be put down,
   without concessions.

     The Buchanan boys are economically and socially frustrated white men
     who wish to be economically supported by the federal government
     without enduring the stigma of welfare dependency. [[53]National
     Review]

   Brave. Change the words "federal government" to "conservative
   billionaires" and "direct mail marks" and he could be describing the
   conservative movement itself. Like [54]Sir Edmund Spenser writing on
   the wild Gaels of Ireland, Williamson accuses the poor savages of
   confusing benevolent administration with a conspiracy to humiliate and
   dispossess them. Where would they even find evidence that [55]free
   trade has hammered their life prospects even as it granted them cheap
   plastic containers at Walmart? Or that immigration might be
   [56]depressing their wages?

   After excoriating these working-class Mikes — who may make up perhaps
   one fifth of the Republican Party — for playing patty-cake with white
   nationalists, Williamson offers some advice to the movement:

     Conservatives should continue to appeal to these voters, addressing
     the better angels of their nature with policy solutions to their
     problems, which are not imaginary. Confronting the stupidity and
     snobbery that holds in contempt those Americans who do work that
     does not require a university degree would be welcome, too, and
     Marco Rubio was well-advised to do so in his disquisition on welders
     and philosophers.

     But it is unlikely that such voters can ever be entirely assimilated
     into the mainstream of American conservatism, the universalism of
     which provides them no Them — and they want a Them, badly.
     [[57]National Review]

   You see, they suffer from Them and Us thinking, unlike us. The jerks.

   I agree that Trump's policies are insufficient, and [58]I doubt Trump
   would be loyal to them anyway. But Williamson offers no suggestions
   either. He knows there are none that fit into the straightjacket
   orthodoxy of conservatism any more. All we can offer Mike is a gesture
   at Marco Rubio's kind words for people like him. Let Mike eat tax
   credits. And after we call him a crypto-Nazi, he should come out and do
   the right thing: Turn out and help Marco Rubio ease the great burdens
   on the Jeffreys of the world.

   Time to think harder.
