New McDonald's Salad Has More Fat, Calories Than a Big Mac

   McDonald's Corp.
   McDonald's website boasts the "Keep Calm, Caesar On" salad bowl as "a
   nutrient-rich lettuce blend with baby kale, delicately topped with
   delicious crispy bacon, real parmesan petals and roasted garlic
   focaccia croutons."

   McDonald’s has put a lot of marketing dollars behind [63]revamping
   their image to [64]become a “healthy” fast food option, but one of
   their newest “simple” and “fresh” options for clean-eaters will do more
   caloric damage than a Big Mac, according to the chain's nutrition
   information.

   The fast-food giant recently unveiled a new line of salad bowls that
   contain kale, a leafy “superfood” that has become a sensation for its
   nutritional value and being packed-full of vitamins.

   “A salad so delicious, it might be hard to stay calm,” McDonald’s
   [65]website reads of the new menu item, the “Keep Calm, Caesar On”
   salad. But dieters might have a hard time keeping calm after finding
   their bowl of greens has more fat, calories, cholesterol and sodium
   than most of the other items on the entire menu.

   McDonald’s promotes the salad with crispy chicken as “a nutrient-rich
   lettuce blend with baby kale, delicately topped with delicious crispy
   bacon, real parmesan petals and roasted garlic focaccia croutons.”

   Although McDonald’s leaves out the dressing the salad comes with in its
   initial calculation of [66]nutritional information listed online,
   all-in-all this is the how the new “Keep Calm, Caesar On” salad with
   crispy chicken stacks up against other popular meals:

   Kale Caesar Salad Crispy Chicken
   730 calories (with dressing)
   10g saturated fat
   100mg cholesterol
   1140 mg sodium

   Bacon McDouble Sandwich
   420 calories
   9g saturated fat
   70mg cholesterol
   1050mg sodium

   Big Mac
   520 calories
   10g saturated fat
   70mg cholesterol
   950mg sodium

   10-Piece Chicken Nugget
   460 calories
   5g saturated fat
   70mg cholesterol
   820mg sodium

   Large French Fries
   560 calories
   3.5g saturated fat
   0mg cholesterol
   420mg sodium

   Regular Oreo McFlurry
   560 calories
   12g saturated fat
   45mg cholesterol
   390mg sodium

   Swapping out the “crispy” chicken for grilled is an option, but will
   only save you 160 calories. The American Heart Association recommends
   eating just 2,000 milligrams of sodium and 1,200 to 1,500 calories per
   day.

   McDonald's does offer other salad options that are not as hard-hitting
   to the waistline. McDonald's Southwest Salad only contains 280 calories
   and 490 milligrams of sodium, [67]CNBC points out, which includes a
   creamy southwest dressing. A side salad without dressing is only 15
   calories and 10 milligrams of sodium.

   A spokesperson for McDonald’s did not immediately respond Friday to a
   request for comment.
