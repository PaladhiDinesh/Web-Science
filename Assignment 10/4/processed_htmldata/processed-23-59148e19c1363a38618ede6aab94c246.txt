Connecting Crenshaw and Beverly Hills takes more than a subway line

   In his 2013 book, “Happy City,” urban theorist Charles Montgomery
   argues that car-dependent suburban sprawl makes people feel isolated
   and unhappy, and that a well-designed city is one that enables people
   to live connected lives.

   “The most important psychological effect of the city is the way in
   which it moderates our relationships with other people," he writes.
   Densely populated cities that encourage people to walk or take public
   transportation and offer a mix of housing types enable more personal
   interaction and thus, human contact.

   Bluntly put, Los Angeles’ sprawl doesn’t do it any favors in the happy
   department. The city’s iconic freeways were intended to ease travel
   from one neighborhood to another but instead have created siloed
   neighborhoods. Great gems of neighborhoods, yes, but separated by gray
   concrete ribbons.

   Crossing those barriers can be an epic undertaking.

   Thankfully, that is slowly changing. Los Angeles has made great strides
   in creating livable neighborhoods by encouraging walking and
   alternative transit. [5]A report released by SmartGrowth America and
   George Washington University last year ranked L.A. 18th out of 30
   metropolitan cities in terms of walkability. Not exactly spectacular,
   but the report also noted that “the future — of a walkable,
   transit-friendly Los Angeles — is being built right now.” New
   transit-oriented developments are being planned around [6]Metro
   stations and dense urban hubs such as downtown L.A., Long Beach and Old
   Town Pasadena.

   However, as Metro’s [7]declining ridership shows, simply building
   walkable neighborhoods and robust public transit isn’t enough to change
   the ways we interact with our urban spaces and each other. Angelenos
   have spent decades whizzing by each other on the freeways, alone in our
   little bubbles. And, for the most part, we’ve liked it that way.
   Physical and cultural segregation has long suited L.A. just fine.

   The problem goes a lot deeper than our preference for cars.

   In the late '60s, with the Watts riots still fresh in the minds of
   Angelenos, the Rapid Transit District (Metro’s predecessor) tried to
   pass a $2.5-billion plan for a transit system that would link downtown
   to El Monte, Long Beach, West L.A., Reseda and, most importantly, to
   the airport. Bus lines running from the city fringes to the trains
   would have created an even tighter-knit system. The bid failed largely
   due to the opposition of Hancock Park residents who feared the
   possibility of rioters gaining easy access to their neighborhood.

   In the 1980s, Westside residents opposed a Wilshire subway line to
   Santa Monica — resistance many argued was born of the same kinds of
   fears that put the brakes on the '60s transit plan. A methane gas
   explosion in the Fairfax area gave politicians sufficient ammo to push
   for the planned line’s derailment. It has taken three decades for work
   to once again begin on the “subway to the sea” on the Wilshire
   corridor. Despite its alluring moniker, the Purple Line still won’t
   reach the ocean-adjacent city of Santa Monica.

   It’s clear that Los Angeles needs to address the mental and emotional
   barriers that keep its residents apart. Changing that mentality —
   bringing Compton and Beverly Hills together — isn’t as simple as
   building a subway line.

   Unlike public infrastructure projects, however, it doesn’t cost that
   much to start introducing Angelenos to their neighbors.

   [8]Found L.A. leads quirky walking tours and excursions through L.A.’s
   diverse neighborhoods. The Ford Theatre’s [9]On the Road Program stages
   performances around the county — African dance drums in Watts or Zydeco
   dancing in Hacienda Heights — in an effort to bridge L.A.’s physical
   and cultural barriers.

   Then there’s the new peripatetic adventure [13]“Snowball Party” — where
   two strangers meet at a predetermined spot in the city guided by
   anonymous text messages. From there, the pair meets up with another
   pair in yet another neighborhood, and so on. Eventually, the group
   increases until 32 strangers suddenly have a wealth of experiences to
   bond over.

   Los Angeles is a city rich with culture and heritage. The city boasts
   the largest communities of Koreans, Iranians, Thai, Mexicans and
   Salvadorans outside of their own countries. Nearly half of the city’s
   population is Latino. Though it’s heartening to see such diversity
   reflected in the numbers, the reality is that we remain a city of
   enclaves.

   “Happy City” ends with an exhortation to “do the city” — meaning
   residents shouldn’t wait for the Los Angeles of their dreams to be
   built, but should take an active role in shaping the future they want
   to see. We build a happy city “by pursuing it in our lives, and in so
   doing, pushing the city to change with us.”

   It will take decades to build the transportation network and walkable
   density we wish to see in Los Angeles, but it only takes a weekend to
   step out of our comfort zones and dip into another version of the city
   we had no idea existed.
