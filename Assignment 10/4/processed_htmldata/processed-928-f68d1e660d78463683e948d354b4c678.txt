Obama Claims Job Growth

   [11][143543351.jpg]
   By Douglas V. Gibbs
   After President Obama's speech in Germany about the so-called economic
   success in the United States as a result of his policies, Politicus USA
   called it: [12]Obama Drives a Stake Through GOP Hearts By Dropping A
   Fact Bomb About His Economic Success.  You can call lies the truth all
   you want, but in the end, they are still lies, and our economy is still
   suffering from leftist policies.
   The problem is, we are growing at a modest rate, and last month our
   economic growth was less than zero.  The jobs Obama claims he has
   created are not good jobs, they are entry level jobs, part time jobs,
   the kinds of jobs an American must have two or three of to replace the
   income they lost when their full time job was destroyed by the Obama
   economy, and the 2008 crash caused by liberal policies regarding
   housing that has a foundation that dates all the way back to Jimmy
   Carter.  As the administration claims we have a lower unemployment
   rate, the true rate if judged by the method we used prior to 1995, one
   that would still consider unemployed individuals that are no longer
   receiving unemployment benefits as unemployed, has the unemployment
   rate at 23% . . . these are numbers compatible with what was going on
   during the great depression.
   So, we are being lied to, and the numbers are being manipulated.
   President Obama said in his speech that he cut the deficit by
   two-thirds.  Two-thirds of what?  The final deficit during the Bush
   administration was $458 billion.  Understand, that deficit was high
   because George W. Bush bought into TARP and the bailout to allegedly
   save us from disaster.  The first year under Obama his deficit was $1.4
   trillion.  The years following the deficit under Obama was $1.3
   trillion, $1.3 trillion again, $1.1 trillion, and eventually they got
   it down to $680 billion and claimed they cut the deficit in half.
   Obama’s proposed budget for the current fiscal year starting last
   October put us, based on their numbers (which you can fully trust,
   right?) puts us at a $474 billion deficit.
   That is like you having a subscription service somewhere for about $40
   per month, and then new owners take over and jack your rate up to $100
   per month.  The next month it goes up again, and again, the following
   month, until eventually it winds up that you are paying $300 per month
   for a subscription that you were paying $40 per month under the old
   ownership.  So you complain and they knock it down to $100 per month.
   You complain again, and they say, "What are you talking about?  We've
   cut your subscription rate by two-thirds, which is more than the old
   owner ever did for you."
   Meanwhile, over 100 million people are not working, and Obama is
   claiming he's creating an unprecedented amount of job growth, with a
   couple hundred thousand jobs at a time.  But these jobs are lower
   paying, lower skilled jobs.  I can't count how many people I've talked
   to that have taken two jobs to barely pay their bills that were easy to
   pay with the one job they had prior to losing it.  But the Obama
   administration, pointing at the guy that lost a job, and took two jobs
   to make ends meet, will tell you, "See, we've doubled the number of
   jobs!"
   We have a president with a scandal-filled presidency, but we are being
   told his presidency has been scandal-free.  We have massive
   unemployment, but we are being told that we have the lowest
   unemployment rate in seven years.  We have a 100 million people not
   working, and many of those that are working must settle for lower level
   positions and lower paying jobs, and we are being told that the messiah
   in the White House has somehow orchestrated incredible job growth.
   The worst part of it is there are actually people out there buying the
   lies, and believing the manipulated numbers.
