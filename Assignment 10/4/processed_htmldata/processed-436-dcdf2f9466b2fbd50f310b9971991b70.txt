   Update 11:45- The TBI says that 12-year-old Constance Nichole Morris
   has been located and is safe.
   TBI said she was found at Walmart in Oak Ridge. She is being brought
   back to Morgan County.
   They have not released any further details about the case, however they
   did reveal that one element of the Amber Alert system did not function
   properly.

   Usually, people receive Amber Alert information on their phones, but
   that didn't happen today.

   TBI said those alerts are triggered by a the National Center for
   Missing and Exploited Children through a system called LEAP.
   Authorities said that software did not work properly in this case.

   However, TBI said other parts of they system did work.

   "This morning's issue with the cell phone alerts is a perfect example
   of why we have redundancies in place when we issue AMBER Alerts to
   maximize the reach -- and the audience -- for the information,
   regardless of how technology performs. Our system, thankfully, works
   extremely well and has resulted in the successful recovery of nearly
   every missing child named in an AMBER Alert since the program's
   inception," said Josh DeVine, TBI spokesperson, in an email to 10News.

   Original story

   An East Tennessee Amber Alert has been issued for the Morgan County
   Sheriff's Office for a missing 12-year-old girl.

   Constance Nichole Morris was last seen around 8:40 p.m. Sunday near
   Lower Rockwood Road in Rockwood, Tennessee.

   Morris has brownish black hair, and green eyes. She was wearing a peach
   colored shirt, blue and black leggings, a black jacket and brown Ugg
   Boots.

   Morris also goes by the name Gabi. TBI said a brown and tan Dodge
   pickup was seen in the area.

   Anyone with information concerning the whereabouts of Morris is asked
   to call the Morgan County Sheriff's Office at (423)346-0911 or TBI at
   1(800)824-3463.
