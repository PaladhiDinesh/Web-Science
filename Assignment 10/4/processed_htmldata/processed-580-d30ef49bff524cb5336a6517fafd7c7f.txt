   Marco Rubio was mocked by his fellow presidential candidates for being
   robotic during the Republican debate on Saturday night.

   The debate was only one part of the intense week between the Iowa
   caucus and the New Hampshire primary. The gloves have come off for both
   Democrats and Republicans in the race for president.

   Asma Khalid is in New Hampshire ahead of Tuesday's vote. She joined RN
   Drive to talk about the way demographics figure in to the election, and
   what the race could look like beyond the first primary.
