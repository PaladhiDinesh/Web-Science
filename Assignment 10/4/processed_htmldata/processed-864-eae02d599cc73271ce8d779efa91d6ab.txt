   [36]That's Ba-Nanas

This woman kept her McDonald's Happy Meal for six years, and this is what it
looks like now

   [37]Sammy Nickalls / February 8, 2016 10:17 am
   This woman kept her McDonald’s Happy Meal for six years, and this is
   what it looks like now Facebook

   Sure, McDonald’s food may taste delicious, but it’s no secret that it’s
   not exactly the healthiest. However, one mother in Alaska has performed
   a McDonald’s experiment of sorts that is giving us the creeps. . .
   because it’s showing us visual evidence of *just* how unhealthy their
   food really is.

   Last week, Jennifer Lovdahl posted a picture on [38]Facebook of a Happy
   Meal. Sounds like an average Facebook post, right? Except this Happy
   Meal was purchased back in 2010. That’s right — it’s been sitting
   untouched for over six years.

   Lovdahl, who works in a chiropractic office, explained that the meal
   has been sitting in the office the entire time and “has not rotted,
   molded, or decomposed at all”— in fact, “it smells only of cardboard.”
   Yikes.

   And, indeed, the food looks pretty much brand new, complete with the
   January 8th, 2010 receipt. “We did this experiment to show our patients
   how unhealthy this ‘food’ is,” she explained in the post. “Especially
   for our growing children!! There are so many chemicals in this food!
   Choose real food! Apples, bananas, carrots, celery. . . those are real
   fast food.”

     It’s been 6 years since I bought this “Happy Meal” at McDonald’s.
     It’s been sitting at our office this whole time and…

     Posted by [39]Jennifer Lovdahl on [40]Wednesday, February 3, 2016

   The post has been shared almost 200,000 times, with dozens commenting
   expressing their shock and disgust. Of course, this isn’t the only time
   McDonald’s food has shown its remarkable lack of age. Last year,
   [41]two men in Adelaide, Australia opened up a McDonald’s burger they
   had purchased in 1995, only to find there was absolutely no mold
   whatsoever.

   There you have it, folks: Visual evidence of just how un-foodlike fast
   food really is. Although fast food can be a delicious treat every now
   and then, it should no means be a regular dish, because nobody needs
   that crazy number of preservatives in their life. We are NOT lovin’ it.
