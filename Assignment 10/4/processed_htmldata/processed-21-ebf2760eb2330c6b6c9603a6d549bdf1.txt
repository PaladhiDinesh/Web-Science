   He's certainly worked up an appetite with some late nights in New York
   City partying with Hailey Baldwin.

   And on Wednesday [71]Justin Bieber was spotted satisfying his cravings
   as he munched on a massive Subway sandwich while traipsing through the
   Big Apple.

   The 21-year-old covered up with high socks and an oversize hooded
   sweatshirt despite the scorching 88ºF late summer heat.

   It was not exactly clear if the pop star had opted for cheese in his
   sandwich but he did appear to have gone with sliced turkey and a robust
   dollop of mayonnaise.

   Bieber completed his street attire with a cap, Adidas Yeezy Boost
   trainers, and large baggy basketball shorts as he munched along through
   the busy metropolis.

   Kris Jenner's boyfriend Corey Gamble - who is ever by the popstrel's
   side - was also busy at work attending to Bieber during the outing.

   At one point the Baby singer and his entourage stopped on the street to
   say hello to a passing friend, and Bieber even gave the young man a
   tender hug.

   Meanwhile,  both Hailey and Justin insist they're 'single' but there's
   no disputing the close connection between them.

   Doing their best to avoid further speculation about their relationship,
   Bieber and Baldwin attempted to go incognito by shielding their faces
   on exiting a nightclub together on Tuesday.

   Bieber, 21, and 18-year-old Hailey were seen leaving Up and Down
   Nightclub in NYC and hopped into the same car, despite going to effort
   to make it seem like they weren't together.

   While Bieber and Hailey have never confirmed a relationship, they've
   insisted quite the opposite in that they're single.

   Just this week, talking to Kyle And Jackie O Radio Show, Bieber
   revealed: 'I haven't been in a relationship for a while now. I'm
   chilling and just hanging out and just being by myself. I'm a
   relationship type of guy.
   Just friends? Bieber, 21, and 18-year-old Hailey Baldwinwere seen

   YSL!

   Hailey is too cool for school in Saint Laurent's youthful
   leather-trimmed varsity bomber jacket. Saint Laurent took a classic
   approach to this collegiate throwback with its crop waist line and snap
   button closures. The jacket's simple colors are a subtle approach to
   what usually ends up as a hideous mix-and-match of school colors way
   outside your comfort zone.

   Just about every designer has crafted a version of this jacket, yet
   Saint Laurent's creation with its contrast collar, cuffs and waist make
   this time-honored trend versatile. The varsity style is undeniably
   cool. and its boyish appeal it makes any wearer an MVP.

   But not all of us are ballers so $2500 may be a bit out of our league,
   so check our similar selections below. They're far being sophomoric.

   'I love to be in love and I love cuddling and I love all of that kind
   of stuff. But I got my heart broken and so I'm just going to let that
   heal up.'

   The friends have been linked romantically as early as January 2015, but
   it's thought that the comments refer to Bieber's previous famous
   relationship with Selena Gomez.

   Selena and Bieber split in October 2014 and even since there's been
   rumours of his tryst with Hailey.

   'I'm single,' she wrote on the social media site in April. 'So everyone
   just quit while you're ahead with the assumptions.'

       moving in a gender-equal world¿I had a sense of it, but I didn¿t
       start to really see evidence of it, I think, until I hit puberty.
       Media even before that age is already creating all these biases.
       \nDAVIS: And it¿s like, is this not the 21st century? I mean,
       really? But that isn¿t what made me do the research. I just started
       asking my friends if they had noticed. None of them¿feminists,
       mothers, daughters¿noticed until I pointed it out. Then I decided
       to bring it up within the industry. I knew a lot of people, so I¿d
       say, ¿Have you ever noticed how few female characters there are in
       kids movies?¿ when I met a director, a producer, whatever. And they
       said, ¿Oh, but that¿s not true anymore.¿ Then they would name a
       movie with one female character as the proof that things had
       changed. [Watson laughs] My point was the world is missing female
       characters. A lot of times 'I have so much experience!' Geena Davis
