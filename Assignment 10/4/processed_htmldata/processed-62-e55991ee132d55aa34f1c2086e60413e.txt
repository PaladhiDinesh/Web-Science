New York City's Other Subway

   For many, the story of subterranean travel in New York begins in
   October 27, 1904, when the first underground line of the Interborough
   Rapid Transit Company began to operate from City Hall to 145th Street
   and Broadway. But in reality, underground transit in New York began 34
   years earlier—in a stranger-than-fiction saga that involves a secret
   dig, a massive success, and unheard-of political corruption.

   The year was 1869, and a man named Alfred Ely Beach had a big idea. At
   the time, Beach was [32]best known as the publisher of Scientific
   American, which he purchased from its founder with a friend just 10
   months after it was first printed. (Beach was also known for running a
   school for freedmen after the Civil War and patenting an early
   typewriter.)

   Like most New Yorkers before and since, Beach hated the city’s
   notorious traffic. The streets were crowded with horses, carts, and
   hordes of frustrated people, including the inventor. Beach was familiar
   with London’s [33]new Metropolitan Railway, the world’s first
   underground subway system. But building the subway had been a huge
   investment of time and a gigantic disruption of the city—not exactly
   something that seemed viable for cash-strapped New York.

   This directly conflicted with Beach’s grand vision, which involved the
   relatively new concept of pneumatic tubes. The idea was already being
   used to push capsules containing letters at the London Stock Exchange,
   and Beach wanted to turn the technology into a game changer for New
   York. He became a bona fide [34]pneumatic tube pusher, proposing their
   use for businesses in New York and, eventually, public transit. The
   idea was almost deceptively simple. “A tube, a car, a revolving fan!”
   he wrote breathlessly. “Little more is required.”

   Soon Beach was convinced that pneumatic tubes were the solution for New
   York’s traffic problem. But [35]Boss Tweed, the head of the political
   machine that was the city’s Tammany Hall, disagreed. When Beach applied
   for a permit, Tweed turned it down (likely because he was involved in
   building an above-ground transit system—and collecting huge amounts of
   graft in the process). So Beach did what any intrepid inventor would
   do: He got permits to build pneumatic mail tubes instead, then set
   about building a full-blown demonstration subway under the guise of a
   piddly mail delivery project.

   Fifty-eight days after construction began, Beach’s secret tunnel was
   ready to unveil to the public. It was only about a block long, but it
   was long enough. It also almost unleashed a public firestorm when
   [36]newspapers claimed that the pneumatic tube people were causing
   Broadway to sink. Beach created a distraction and avoided a PR
   catastrophe by holding a star-studded reception underground. He
   entertained guests in an elaborate waiting room complete with a
   fountain filled with goldfish, chandeliers and a grand piano, then
   [37]whisked passengers about 300 feet on a subway car.

   It was nothing less than a sensation. Not only did Beach collect
   25-cent fares [38]from over 400,000 passengers in the first year, but
   he demonstrated that it was possible to move passengers safely beneath
   the city. Beach’s next step was to try to extend the line, but
   political interference from Tweed and other legislators and waning
   public interest sucked the life out of the plan like, well, a pneumatic
   fan in the years that followed. (Read Joseph Brennan’s epic account of
   the ins and outs of the political drama and technical challenges of the
   system [39]here.)

   Though Beach’s vision of a pneumatic underground subway system never
   went further than a few hundred feet, another one of his concepts
   lasted much longer. Beach himself didn’t build the underground
   pneumatic mail system [[40]PDF] that ran beneath the city from 1897 to
   1953, but he surely helped inspire it.

   The Beach Pneumatic Station was soon forgotten and periodically
   rediscovered, [41]then annihilated when the City Hall subway station
   was built in 1912. The system’s closed car and tunnel shield [42]were
   initially preserved, but have since been lost. How would New York
   transit look today if his idea hadn't flopped? We'll never know—but
   it's fun to dream about an alternative timeline filled with Beach's
   underground, undercover pneumatic trains.
