   mm On her show Tuesday night, Megyn Kelly interviewed Oscar-winning
   lefty documentarian Michael Moore, but rather than promote his latest
   movie, the impish provocateur seemed to want to discuss nothing so much
   as her ongoing feud with Donald Trump, and what he characterized as the
   “crisis” she had created at Fox News.

   “What does this feel like for you?” Moore asked right out of the gate.
   “‘Cause you don’t want to be the story. You’re a journalist.”

   Tuesday’s big news, of course, was that after assailing Kelly
   with criticisms of bias and [23]receiving a series of smart-aleck
   statements from her network, Trump finally [24]declared that he would
   not attend Thursday night’s GOP debate, which Kelly is scheduled to
   co-moderate.

   “What is he afraid of?” Moore asked. “I’m sitting here. I don’t feel
   any fear.”

   To his credit, Moore seemed to understand that he was unlikely to
   inspire any of Kelly’s viewers to see his new movie, Where to Invade
   Next: “Pluggin’ a movie? No, that’s not why I’m here! I’m on Fox News!”
   he joyously proclaimed.

   Instead, he devoted a great deal of his time to needling Kelly for the
   role she inadvertently played in unraveling the media-political fabric
   of the nation. Moore told Kelly:

     Michael Moore: You have done something that Jeb Bush, Chris
     Christie, Rubio, Cruz, none of them have been able to do, which is
     to essentially frighten him, make him run, shut him down.

     Megyn Kelly: Would you move on from the Trump situation?

     MM: Everyone has tried to do this for months — but you did it!

     […]

     MM:To get elected president in this country, you have to come on
     this network. You have to play ball with this network. Donald Trump
     today said I’m not playing ball with this network. That’s a historic
     moment! […] You’ve made this happen. You’ve caused a crisis
     upstairs.

   Moore seemed sincere in his praise for the host, applauding her for
   asking the “great question” at the August Republican debate, regarding
   Trump’s record of belittling women, which got this whole circus
   started. “God bless you, Megyn Kelly!” he concluded.

   If Moore will not tout his own new release, then perhaps we will. Where
   to Invade Next will be in theaters Feb. 12. You can view the trailer
