This Is What A McDonald’s Happy Meal That’s Been Untouched For Six Years
Looks Like, And Yeah I’d Probably Still Eat It

   My standards when it comes to food are pretty low; my only requirements
   are that it’s not got mold festering all over and that there’s zero
   cooked onions. No exceptions.

   So imagine how hungry I am staring at this 6-year-old McDonald’s Happy
   Meal that both has no mold and no onions, considering I haven’t had
   breakfast yet today because I’m too lazy to get up and make myself a
   bagel:

   Mmmmmmm, tasty. Here I was, trying to figure out what to eat for lunch
   when this lil’ baby popped up on my screen. Problem solved! Granted,
   food is supposed to rot and get moldy when it’s been left out, but so
   what? The added chemicals just give it that nice obesity-laced flavor
   we all know and love. Besides, I’ve been told that devouring the souls
   of young children will keep your skin from aging, and this Happy Meal
   is the same age as your average 1st grader so I’m thinking it’s an
   acceptable substitute.
