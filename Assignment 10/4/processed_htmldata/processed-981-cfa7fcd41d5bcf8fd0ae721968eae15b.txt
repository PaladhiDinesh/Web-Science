[28]How to Grow Wisteria

   Wisteria is a plant species with woody vines that can be commonly seen
   in the eastern part of the United States as well as in some Asian
   countries like Japan, Korea and China. The vines of the plant can reach
   20 meters high and these can spread out 10 meters. The plant is used as
   food to Lepidoptera species’ larvae. In some countries such as Japan
   and China, the plant is used as ornament. If you are interested in
   learning how to grow wisteria, it is important that you start with
   identifying the best place where the plant will grow. Additionally, it
   is necessary that you have ideas about the proper watering of the
   plant.

   Materials Needed

   When planting wisteria, it is best that you start with getting all the
   materials needed for the cultivation of the plant. The materials that
   you will need for this project are glass jar, water, flowerpot,
   wisteria seeds as well as seeding compost.

   Procedures

   The initial step in planting wisteria is to germinate the seeds. The
   most appropriate time to do this is in the early part of March or the
   early part of April. Pour water in the jar. Make sure that ¾ of the jar
   is filled with water. Pour the seeds in the jar. Soak the seeds for a
   day.

   Remove the seeds from the jar. Put seedling compost in a pot. Transfer
   the seeds in the pot. Sprinkle wisteria seeds in the pot. Cover the pot
   with a layer of compost. Mist the top part of the soil with the use of
   a spray bottle.

   Location

   Where does wisteria grow? The plant grows well in areas with cold
   climate. In this regard, it is best that you put the pot with wisteria
   seeds in the part of the house with cold temperature. You can also
   place the pot in the greenhouse. If you plant to grow the plant indoor,
   you can place it in a windowsill. Make sure that the places where you
   will plant the seeds have sufficient sunlight.

   As soon as the seeds have sprouted, it is best to transfer these into
   different pots. When transferring into several pots, always check if
   the soil in the pots is fertile. You can water the plant thrice in a
   week to enhance its growth. Remove withered leaves from the plant. It
   is also important to remove weeds surrounding the plants to enhance the
   growth of wisteria. Above all, always remember to apply organic compost
   or fertilizer in the soil where the plants are cultivated.
