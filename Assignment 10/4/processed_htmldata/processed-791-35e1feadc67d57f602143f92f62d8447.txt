On Monday’s Breitbart News Daily, Donald Trump’s Senior Policy Adviser
Stephen Miller said this election represents “binary choice” that boils down
to a decision of “nation-state versus globalism.”

   Miller warned that that nation is “at a tipping point” and is “nearing
   a point of no-return.” The election, Miller explained, represents an
   opportunity to break from Washington politicians’ longstanding
   adherence to the “globalist ideology,” which has not served the
   interest of the American people.

   “You have one candidate with a clear position on understanding that a
   country has to serve the interests of its own people, not just the
   interests of international commerce,” Miller said.

   “Donald Trump is the only person who can change the system so it works
   for working Americans… he is the only candidate now who in multiple
   debates has laid out a pro-American trade policy– the only candidate,”
   Miller explained. “If you want a candidate who’s going to advance a
   trade policy that serves you and your family, there is only choice to
   make. It’s as simple as that.”

   “A pro-American trade policy is a trade policy that protects and
   preserves American manufacturing. Understanding that it is the economic
   interest, security interest, and social interest of the United States
   to have a manufacturing base in this country… You can’t just be a
   service economy… and he [Trump] understands that.”

   Miller explained that if the U.S. does not start making good trade
   deals, “jobs will disappear and never come back. We’ve seen it in New
   Hampshire, we’ve seen it in South Carolina, we’ve seen it all across
   this country.”

   Miller previously served as the communications director for the man who
   had led the conservative opposition to Obama’s trade agenda, Sen. Jeff
   Sessions (R-AL).

   Miller warned that President Obama’s Trans-Pacific Partnership
   agreement, which has been previously endorsed by many of Trump’s
   rivals, “is potentially that point of no return… if we go down that
   road, we may lose industry after industry after industry. And more
   importantly– or more tragically– our sovereignty with it.”

   Trump, Miller explained, is “the only candidate who has been strong and
   consistent in his opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And so
   that it is an issue where it is as clear as black and white–it is a
   binary choice– if you want a candidate who’s going to advance a trade
   policy that serves you and your family, there is only one choice to
   make. It’s as simple as that.”

   Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) previously endorsed President Obama’s
   Trans-Pacific Partnership, on multiple occasions. Similarly Sen. Ted
   Cruz (R-TX) had initially supported President Obama’s trade agenda–
   having co-authored an op-ed with Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) in the Wall
   Street Journal in favor of fast-tracking the deal. Cruz later reversed
   his support citing specific concerns about the deal’s provisions
   regarding immigration law and the export-import bank.

   Breitbarts News Daily host and Breitbart News Executive Chairman
   Stephen K. Bannon pressed Miller on the criticism Trump’s pro-American
   trade policy has received from professional Republicans. Bannon said:

     So the GOP smart-set– all the guys at National Review and all of the
     guys at the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal– are going to
     start mocking you and mocking Donald Trump right now. [They’ll say:]
     ‘This whole idea that you’re going to bring back jobs 10 million
     jobs from China is a total fantasy.’ [To] everything you just said,
     [they’ll say], ‘These guys are Luddites, they’re anti-technology,
     all those types of jobs should go to China, they should go to
     Mexico, because we’re going to have a whole service economy that’s
     going to drive this country… We’re a post-industrial society and you
     guys are talking about something from the 19th Century.’ What say
     you, Mr. Miller?

   “Part of being a conservative is looking at results. We’ve followed the
   globalist ideology– and it’s an ideology. It is not fact-based,” Miller
   said.

   This election, Miller explained, comes down to, “nation-state versus
   globalism. And the reality is, is that the results. The record is in.
   The jobs haven’t come back, wages haven’t gone up, communities haven’t
   been rebuilt. The jobs left, the wages left, the incomes left, and they
   never came back and only Donald J. Trump is going to bring them back.”

     Donald Trump is a builder. He’s a person who creates building, and
     products and jobs and builds up communities, builds these beautiful
     golf courses– he understands that for a country to be great, it has
     to be a country that manufactures, and builds, and produces. You
     can’t just be a service economy. You have to have actual durable
     goods that you are producing, and he understands that. And as a man
     who has done business all around the world, he also understands that
     there’s theory and then there’s reality. And when you’re making a
     deal, when you’re sitting across the table from a ruthless
     negotiator you have to strike a good deal for your interests. As
     President, he’ll strike a good deal for America…

   “If you wake up in the morning and you believe that the system hasn’t
   been working for you, if you don’t think your politicians have your
   best interests at heart, if you think they’re bought and paid for, then
   it’s very simple: you’re going to be voting for Donald J. Trump for
   President.”
