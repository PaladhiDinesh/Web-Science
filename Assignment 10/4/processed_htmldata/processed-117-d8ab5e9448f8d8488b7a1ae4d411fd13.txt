   Looks like one raccoon wasn’t going to let groundhogs get all the
   attention today.

   Commuters at Spadina Station were shocked to see a nocturnal passenger
   on the subway Tuesday morning when a raccoon hopped on and tried to
   head south.

   TTC spokesperson Brad Ross said they’re not sure how the raccoon got
   into the station.

   “From time to time, wildlife and other animals do make their way onto
   our property,” Ross said. “He did appear very harmless and very young,
   more curious than anything.”

   [35]Carl Fernandez documented the raccoon’s adventure on Twitter.

   “I was closing my eyes on the subway heading off to work when I heard
   the commotion. I thought maybe it was a fight and saw people getting
   up,” Fernandez explained. “Then I finally saw the raccoon, just
   casually walking up the aisle of the subway.”

   The adorable creature strolled onto the subway during the morning rush
   hour, only to change his mind and decide to walk.

   “This was better than coffee, it woke me right up, I was sleeping and
   there was no sleeping afterward,” Fernandez joked. “Some people were
   screaming and were getting out of the way. Some people just stood there
   and the racoon just passed them by.”

   Subway service southbound at Spadina was briefly delayed but video from
   the the scene showed those at the station didn’t seem to mind.

   After a little stroll along the platform, Ross said the animal
   disappeared into the tunnel.

   “He probably has a den or nest somewhere that has access to the
   tunnel,” he explained.

   This isn’t the first time raccoons have opted for public transit to get
   around the GTA.

   In December, a raccoon stowed away on a morning Aldershot GO Train.

     have used some extra sleep. [47]#GOTrain

   Anne Marie Aikins, spokesperson for Metrolinx, said they closed off the
   coach to other passengers until they got to Aldershot, when the raccoon
   was safely removed from the train.
