“Inspiration” and “Politicking” Right Here in Londonderry

   First of all you just can’t argue that we live in the very best State
   in the Country… New Hampshire!  I can feel it in the air and see it in
   our development that great things are just beginning and to come!  My
   dream for Londonderry and New Hampshire is that this is a place, state
   that our children want to stay in, raise their families in and always
   come back too… and that’s what’s happening now!  Londonderry and New
   Hampshire are becoming (and in many areas already are) an Inspiration
   to other Towns and States……How Great Is That!

   The “Inspiration” part of this weeks “On The Road With Sherry” happened
   just yesterday. . .  Tim Beaton who moved into Londonderry not long
   after me as it turns out, in the early 70’s, called to ask if there was
   some way he could register to vote.  Now that sounds easy to most of
   us, but Tim was stricken at a young age with Multiple Sclerosis.

   Yesterday I had the honor of meeting Tim at his home and registering
   him to “Vote” for the first time.  I asked Tim why “now” with wanting
   to Register?  Tim said that through the years life got in the way… to
   busy… meant too… all those things that we all say about so many
   things.  I asked if he had children and he said no… he shared with me
   that his wife died very young of Lung Cancer.  He lost her in just 4
   short months from the day she was diagnosed.  No warning, no big signs
   early on. Tim went on to explain to me that Donald Trump “Inspired” him
   to Register to Vote!  How Great is That! Tim loves his track record in
   business turning things around, his Passion, his energy, and that his
   top goal is to make America Great Again!

   Mr. Trump inspired Tim, but Tim Beaton inspired me!  I so enjoyed our
   time together and I know we will be seeing each other again!  Here Tim
   is in this tough situation that would break most of us and he was one
   of the happiest, most grateful people I have met in a long time.  We
   talked about the Candidates, Londonderry and even my girls.

   On the way to Tim’s house I pulled into a place that I didn’t even know
   existed in Londonderry the “Leslie C. Bockes Memorial Forest”.  Tim
   told me that there are trails back there and many people hike our great
   woods from this location.  It had a nice safe parking area right on
   Mills Road.   Tim asked me to remind everyone that this beautiful trail
   is right there.

   You have to “Google” this Trail.  I just stopped typing to you because
   I had to learn more… Tim really got me thinking about it and honestly I
   would have just driven right by!

   We have another “Gold Mine” right in Londonderry!” The Google Site for
   this trail is beautiful.  Here’s what I learned….It was started by
   Reverend Leslie C. Bockes and her family.  She initially started it as
   a summer camp for inner city youth from Lowell, Massachusetts.   Now it
   is known as a Tri-Town Forest being shared by Londonderry, Hudson, and
   Windham.  There are 226 acres waiting for us!  The trail that many
   people already enjoy is a 3.6 mile loop from the parking area.  There
   is a beautiful sign posted with information to get you “headed in the
   right direction” I guess you could say.

   The logging road is considered an easy trail and is great for Horse
   Back Riding, Hiking, Snow Shoeing and Skiing. Remember this is just one
   of the many trails available in these Tri-Towns.

   I can’t believe I had no idea about this!  Thank You Tim!

   Now back to the “Politicking” part… In our house right now the 4 of us
   are loving every minute of living in our Great State where there could
   not be a better place to be during all of this “Politicking”.  We
   haven’t decided yet who we are going to support, but we are doing our
   very best to watch the debates on TV, attend, listen, and read the
   information that is out there.  We are proud to be “Independent Voters”
   or as we need to put on the State Registering to Vote form….
   “Undeclared”.

   In New Hampshire we don’t have a formal Independent party.  Maybe it’s
   time that changed… We want the best person for the Huge Undertaking at
   Hand whether they are Republican or Democrat in every office.

   Honestly I like to see how hard they are willing to work, how
   personable they are, and yes their background is important but if they
   have backbone and great listening skills they will be smart enough to
   surround themselves with specialist in each of the vital areas.
   President Regan and President Kennedy would be great examples of this
   in my book anyway.

   Well a couple weeks back John and I were coming out of our new found
   Bagel Place I told you about in Nashua.  It was one of our very early,
   unshowered, hoping no one would see us drives to the farmers market…
   Again.  As we walked into the shop “Outside” was standing Mike
   Broderick who is running for the position of Mayor of Nashua.

   Mike was so personable, friendly and sincere that we wanted to stop and
   learn more about him.  What an impressive guy!  He simply loves
   Nashua!  He was in our National Guard, he raised his family there; he
   started and owns his own business in Nashua over 30 years ago.

   John and I were “Inspired” by him!  Standing out there on his day off,
   handing out flyers, taking a chance, putting yourself out there….
   Politics are not easy and we all know how nasty they can get.  His
   Flyer says “As your experienced and committed Mayor, I will work for
   you to insure a better quality of life for you and your families”.  To
   me part of that means he wants to keep our young people and families
   here, too!

   Mr. Broderick had a great handshake, looked you in the eye with
   sincerity… and if we could vote he would have our vote on September 8th
   in Nashua.  Vote Broderick!  I know you won’t be disappointed.

   With a Grateful Heart for the “Gifts” of Our Great State, Londonderry,
   Meeting Tim, for good men and woman who are willing to stand up for
   what they believe in with Grace Under Pressure and for all of
   you….especially “Wayne” and his gift of words.

   Happy Happy Birthday to Me “55” Today xoxoxoxo

     * [258]Steve Homsey: LOL, Want’s to control everybody. What do you
       think your party is / does? Control women, basically anyone who
       does not share the same belief’s as you etc. Either that or...
     * [259]Ken McLoon: Typical Liberal. Wants to control everybody.
       Anyone have any idea why on this web site, my laptop is fine, but
       my Surface Pro flashes on and off? This does not happen on any
       other site,...
     * [260]steve homsey: Not to pick a fight (but who am i kidding). I`d
       change the ordinance to put every Republican in town on a leash and
       let the dogs roam free.
     * [261]Martin Srugis: According to the conservation committee goal of
       “10 minute walk to 10 acres.” It seem to me you have plenty of area
       for your dogs to run and do their business!;-)
     * [262]MIke Davis: I see what you did there. I’m digging the sarcasm.
       Aren’t extremists fun!
     * [263]Steve Homsey: That’s brings up another point. My dog is on a
       100Ft Rope, so he is free to roam around the back yard, run, lying
       in the Sun, do business, whatever. People who walk their dogs...
     * [264]MIke Davis: Reading these comments it amazes me what people
       will complain about. God forbid you have to walk your dog with a
       leash! Or you are no longer allowed to just let your dog out the
       back...
     * [265]Tom: The dog ordinance was on the agenda for the April 4th
       town council meeting. If Boles asked at the meeting, he was asking
       for something that was already in the works. There was no
       discussion of...
     * [266]B Himes: Curtis Boles came before the TC on April 4 to ask the
       council to ask for a law prohibiting dogs in the cemetery because
       he saw tracks(dog?) there in December. Now he walked passed the
       sign...
     * [267]Tom: The Londonderry Town Council will hold a PUBLIC HEARING
       on the following item: 1.) Ordinance #2016-02 – An Amendment to the
       Municipal Code, Title I, Chapter XXIX, Dogs The Public Hearing
       is...
     * [268]Bill P: Dog owners: Pay attention to the agenda for the Town
       Council meeting when this comes up again, attend and voice your
       concerns there. Venting is comments is one thing but voicing
       your...
     * [269]Steve: I walk my dog off leash all of the time because he’s a
       high energy dog and running is good for him. Whoever filed that new
       ordinance must really hate dogs!
     * [270]Jim Loiselle: Dog Park – no way. It will end up just like the
       Skate Park. Dogs will hang out there – dog graffiti – smoke and
       drink – cause problems – leave trash...
     * [271]B Himes: Who presented this ordinance to the TC? It is
       ridiculously restricting to dog owners particularly in light of the
       town’s inability to find some space for a dog park. Also if I
       walk...
     * [272]Steve Homsey: What’s more troubling is: “creating disturbing
       noise within the Town of Londonderry at all times”. Yet those who
       live near the Musquash have had to endure may...
     * [273]MY2 CENTS: IT SEEMS THE TC DOES NOT HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO
       WITH THEIR TIME IN A CONSTRUCTIVE MANOR NOW THEY WANT TO BURDEN THE
       POLICE DEPT CHASING LOUD DOGS INSTEAD OF KEEPING AN EYE OUT FOR
       THE...
     * [274]Steve Homsey: Poor Programmed Reputards. PolitiFact rated
       Republican claims to be “false” or “pants on fire” three times more
       often than it rated Democratic claims that way...
     * [275]Ken McLoon: Martin, I won’t check anything Steve says. We all
       know his sources are skewed……
     * [276]martin srugis: Ken, don’t bother with Factcheck, they are a
       creature of the extreme left wing. They are used to intimdate
       voters. The Anneburg group who supports them is not the same
       group...
     * [277]Steve Homsey: Also Ken, Once again Factcheck. The absolute
       cure to Republicanism! “When broken down by the percentage
       increase, it is also clear that the growth in the per capita cost
       of...
