   You probably figured you’d heard every bad or crazy thing about the
   dysfunctions of the U.S. education system already. Particularly when it
   comes to wages. Teachers aren’t famous for the money they make. Which
   might make the tenacity of some a little surprising.

     After 20 years on the job, only 2 to 3 percent of teachers leave
     before retirement.

   The reason? Money. Yes, we’re still talking about teachers. For most
   professionals — lawyers, doctors, accountants, computer programmers —
   income peaks when people are in their 40s and then gently declines, on
   average. Take-home dollars might not go down, but income fails to keep
   pace with inflation. But where teachers are concerned, with a limited
   total salary pot, much is spent on rewarding older teachers closer to
   retirement, more than on attracting and retaining younger teachers,
   where turnover turns out to be much higher. They have to wait until way
   late in life, until their mid-fifties, to earn peak salaries.

   In fact, the numbers, put together by Marguerite Roza, director of the
   Edunomics Lab and research professor at Georgetown University, look
   pretty bleak. That’s not a bad thing, but in their first five years in
   the classroom, 13.5 percent of newbie teachers bail from the
   [164]profession. The impact is even worse than the raw numbers suggest.
   That’s because affluent school districts tend to attract the more
   experienced — and stable and higher paid teachers — meaning poorer
   districts experience higher teacher turnover and more instability, just
   when they need the opposite.

   Roza argues that, for the health of the profession, the salary curve
   should be flatter, but she figures that between teachers [165]unions
   and government regulations, redoing the whole salary system could prove
   to be mission impossible. A much easier fix, she says, would be to
   award equal-value cost-of-living increases to teachers, rather than
   percentage raises where most of the increase goes to the already higher
   paid teachers. The five-year value of COLA increases in New York in
   2013, for example, netted $25,014 for a teacher with five years’
   experience versus $41,542 for a teacher with 22 years’ experience.

   Since we’re talking about education, naturally, not everybody thinks
   this is a great idea. Lee Barrios, a retired teacher and education
   activist in Louisiana, figures the approach — paring back the incomes
   of experienced teachers — is upside down, in part because it violates
   an explicit deal in her state that teachers would accept low pay in
   exchange for decent [166]retirement benefits. “Teachers don’t teach for
   the money,” she says. Far more important in her view is to stop trying
   to turn education into a business and to strengthen tried-and-true
   community control.
