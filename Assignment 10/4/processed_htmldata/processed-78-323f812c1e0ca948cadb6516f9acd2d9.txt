[55]Brooklyn Man Sentenced In Subway Hammer Attacks

   Attacks
   [58]BREAKING NEWS, [59]Violent Crime February 8, 2016
   [INS: :INS]

   NEW YORK — A 30-year-old Brooklyn man was sentenced to 12 years in
   prison for two separate robberies of subway commuters. In each
   incident, the defendant approached from behind, struck the victim’s
   head with a hammer as the victim purchased a MetroCard, demanded money
   and fled the scene.
   [INS: :INS]

   District Attorney Thompson said, “In order for our city to be a place
   of law and order, people must be able to enter our subways without fear
   of being violently attacked. This defendant caused such fear by
   ambushing subway riders from behind, smashing them over their heads
   with a hammer and running off with their money. Without question, he
   now deserves to spend many years locked up in prison due to the
   extremely violent nature of his attacks.”

   The District Attorney identified the defendant as Anthony Coward, 30,
   of 159 Hull Street, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. He was sentenced
   today to 12 years in prison and five years’ post-release supervision
   following a guilty plea on January 25, 2015 to two counts of
   first-degree robbery, which represent the top counts of the indictment.

   The District Attorney said that, according to the investigation, both
   incidents took place inside the Rockaway Avenue subway station, which
   serves the A and C subway lines and is located at the corner of
   Rockaway Avenue and Fulton Street in Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.

   On May 4, 2014, at approximately 11 a.m., Cory Healy was purchasing a
   MetroCard from a vending machine when he was approached from behind and
   hit on the side of the head with a hammer by the defendant. The victim
   fell to the ground and the defendant demanded his property and
   continued to strike him with the hammer. The defendant then fled with
   the victim’s wallet, MetroCard, debit card and $58 in cash.

   On May 7, 2014, at approximately 9:20 a.m., Brijanand Rishianand was
   purchasing a MetroCard when he was hit in the side of the head with a
   hammer by the defendant. The victim, bleeding, gave the defendant $140
   and the defendant fled.

   Both victims suffered pain, bruising and swelling to the head. The
   first victim also suffered bruising to the arm, while the second also
   suffered a concussion.
