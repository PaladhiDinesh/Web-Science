Sanctuary City Fan to be Walmart Greeter at Border?

   By [32]Daniel John Sobieski

   Only in the fundamentally transformed America of President Obama could
   the former police chief of San Francisco, the city where [33]Kate
   Steinle was murdered by an illegal alien given sanctuary, and herself a
   supporter of sanctuary cities, be the short list for the next head of
   the U.S. Border Patrol. As [34]Fox News reports:

     A former San Francisco police chief and vocal supporter of a
     sanctuary cities policy is on a short list of candidates to become
     the new chief of the Border Patrol, according to sources.

     As police chief, Heather Fong shielded illegal immigrants, including
     aliens who committed crimes, from deportation. In contrast, it is
     the job of the U.S. Border Patrol to catch and deport all illegal
     immigrants, including those with a criminal history….

     During her five years as the chief of SFPD, Fong refused to
     cooperate with ICE, telling reporters in November 2008, "We do not
     cooperate with ICE when they go out for enforcement of immigration
     violations of the law."

     A few months earlier, she appeared in a public service campaign
     telling illegal immigrants they're welcome in the city. In promoting
     San Francisco's sanctuary city policy on TV, radio, posters and
     brochures in five languages, Fong said illegal immigrants had
     nothing to fear under her watch. "San Francisco is committed to
     providing safe access to public services to our communities," she
     said.

   Except for American citizens like Kate Steinle, the young lady shot by
   an illegal immigrant, Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez a seven-time felon
   who had been deported five times, only to return to San Francisco’s
   welcoming arms. In local custody, he was released by Sheriff Ross
   Mirkarimi, who thankfully was just thrown out by voters. Mirkarimi was
   implementing the [35]San Francisco policy of not notifying federal
   authorities of such releases. Heather Fong supports this policy
   wholeheartedly.

   Donald Trump got into trouble for saying our open borders policy allows
   Mexican criminals free access to the United States. Yet criminals do
   come like Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez do come across and Heather Fong
   as head of the Border Patrol would be unlikely to stem the tide. Rather
   she would be probably be standing on the border passing out a map of
   sanctuary cities.

   Being a sanctuary city is illegal. State and local authorities cannot
   refuse to enforce federal law. Of course, who is going to call
   sanctuary cities to account when the President of the United States
   refuses to enforce our immigration laws? As [36]Investor’s Business
   Daily noted in February, President Obama ordered those in charge of
   border security to obey his executive orders on amnesty and not our
   immigration laws:

     If President Obama, who has warned ICE agents of consequences if
     they do their job, had a son, he might look like Jamiel Shaw Jr., a
     young African-American killed by an illegal alien who shouldn't have
     been here.

     Shaw was a Los Angeles high school star dreaming of a good life
     ahead when he was gunned down on March 2, 2008, while walking home.
     He was picked at random, police said, possibly as part of a gang
     loyalty test for the illegal alien who shot him.

     The sanctuary policies that led to the murder of Shaw are now
     full-blown federal policies under Obama. "We're not in the business
     of deporting millions of people or of breaking up families," he
     says. We're also not in the business of deporting criminal illegal
     aliens….

     …President Obama was telling employees at Immigration and Customs
     Enforcement that they had better enforce his executive amnesty
     orders or else.

     Speaking at a Miami town hall meeting sponsored by MSNBC and
     Telemundo, Obama said "there may be (an) ICE official or Border
     Patrol agent not paying attention to our new directives. If
     somebody's working for ICE . . . and they don't follow the policy,
     there's going to be consequences to it."

   Thankfully, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals put the brakes on
   Obama’s executive amnesty when it ruled that we are indeed a nation of
   laws and not executive orders. As[37] Breitbart News reported:

     The Court ruled the lower court did not err in granting a temporary
     injunction blocking President Obama’s executive amnesty program.
     Federal Judge Andrew Hanen previously issued a temporary injunction
     stopping the president’s actions, as reported by Breitbart Texas.

     “The court’s decision is a vindication for the Rule of Law and the
     Constitution,” said Texas Governor Abbott in a statement obtained by
     Breitbart Texas. Abbott initially filed the lawsuit in 2014 during
     his final months as Texas’ Attorney General. “The President’s job is
     to enforce the immigration laws, not rewrite them. President Obama
     should abandon his lawless executive amnesty program and start
     enforcing the law today.”

   Despite the Fifth Circuit ruling, that remains an unlikely prospect.
   The chief of the Border Patrol does not require Congressional approval
   and appointing Heather Fong would be a way of President Obama striking
   back. Personnnel is policy, as they say. That Heather Fong is on the
   short list for Border Patrol chief should not surprise. It reflects
   President Obama’s contempt for the law and for the American people.
