All-Day Breakfast Drives McDonald’s Sales Surge
     __________________________________________________________________

   [125]All-Day Breakfast

   All-day Egg McMuffins helped break McDonald’s six-quarter sales slump,
   but breakfast is just part of the CEO’s plan.

   McDonald’s introduction of all-day breakfast is resonating with
   customers and it’s showing in both sales and stock prices. News of
   better-than-expected quarterly sales caught the attention of investors
   who helped the company’s shares rise 3% to reach a record-high of
   $121.90 in late January.

   The surge in sales after six quarters of stagnant numbers comes on the
   heels of the company’s introduction of a turnaround plan meant to help
   it better compete against the likes of Wendy’s, [126]Starbucks and
   Burger King. Those fast-food giants have focused on breakfast items
   while introducing other value options to entice customers through their
   doors.

   Seeing a gap in its offerings, McDonald’s new CEO Steve Easterbrook
   laid out a turnaround plan last year. One of the plan’s pillars was the
   October rollout of all-day breakfast items, such as the chain’s popular
   Egg McMuffins and hash browns. The rollout is credited with helping
   spark the company’s sales surge. U.S. restaurants open for at least 13
   months saw sales climb by a whopping 5.7% in 2015’s fourth quarter.
   Analysts had forecast average growth of only 2.7%.

     __________________________________________________________________

   While all-day breakfast is getting the credit for helping McDonald’s
   transform lackluster results into record-breaking stock prices, it’s
   not the only measure the company is pursuing to drive sales.
   Easterbrook, who has helmed the company for less than a year, has also
   switched the chain to antibiotic-free chickens, raised worker wages,
   lowered prices and simplified the menu. Plans are in the works to
   introduce cage-free eggs and speed up service. The company also
   recently introduced a McPick 2 for $2 value menu that includes such
   selections as the McChicken sandwich and the chain’s new mozzarella
   sticks.

   Change is in the air at McDonald’s, but some fear the bolstered numbers
   may be only temporary. QSR Magazine’s Editor in Chief Sam Oches
   recently questioned the sustainability of all-day breakfast as a
   driving force behind sales. Easterbrook doesn’t disagree.

   “All day breakfast is understandably more of a headline grabber,”
   [128]MarketWatch quoted Easterbrook as saying. “It will settle down a
   little from its launch phase, but we believe that building these other
   platforms of growth on top of that will keep us competitive in the
   marketplace.”

   Time will tell if that’s true. In the meantime, McDonald’s investors
   can take comfort in the fact that the turnaround plan has worked enough
   to break that six quarter streak of falling numbers.
