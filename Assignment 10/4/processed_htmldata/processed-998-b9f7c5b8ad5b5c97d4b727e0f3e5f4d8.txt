A Letter to My Two Year Old

   [13][20tnuv8.jpg]
   Dear baby boy,
   Where has the time gone? You're already over two and a half and are
   growing at a rapid pace. I notice it most in your clothes, in the ones
   I bought you months ago that were way too big and baggy at the time are
   now too small for you, particularly in length. How have you grown so
   much in just a few months? I also notice it in your weight. You're 2.5
   stone now and I can just about carry you for a few minutes up the road
   until my arms give way. I look at you and you are growing into a little
   boy!
   You still have your little chubby baby face though and are so kissable
   right now! You're still so baby-like in many ways. You burst into tears
   occasionally (and on some days a lot!) when you don't get your way,
   usually over something utterly trivial, like being given your red bowl
   instead of your purple one. You're still in nappies (potty training in
   progress) and you're still breastfeeding occasionally. You still have a
   huge appetite and will pretty much each anything. Although you're tall
   and lean you still have the cutest round little pot belly which is
   where all your food ends up!
   You are full of so much energy at the moment, I can't keep up. You love
   jumping on bouncy castles, in puddles, on the bed, on mummy, on the
   sofa and anything you can find with a slight bounce to it. You don't
   sit still for long and love running, wrestling, jumping, hopping,
   anything active! We went into the countryside a couple of days ago with
   your new boots on and I told you you could jump in as many puddles as
   you liked. You were in your element and absolutely loved it, running up
   to any puddle you could find and making a huge jump and splash. I had a
   smile on my face watching you with so much excitement.
   You can read all the numbers from 1-10 now. I was amazed when you
   learnt to do this a few months ago and you can point out numbers
   wherever we go. Naturally, I think you are a genius. And you are saying
   all sorts of words, phrases and sentences, like a little boy. I really
   love the way you pronounce certain words in your baby accent still
   though. Green is 'nee-nor', sheep are still 'baa baa' and train is
   still 'choo choo'. You've just learnt the difference between under and
   over and love saying 'the train is going over the bridge'. You've also
   leant to distinguish between the sexes incredibly well. How and when
   did you learn this?  You know if someone is a man, women, 'little girl'
   or 'little boy'. You call yourself 'a big boy' now even though you call
   other kids your own age 'babies'. You are a real chatterbox and can
   speak all day long! Except when other people are around. That's when
   you go all shy.
   I love all the activities we do together; swimming, painting, crafts
   and your recent favourite is cake baking! Most of the mixture gets
   eaten before it reaches the oven but you are my little sous chef!
   Drawing and painting are also high on your list and you're becoming
   more creative in your artwork. In the last few months you have been
   singing loads. You can sing the Alphabet, 'Old do-doddle' (Old
   MacDonald), Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Incy Wincy Spider and Baa Baa
   Black Sheep and you're so proud of yourself when you finish. Sometimes
   you applaud yourself, it's so funny! Occasionally, I change the words
   of the nursery rhymes and add silly words such as 'poop' which you find
   hilarious. Your favourite toys right now are Thomas the Tank Engine,
   your animal collection (particularly your elephant), your train set,
   Scout and your big red bus! You still love any vehicle just like you
   have done since you were a few months old.
   Your personality is developing all the time. You are a mixture of
   cheekiness and sweetness rolled into one big ball of energy. You've got
   the most beautiful smile. You're becoming more and more independent and
   will go downstairs and bring something up to me if I ask (usually toy
   related). You continue to be very strong willed & determined (possibly
   taken after your mummy) and you will happily pick out you favourite
   toys or clothes if I ask what they are. You love pulling funny faces to
   make me laugh, usually at times when I'm meant to be cross with you
   like when you throw your food on the floor. You're very affectionate
   still and will ask for a trillion 'cuddles' everyday. They usually
   consist of two seconds of a cuddle followed by some kind of wrestle or
   bouncing activity! In the last few months you said 'I love you' for the
   first time which had me in tears.
   I so appreciate all the time I get to spend with you and all the things
   we experience together. I try to do as much with you as possible, to
   take you places & teach you about the world and also just experience
   life from your perspective. I won't lie, the days can be truly
   exhausting but I wouldn't have it any other way. Two is the best age
   yet, full of fun, love and mischief!
   You are growing up faster than I would like but that is life I suppose.
   I love you forever and ever more.
   Mummy xxxx

       What a sweet sweet post. It is lovely to see them grow up, from
       little babies into big boys an girls. My daughter is the same age
       an I am constantly in awe at the rapid changes that happen and the
       personality that is shining through, stronger and stronger :)

            Thanks very much Sanna. They change so much! I started writing
            this post a couple of months ago but had to edit so much of it
            as he's stopped doing a lot of those older things and moved on
            to the new things he's learnt. Enjoy your precious time with
            your daughter, they are growing up so fast :) xx

       That's a lovely post. My son is at a similar age so I read with a
       wry smile your description of sweetness mixed with tears over the
       silliest things.

            Thanks very much, it really is nice to record his development.
            I've been doing it since he was a baby and he has grown so
            quickly. Ah, happy birthday to your boy. Let me know when you
            write the letter :) x

       This letter is so beautiful. Amazing that you have described so
       much about your sons character. It's crazy as when he is 18 you may
       forget what he was like, this letter will surely remind you! Thanks

            Thanks so much. It's true, I'm already forgetting bits here
            and there so these will be lovely to look back on when he's
            older :)

       He sounds very similar to my toddler with his love of singing,
       jumping in muddy puddles and chatting away in a cue accent. Your
       love for your little boy comes across in your writing so much.
