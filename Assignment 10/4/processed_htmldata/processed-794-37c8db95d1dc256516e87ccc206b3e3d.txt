[69]Being Moody: Who's the greatest living president?

   Atlantic City, New Jersey (CNN)Walk along Oriental Avenue here near the
   inlet, and there's a fair chance you'll hear the sound of classical
   piano music coming from inside an old brick house that stands alone
   near the hulking shadow of the now-shuttered Revel casino.
   The home, an aging but well-kept relic of Atlantic City's once-thriving
   past, is owned by 68-year-old Charlie Birnbaum, who has worked as a
   piano tuner for local casinos for more than 30 years.
   Since 2012, his property has been the target of a state agency that
   aims to use eminent domain to demolish his three-story property to
   build a yet-to-be-announced tourism village the state says will
   revitalize the economically struggling area.

   The state has put up $238,500 for the property, but Birnbaum refuses to
   give it up until a court orders him out. And has been fighting for
   three years to keep it.
   While New Jersey's Casino Reinvestment Development Authority (CRDA) has
   a general plan for the neighborhood's revitalization, it has not stated
   specifically how Birnbaum's property will be used, a fact on which
   Birnbaum has made his stand.

   "For three years I've been asking, if you're going to take these
   memories from me, what are you going to put here? And the answer I got
   is, 'We don't know yet,'" Birnbaum told CNN. "That's not good enough
   for me."
   The battle raises serious questions about the appropriate use of
   eminent domain, in which a state or federal government pays to seize
   property from a private owner for public use, a power that is enshrined
   -- but restricted -- in the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
   It comes as the 10th anniversary approaches of the landmark Kelo U.S.
   Supreme Court decision, in which the court controversially allowed the
   city of New London, Connecticut, to use eminent domain to tear down an
   entire neighborhood as part of a plan to benefit Pfizer, a
   pharmaceutical company.

Kelo

   Today, the city of New London still has done nothing with the land and
   all of the homes there have been removed. The decision sparked a wave
   of eminent domain reform laws that strengthened property owners' rights
   in 44 states, but as time passes, advocates worry that memory of Kelo's
   impact is slipping away.
   "That is absolutely a fear, and it's something we see happening," said
   Robert McNamara, an attorney from the libertarian nonprofit Institute
   for Justice, which represents Birnbaum. "In the immediate aftermath of
   Kelo, you saw a lot of local government officials and developers
   realize they had been caught with their hand in the cookie jar. They
   realized that suddenly people were watching. Ten years on you are
   starting to see in a number of states, local government officials and
   developers start to look at that cookie jar again."
   [70]Being Moody: Inside the battle for Latino voters
   In 2011, the New Jersey state Legislature passed a law granting the
   CRDA to clear and build a space that would support the much-anticipated
   Revel Hotel and Casino, a towering $2.4 billion structure on the north
   end of the city's boardwalk that, at the time, represented new hope for
   the struggling city. The investment didn't pay off.
   By 2014, the Revel and three other major Atlantic City casinos shut
   down. This year, an investor bought up the property for a fraction of
   the cost, but the casino's future still remains uncertain.
   The success of the project reflects on Gov. Chris Christie, who
   supported a set of tax incentives to encourage the Revel's investors
   not to give up on construction in 2011.
   Christie has not spoken about Birnbaum's fight with the state, but when
   asked whether he believed eminent domain could be justified to take
   property from one private owner and give it to another private owner,
   he suggested the practice was justified depending on the facts of the
   case.
   "It depends upon the circumstances. That is what eminent domain is all
   about, that's why we have the ability for people to go to court and
   work through that," Christie said during a recent visit to New
   Hampshire, where he is building support for a possible future
   presidential campaign. "I can't give a generalized answer on that. A
   generalized answer is just sophomoric and I won't give one."
   The CRDA declined an interview with CNN, but said in a statement that
   it is still making development plans for the area.
   In November, a Superior Court judge ruled in favor of the state, saying
   that the CRDA had authority to seize the property by paying a fair
   market price. The judge has still not responded to a motion to
   reconsider the ruling filed by Birnbaum's attorney, which has allowed
   him to remain there for the time being.

A 'refuge'

   Birnbaum's parents were Holocaust survivors who met while hiding in the
   forests of Poland. Both of their prior spouses had been killed by the
   Nazis. They fled to an American-controlled part of Germany, where
   Charlie Birnbaum was born in 1947, and eventually made it to the United
   States.
   The family had a talent for music, so they moved to Pennsylvania to
   study piano, where Birnbaum, a prodigy, played a concerto in the
   Philadelphia Orchestra at age 11. When their Philadelphia home was
   condemned, they moved out of the city, a decision Birnbaum said sparked
   symptoms of depression for his mother. As an undergraduate, he suffered
   a breakdown that led to a failed suicide attempt.
   Seeking greener pastures, the family moved to the home near the beach
   in Atlantic City.
   "This represented heaven to them. It lifted their spirits," Birnbaum
   said, looking toward the ocean from the home's living room. "This
   represented ownership in the greatest country in the world."
   Birnbaum used the home as a place to take care of his aging parents.
   Charlie's father died in 1988. Ten years later, his mother and a
   caretaker were beaten to death by a drug addict inside the home.
   "For 10 years, mom lived with a sense of independence," Birnbaum said.
   "We were able to create some quality of life. And that's the memory
   that far outweighs what happened here in that terrible moment."
   [71]Being Moody: This question stumps Republicans
   Since that time, Birnbaum, who lives with his wife in nearby Hammonton,
   has relied on the property as the base of his piano-tuning business to
   house his tools, and for rest between shifts. (CRDA's attorney has
   pointed to the fact that he doesn't live in the home as partial
   justification for the eminent domain.) But Birnbaum said that it
   doesn't matter whether he lives in it or not.
   "People all their life are looking for a special place to be. Well, I
   have it in this place," he said. "I may lose it, it may be gone next
   year, but I'm going to be able to sleep at night saying I didn't just
   let them bulldoze it without a fight. And that's something that's going
   to be with me until the day I'm gone."
   Despite Revel's failure, the CRDA still moved ahead with plans to seize
   land for the project.
   Until then, and until the legal process sorts out, Birnbaum still has
   access to the house, where he will remain playing his Yamaha baby grand
   piano.
   "I want to see it come up," Birnbaum said of the city's revitalization.
   "I don't want to be pushed out and then have it come up like a flower.
   I want to be part of it."
