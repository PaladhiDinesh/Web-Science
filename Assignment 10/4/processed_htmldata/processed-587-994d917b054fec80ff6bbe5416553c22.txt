   Published on Feb 1, 2016

   We first predicted that Marco Rubio would be the Republican Nominee
   last summer. While still in third place nationally, there are more
   reasons than ever to believe that Rubio can defeat Donald Trump in the
   GOP primaries. Rubio has more key endorsements, a much higher net
   favorability rating, and it appears the establishment has chosen him to
   take on Donald Trump. Though Trump will win many early primaries, by
   early March the GOP field will be down to essentially 3 candidates.
   Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, & Marco Rubio. Look for Rubio to dominate after
   March 15th, especially in the highly valuable winner take all states,
   such as Florida. There's also a great chance to see a brokered
   convention if no candidate gets enough delegates to secure the
   nomination. This also plays in Rubio's favor. With John Kasich as Vice
   President, the Rubio/Kasich ticket would be strong in both Florida and
   Ohio, giving the GOP their best chance to win the general election.
