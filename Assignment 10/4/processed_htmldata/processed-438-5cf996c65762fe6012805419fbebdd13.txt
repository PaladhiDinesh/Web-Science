UW-W Walmart Athletes of the Week

   For the week of February 1 - 7, 2016:

   MEN'S BASKETBALL
   15921

   [114]Trinson White (Milwaukee, Wis./Riverside), Senior, Forward
   White averaged 21.0 points, 8.0 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game last
   week to help the Warhawks move up to a tie for fourth place in the WIAC
   standings. He tallied a game-high 23 points on 7-of-11 shooting from
   the floor and 7-of-8 at the free-throw line and grabbed seven rebounds
   as UW-Whitewater finished a season sweep of UW-Stevens Point with a
   72-51 victory on the road last Wednesday. Three days later, White
   posted 19 points, including 14 in the second half, and added nine
   rebounds and four assists against first-place UW-La Crosse at Kachel
   Gymnasium.

   WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
   15732

   [115]Abbie Reeves (Salem/Westosha Central), Senior, Guard
   Reeves recorded 17.5 points and 3.0 rebounds per game and shot 12-of-21
   (57.1 percent) from the floor to help the No. 15 Warhawks split a pair
   of games last week. She tallied a game-high 23 points on 9-of-14
   shooting to help UW-Whitewater to a 73-55 victory at UW-La Crosse on
   Saturday. Reeves finished with 12 points and hit 5-of-5 at the
   free-throw line Wednesday against 16th-ranked UW-Stevens Point. Over

   16061

   Specialist
   [116]Mackenzie Smith (Milwaukee, Wis./Martin Luther), Junior

   which tied for the 11th best mark in program history, to help the
   Warhawks defeat Gustavus Adolphus (Minn.) 189.100-178.750 on Saturday
   at Russell Arena. Her performance helped UW-Whitewater post a
   season-high score on the bars of 48.100, the No. 3 score in the school
   record book. Smith's consistency on the bars over the last two weeks –
   she also registered a 9.725 at Division I Southeast Missouri State on

   9.508
   16067 All-Around

   Pickett matched her season high score with a 38.100, the 19th-best
   score in school history, to win the all-around competition and help the
   Warhawks defeat Gustavus Adolphus (Minn.) 189.100-178.750 in a dual
   meet Saturday at Russell Arena. She won both the balance beam (9.600)
   and the floor exercise (9.575), finished third on the vault (9.475) and
   placed fifth on the uneven parallel bars (9.450). Pickett's tally on
   the bars helped UW-Whitewater post a season-best 48.100, the third-best
   score in the event in program history.

   Invitational on Saturday at UW-Stevens Point. His long jump mark of

   Starnes ran a career-best time of 7.10 in the 60 preliminary race and
