   WASHINGTON, Feb. 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- [291]Trump International
   Hotel, Washington, D.C. will open in September 2016 dramatically ahead
   of schedule.  With its opening, the Nation's Capital will now be home
   to an iconic and historic super-luxury hotel rivaling the best of other
   international capital cities.

   "For decades people have looked in wonderment at the magnificence of
   the Old Post Office building and structure. There is nothing like it
   and we are so proud to have not only brought this incredible building
   back to life, but also to a position far greater than it ever was at
   its previous zenith. It was an honor to have dealt with the
   professionals at the General Services Administration.  It was their
   total passion and hard work that helped bring this unrivaled project to
   fruition," says Donald J. Trump.

   "It has been an incredible journey transforming the Old Post Office
   into what will be the finest luxury hotel in the country—if not the
   world.  We have worked tirelessly to meticulously restore one of the
   United States' most high profile landmarks and are incredibly proud to
   unveil the results of our efforts this September," says Ivanka Trump.
   "Under our agreement with the U.S. government's General Services
   Administration (GSA), the hotel was scheduled to be completed by August
   of 2018, but through our team's hard work and close collaboration with
   the GSA, we will now be opening almost two years ahead of schedule,
   which is unheard of for a project of this size and complexity.  In
   addition to the incredible professionals at the GSA, we are thankful
   for the tremendous support given to the project by Congresswoman
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, Mayor Muriel Bowser, Chief of Police Cathy
   Lanier and the numerous other civic, federal and city officials who
   have supported and contributed to the project including the National
   Capital Planning Commission, D.C. Historic Preservation Office,
   Commission of Fine Arts and the National Park Service."

   "After the more than a decade of work it took to get our bill
   authorizing this project out of the Congress, I am the first to
   appreciate that D.C. residents and visitors will be happy to begin
   enjoying this historic landmark ahead of schedule, and that both the
   federal and D.C. governments will begin receiving revenue from this
   high-value site in 2016 instead of 2018," said Congresswoman Norton.

   With its prestigious location right on Pennsylvania Avenue, the U.S.
   Government has entrusted the Trump Organization with the complex
   challenge of transforming this 19^th century one-of-a-kind building
   into one of the greatest luxury hotels in the world.   Painstakingly
   restoring the intricate stonework, original wood milling and paneling
   while installing the latest in technology and luxurious comforts
   expected by today's sophisticated and discerning travelers, the hotel
   will introduce to the market 263 exquisitely detailed and spacious
   guest rooms and suites.  The thirty-five suites include the Trump
   Townhouse with its private entrance on Pennsylvania Avenue.  At 6,300
   square feet of interior space, it will be the largest and most
   luxurious suite in Washington, D.C. and among the largest in the
   country.

   Recognizing the need for a luxury ballroom spacious enough to host
   larger International meetings and opulent enough for prominent city
   galas, the Trump Organization designed a complementing addition to the
   main building.  With a private entrance, the 13,200 square foot,
   column-free Presidential Ballroom will be the largest luxury ballroom
   in Washington, D.C. and has already been enthusiastically received by
   wedding and event planners, major associations, and corporations.

   "This is my fifth hotel opening and I can say with conviction that I
   have never seen so much interest and so many early bookings as I have
   at Trump D.C.; we already have a significant number of events confirmed
   for 2016 and beyond with many more inquiries being considered," said
   Mickael Damelincourt, Managing Director of Trump International Hotel,
   Washington, D.C. "We are preparing for what is a highly anticipated
   opening, and one that is unique to Washington, D.C. and the country as
   a whole."
