Big names back Trump tower

Soros, Deutsche Bank said to be in on 90-story building

   October 28, 2004|By Thomas A. Corfman, Tribune staff reporter.

   Donald Trump has lined up three New York hedge funds, including money
   from billionaire George Soros, to invest $160 million in his Chicago
   skyscraper, a key piece in perhaps the largest construction financing
   in the city's history, according to real estate sources and public
   documents.

   Despite reports about the project's record-breaking sales, most of them
   from Trump himself, many Chicago real estate developers and lenders
   have expressed doubts about whether the 90-story tower would ever be
   built.

   "It is such a huge project, and the prices he said he was getting were
   so outside the norm," said Robert Glickman, president and chief
   executive of Chicago-based Corus Bank.

   "It was reasonable to say, `Is this real?'" he said.

   Much of the skepticism springs from Trump's own hype. "Chicago
   developers are much less flamboyant," said Glickman.

   The massive financing, which sources say also will include a $650
   million construction loan from Deutsche Bank, should quell those
   doubts.

   Trump flies to Chicago Thursday morning for a ceremonial demolition of
   the former home of the Chicago Sun-Times, 401 N. Wabash Ave., which
   will be replaced by his 2.5 million-square-foot tower. The demolition
   is expected to begin for real in January.

   On Wednesday Trump declined to comment on the financing, emphasizing
   instead the luxury project's record-breaking sales.

   The chief executive of New York-based Trump Organization said he has
   agreements to sell three-fourths of the 461 condominiums and 227
   hotel-condo units for a combined $515 million.

   "Nobody to my knowledge anywhere in the United States has ever sold
   more than $500 million worth of apartments prior to construction," he
   said. "It's a great tribute to Chicago, to the location and to a great
   design.

   "And, I guess, to Trump, when you think of it," he added.

   The investor trio is led by Fortress Investment Group LLC, according to
   a financing statement filed Oct. 19 with the Cook County recorder's
   office.

   Fortress, which manages more than $10 billion in investments, is
   familiar with the downtown Chicago condominium market after providing a
   key $26 million loan on the River East mixed-use development last year.

   The document does not identify the other participants, but a key member
   is Grove Capital LLP, according to sources familiar with the
   transaction.

   The firm manages most of the multibillion-dollar real estate portfolio
   of the $13 billion Soros Fund Management, from which Grove Capital was
   spun off last month.

   The third investor is Blackacre Institutional Capital Management LLC,
   the real estate arm of hedge fund Cerberus Capital Management LP, which
   manages assets totaling $14 billion.

   Executives with the three hedge funds could not be reached for comment.

   The $160 million investment is in the form of a mezzanine loan, a kind
   of second mortgage that typically charges a much higher interest rate
   than a first-mortgage construction loan.

   Unlike the mezzanine loan, which has closed, terms of the $650 million
   construction loan have not yet been finalized, sources said.

   Frankfurt, Germany-based Deutsche Bank, an active commercial real
   estate lender in the U.S., is expected to split up the loan with other
   banks.

   Chicago developer Steven Fifield admits he was a "total skeptic" about
   the project, which initially included a large portion of office space.

   But the elimination of the office space and the steadily climbing condo
   sales helped change Fifield's view about Trump's chances to get
   financing.

   "I thought it was a given with the number of presales he had," said
   Fifield, president of Fifield Cos.

   After 13 months of marketing, condo prices at Trump International Hotel
   & Tower Chicago have exceeded $900 a square foot, while hotel-condo
   units cost nearly $1,100 a square foot, according to an analysis of 53
   units by Appraisal Research Counselors, a residential consulting firm.

   Trump's marketing firm recently put those units, including six
   hotel-condo units, on the Multiple Listing Service of Northern
   Illinois.

   Almost two weeks ago Trump completed a buyout of his former joint
   venture partner in the project, Hollinger International Inc., the
   troubled parent of the Sun-Times.

   Although lining up the financing was a big step for Trump, he still has
   hurdles to overcome, including avoiding construction delays and cost
   overruns.

   Still, he expressed no concern about the doubts harbored by some local
   real estate executives.

   "It's a very expensive building to build because of the quality we are
   putting into it," he said. "So people of course would say, `Gee, that's
   a lot of money to raise.'

   "But for me, it's not a lot of money. You understand," he said.
