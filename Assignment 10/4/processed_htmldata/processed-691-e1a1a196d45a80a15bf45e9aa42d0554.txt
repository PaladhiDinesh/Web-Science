Rubio braces for attacks in debate, and Trump returns to the stage

Rubio appears to be gaining steam following his strong third-place finish in
Iowa

   February 6, 2016 10:30AM ET

   [44]Marco Rubio headed into the latest Republican debate ready for an
   onslaught of attacks about his experience and preparedness from a trio
   of rivals whose performance in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday
   will be critical to [45]their White House hopes.

   [46]Donald Trump also was rejoining his competitors in the debate arena
   Saturday night after having skipped the previous faceoff in Iowa. He
   finished second in the Iowa caucuses and has spent the past week
   complaining bitterly about the result.

   While Iowa shook Trump's grip on the Republican field, he has led New
   Hampshire preference polls for months and the state is still seen as
   his to lose in Tuesday's voting. However, Rubio appears to be gaining
   steam following his stronger-than-expected third-place finish in Iowa,
   drawing big crowds across New Hampshire — as well as a flurry of
   criticism from other contenders who say the first-term Florida senator
   lacks accomplishments.

   "He's a great guy, but he's not a leader," said former Florida Gov. Jeb
   Bush. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has repeatedly derided Rubio as a
   "bubble boy" whose staff protects him from having to answer tough
   questions about his record and what he would do as president.

   Bush, Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich have largely staked their
   presidential hopes on New Hampshire. Those falling short of a standout
   finish in New Hampshire will face party pressure to quit the race,
   particularly if Rubio has another strong night.

   Bush in particular has struggled in many of the previous GOP debates.
   While many of his rivals spent Saturday huddled in debate preparations,
   Bush spoke to an overflow crowd in Bedford, where he thanked people for
   asking substantive questions.

   "The questions on the debate stage will probably be really stupid," he
   said. "I'm not very optimistic."

   Rubio and the trio of current and former governors are fighting to
   emerge as the more mainstream alternative to Trump and Texas Sen. Ted
   Cruz, the fiery conservative who won Iowa. Cruz is so loathed by GOP
   leaders that some have openly said they would rather see Trump win the
   nomination despite his inflammatory comments and sometimes erratic
   behavior.

   For Cruz, New Hampshire is less of a natural fit than Iowa, where he
   had strong support from the state's many evangelical voters. Still, he
   sees an opportunity for a strong showing that could send him into the
   coming Southern primaries in a commanding position.

   The Republican field was for months a large and unwieldly collection of
   candidates seeking to put the party back in the White House for the
   first time in eight years. But the pack has already started to narrow
   following the Iowa caucuses, with Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul and Rick
   Santorum all ending their campaigns.

   Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson is fighting to avoid joining that
   group. After a disappointing showing in Iowa, he took time off from
   campaigning and hasn't been a major presence in New Hampshire this
   week.

   With fewer candidates, debate host ABC News scrapped an undercard
   debate for low-polling hopefuls. But their rules for the main event
   left businesswoman Carly Fiorina as the only candidate without a spot
   on stage.

   Fiorina, the only Republican woman running for president, has protested
   her exclusion, and party leaders such as 2012 presidential nominee Mitt
   Romney have come to her defense.
