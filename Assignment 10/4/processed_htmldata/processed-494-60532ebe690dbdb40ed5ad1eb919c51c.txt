Your smartphone or camera + my insider secrets = Money for you!

   [me-on-beach.jpg]

   Hi, I'm Michael Davis and I'm the founder of Get Paid Taking Pictures.

   This story may sound bizarre, but it's actually 100% true.

   You're about to hear how a snapshot I took of some guy in a
   parking lot changed my life forever...

   And keep in mind that I have zero photography experience!
   [heading-27.jpg]

   Up until last year, I was just a Walmart drone who was barely scraping
   by on minimum wage.

   But, one day at work this guy wanted me to take a picture of him in the
   Walmart parking lot.

   It was another sucky day at work. I was on a break and texting my
   girlfriend from the parking lot. This guy came up to me. He said he
   needed some help. He wanted me to use his iPhone to take a picture of
   him walking to his car with a shopping bag in his hands. Kinda weird,
   right?

This is the parking lot where it all started...

   When I asked him why, he told me that he got paid by big companies to
   upload photos of people doing everyday stuff – like going shopping,
   eating fast food, even just walking down the street. He said he made a
   living taking these pics and uploading them to special sites on the
   web.

   I went online to check out the site he'd told me about. I was pretty
   sure it would be totally bogus. But I tried it anyway.

   So, I uploaded a few pictures that I already had on my phone. Then,
   since I had the 6 a.m. shift in the morning, I went to bed and didn't
   really think anything about it until the next day.
   [heading-29b.jpg]

   That next day, after I put on my lame Walmart uniform, I went back to
   that site. What?! I couldn't believe it really worked! I had made more
   in one night than I could make all week at Walmart.

   I went to work and my shift seemed to last f-o-r-e-v-e-r! I couldn't
   wait to get home.

   When I finally got home and checked again, I discovered I had made
   $234.79 more!
   [heading-30.jpg]

   That's when the light bulb went on. That guy may have been a weirdo,
   but he was a genius!

   After some more research, I discovered there was a massive untapped
   industry that was ready to explode ... and nobody seemed to know about
   it!

   There are multi-million dollar companies who want to pay for everyday
   pictures.

So, I began snapping pictures of everything I saw...

   I got out my old iPhone and started snapping lot of pictures of: balls,
   grass, the sky, bricks, people, buildings, cups, straws, water – you
   name it and I took a picture of it!
   [heading-48.jpg]

   As more money rolled in every day, I realized it was decision time:
   Keep working for $80 a day for Walmart or make $500+ a day taking and
   uploading pictures.

   Duh! It was a no brainer! Now, I just upload everyday ordinary pictures
   to these special sites and get paid over and over again. And, the best
   part is that the more a picture is used, the more you get paid.

   That was important - because I have exactly zero photography
   experience... unless taking pictures at your brother's bachelor party
   counts.

   I'm just an ordinary guy with no experience who is cashing in on this
   untapped market. The great news is there's still plenty of time for you
   to get in on the ground floor and ride this wave for years to come.
   [heading-33.jpg]

   Why am I telling you all this? Well, that guy in the Walmart parking
   lot helped change my life, so now I'm doing my best to pay it forward.
   I have taken the initial information that I learned in the Walmart
   parking lot and have ramped it up 10 fold with all of the things that I
   have learned.

   Since so few people know about this opportunity, the demand is at an
   all-time high. That means there is no better time to start getting paid
   for your pictures than now ... but you have to know how to do it the
   right way.
