       We’re honestly not doing much. Our wedding anniversary was last
       week so we went out to dinner for that. My husband is working today
       and we have a family birthday party so it’s really just another
       Sunday.

       We always have a goal to do nothing for Vday! We’re too old for
       that hype. Today we went out for breakfast and hit the grocery
       store together. Practical and still spending time together!

       Valentines Day falls in a Sunday, so church, dinner and the return
       of The Walking Dead is my family’s plan.

       We used to go out for Valentine’s day, but after years of dealing
       with the long lines and huge crowds, we have been having dinner at
       home, which has been nice too.

       We don’t plan on doing anything unusual. A few days before or after
       the 14th, we might go out to dinner. But we’ll leave the crowded
       date to newer couples…
