For #OneNYC, a call for a Utica Ave. subway amidst competing interests

   By [13]Benjamin Kabak
   [14]The Utica Ave. subway extension, a proposal from New York City's
   history, has reappeared in the OneNY document.

   The Utica Ave. subway extension, a proposal from New York City’s
   history, has reappeared in the OneNY document.

   A bunch of years ago, then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg released his
   comprehensive plan for New York City’s immediate future. Awkwardly
   called PlaNYC, it introduced the city to the idea of a congestion
   pricing charge for Manhattan’s Central Business District and tied in
   the revenue from this fee to transit upgrades designed to secure the
   city’s environmental future while cutting down on crippling congestion.
   The centerpiece failed, but the overall master plan concept has stuck
   around. It was refreshed four years ago and overhauled this year as
   Mayor Bill de Blasio released OneNYC on Wednesday.

   The idea behind OneNYC is similar to PlaNYC but with de Blasio’s
   imprint. It is concerned with raising New Yorkers out of poverty while
   paying nod to growth, sustainability and resilience. While politicians
   sometimes hate to admit it, all four of these goals are focused around
   mobility, and transit necessarily has to grab the spotlight. In his
   OneNYC report [[15]pdf], de Blasio doesn’t mention congestion pricing
   or the Move New York plan. In fact, he later claimed, perhaps to save
   political capital in the face of a recalcitrant governor, that he’s
   never read the Move New York proposal. But de Blasio did turn his
   attention to transit.

   “Reliable and convenient transit access to employment and other
   activities remains stubbornly out of reach for too many New Yorkers.
   This problem is particularly acute for low- and moderate-income
   residents in areas poorly served by the subway or buses. For seniors
   and those with disabilities, this can affect their ability to simply
   get groceries, or see family and friends,” the report notes.

   To correct these problems, the Mayor’s Office offers up some familiar
   solutions. The report discusses the new citywide ferry network that
   won’t actually correct the problems, and it again reiterates plans to
   bring 20 new Select Bus Service routes to the city within the next
   three years. Where things get interesting though is with the MTA’s
   unfunded capital plan. The OneNYC report says the city will “support
   full funding of the MTA capital plan.” The report dances around direct
   fiscal support though and states that “the City will also work closely
   with the MTA to identify significant savings and improve operational
   coordination in areas of common interest, such as bus rapid transit,
   other bus services, and Access-a-Ride. Any savings we achieve together
   can be leveraged to create new capital support for the MTA.”

   In exchange for this support, the city wants something. They always do.
   In this instance, the city proposes the bombshell: a study of a subway
   down Utica Ave. in Brooklyn. The report calls for faster CBTC adoption,
   new or reopened entrances that are ADA-compliant, randomly a free
   transfer between the Livonia Ave./Junius St. L and 3 stations, and
   subway-fication of the LIRR between Jamaica and Atlantic Ave. after
   East Side Access opens. But the Utica Ave. line is the centerpiece.

   The document doesn’t go too far here. The mayor wants simply “a study
   to explore the expansion of the subway system south along Utica Avenue
   in Brooklyn, one of the densest areas of the city without direct access
   to the subway,” and on its face, it’s exciting that someone in City
   Hall is talking about this idea in an official document. It is so far
   unclear how a Utica Ave. subway would take shape. It could involve an
   extension of the 4 train from the Eastern Parkway line. It could call
   back to Second System plans to run trains from 2nd Ave. through South
   4th St. and, eventually, down Utica Ave. But there you have it.

   As The Times [16]noted, this is far from the first time this idea has
   arisen. A Utica Ave. subway was part of the early 1900s plans for the
   subway and were included in expansion plans in the 1920s, 1930s and
   1960s. Another study today seems like overkill, but it’s the first step
   toward securing funding. It’s a very preliminary first step though.

   In discussing this idea, the transit cognoscenti were surprised. “No
   one expected this,” the Rudin Center’s Mitchell Moss said to The Times.
   “It’s refreshing to see a proposal to extend mass transit into areas of
   Brooklyn that are transit-deprived. It’s obviously an idea that will
   take more than a decade to be carried out, but you have to start with
   an idea.”

   The challenges being right there. One of the reasons why politicians
   are so hesitant to embrace these ambitious plans concerns timing. If
   it’s going to take a decade or more from start to finish, those who
   appear at the ribbon cutting won’t be those who did the heavy lifting
   and secured the dollars. There is no political incentive to push
   through infrastructure projects if the only photo op will be a staged
   event 18 months before the real opening date (cough cough [17]7 line
   extension cough cough).

   But there are other challenges too. The next concerns money. Who’s
   funding this subway extension? How? The last concerns priorities. The
   MTA has its own capital program wishlist and a 20-year needs
   assessment. The Utica Ave. subway featured on none of those documents,
   and adding it to the capital plan means more money would be required
   and more demands made. The MTA has identified the [18]Second Ave.
   Subway as a need; the Mayor wants Outer Borough support and has plans
   for Utica Ave. It’s a push and pull that gets resolved through money.

   So that’s the plan for One New York. A Utica Ave. subway would be
   intriguing, but without a new and dedicated East River tunnel, it would
   create more a capacity problem on whichever line the extension would be
   a part of. It faces many, many challenges, but it’s a start. At least
   someone’s talking about it.

       It may seem random but let’s look at the most recent major
       transportation expansion plan… from 1968. In it were proposed the
       2nd Ave Subway (to the Bronx as well), Queens Superexpress with
       Archer Ave and LIE Subways, relocating the L through Canarsie, the
       Utica Ave Subway and the extension of the Nostrand Ave Subway.
       The 2nd Ave Subway is in the report as well, to finish Phase 2 and
       get Phase 3 going. The Queens Superexpress is arguably more needed
       than Utica Ave or Nostrand Ave but it serves an area of the city
       that already has both subways and LIRR. CBTC can help the Queens
       Blvd Line for a fraction of the cost than building a new express
       subway. Also it can’t really work to its full potential until SAS
       Phase 3 opens… lord knows when that happens.
       While both Nostrand Ave Extension and L train relocation would help
       they don’t serve new areas.
       What this means is that the Utica Ave Subway can easily be
       connected to the existing network without too much issue AND it
       serves an area of the city with no other access to the subway.
       Also, where is de Blasio’s new affordable housing push going to be?
       East New York and, by extension, Flatbush. The Utica Ave Subway is
       something that can push his affordable housing agenda, be
       operational quickly, and open up an area of the city that has no
       train options. That’s why he chose it.

       I feel like this is mostly just lip service to the idea of serious
       transit expansion and will never actually happen. With costs
       through the roof it is difficult to politically justify a new
       subway line that only serves a small subset of the city. Note that
       all post-Moses era subway expansions have either been in Manhattan
       (7 extension, SAS) or serving the ability of large areas to get to
       Manhattan (63rd St tunnels, Archer Ave – both benefiting the huge
       swaths of Queens and Long Island).
       Then you also have the NIMBY factor. Subwayless neighborhoods are
       usually lower density than areas right near the subway, and the
       residents of such neighborhoods usually like their lower density
       and don’t want any transit improvements that would inevitably
       change that. To the credit of the people forming this plan, East
       Flatbush is one of the few places you could expand the subway into
       new territory without massive resistance from people along its
       planned route.
       That said, I do wonder why Utica Ave is getting attention over
       simply extending the Nostrand Ave route – which presumably would be
       less expensive since you don’t have to build a new junction, and
       the existing terminal was designed to be temporary with further
       extension in mind from the getgo. Might as well fulfil its destiny
       100+ years later. That and extend the 7 past Flushing-Main, which
       is woefully underdesigned for the traffic it serves and was also
       never intended to be a permanent terminal.

            To be fair the Nostrand Ave Subway does need the Rogers Ave
            junction rebuilt.

                 I’ve never understood why “The 96th Street Solution”
                 wasn’t and isn’t applied to Rogers Avenue. The conflict
                 between expresses and locals crossing north of 96th
                 Street and Broadway was solved, not by rebuilding the
                 junction, but rather by sending all the locals up
                 Broadway and all the expresses over to Lenox. And it
                 works just fine.
                 If the 2 and 3 went to Flatbush Avenue, while the 4 and 5
                 went to Utica/New Lots, there would be no need to
                 rebuild. Wy would hanging trains at Franklin be more of a
                 burden than changing trains at 96th Street?

                      Probably a combination of ridership demand and
                      keeping the 2 and 5 trains scheduled together so
                      they reach the Bronx as close to on schedule as
                      possible.

                      My recollection from years ago, when I hung out on
                      the Straphangers Campaign forum, is that they wanted
                      to preserve one-seat rides to both the East Side and
                      West Side of Manhattan. I don’t remember who “they”
                      are – could be the MTA, could be the local
                      communities. But it’s a deliberate strategy. Witness
                      how the 3 and 4 used to go to Flatbush and the 2 and
                      5 to New Lots, but then they were switched.

                           That’s probably why absurdly inefficient
                           service patterns such as those on CPW and at
                           Gold St. Junction in Brooklyn persist. Sooner
                           or later though we will have to move away from
                           them.
                           What was the riding public’s reaction to the 96
                           St change? How long did it take them to get
                           over it?

                                If you have access to the NY Times
                                archives, check out “Modernized IRT to Bow
                                on Feb. 6” from Jan 26, 1959.
                                “Under the new set-up, all trains
                                originating on the upper West Side
                                (Broadway line) will travel down the
                                westernmost tracks as what the Authority
                                calls Hi-Speed locals to South Ferry.”
                                The article goes on to explain that these
                                are “Hi-Speed” locals because the line is
                                getting new trains and accelerate and
                                decelerate faster than the current trains.
                                The better trains enable the schedule on
                                the local to match the speed of the old
                                express schedule. PLUS, the article notes
                                that 91st St is being closed. They could
                                argue that it’s both faster and local?
                                It’s a good way to spin it.
                                The article also notes that some trains on
                                the Broadway line will bypass 191st,
                                181st, 157th, and 145th, but only for one
                                single hour in the peak direction each
                                day. I guess that’s the origin of the
                                stupid 1 and 9 skip-stop arrangement?
                                Local service below 96th St would increase
                                by 92% (!) and express service by 6%.
                                So not only was everyone getting more
                                service, but I guess by giving upper
                                Broadway customers an upper Broadway
                                “express” during the height of rush hour
                                they were mitigating the “loss” of being
                                now on the local (which was just as fast
                                as the old express) below 96th as well.
                                The IRT knew what they were doing.

                                     Oh, and to compare to today:
                                     They give an example where the
                                     “Hi-Speed locals” were to match the

                                     minutes from 242nd and Broadway to
                                     14th St.
                                     This takes about 43 minutes,
                                     according to current schedules.

                                     essentially what they did was promise
                                     faster service and ignore the outcry

                                     The line to Utica/New Lots would be

                           Gotta get away from that idea of prioritizing
                           one-seat rides over efficient routing. In an
                           era of crowded trains that (SHOULD!) run very
                           frequently, it shouldn’t be too much of a
                           burden for people to do a simple cross-platform
                           transfer.

                      The switch layout at Rogers Junction does not allow
                      “the 96th Street Solution” to work smoothly because
                      trains on the express tracks can only switch to the
                      local before the split or at Utica. This means there
                      are only two real options to eliminate conflicts
                      there:
                      1) Run only the 2 to Flatbush, run the 4 and 5
                      express to Utica, and the 3 local to New Lots
                      2) Run the 2 and 3 to Flatbush, run the 4 and 5 to
                      New Lots, close the Nostrand Ave and Kingston Ave
                      stations since they’d have no service.
                      Option 1 I don’t think is viable since with the need
                      to sanitize trains at Utica I don’t think it can
                      handle the combined rush hour frequency of both the
                      4 and 5 terminating there. You’d need to short turn
                      a bunch of 5s at Bowling Green or still send a bunch
                      of them to Flatbush. So this doesn’t offer better
                      service.
                      Option 2… well, involves closing 2 stations so
                      that’s not viable either.
                      Although building new platforms for the express
                      tracks at Nostrand and Kingston might be easier than
                      rebuilding the junction.

                           Instead, create a new track way so the local
                           from Franklin goes straight to Flatbush
                           (creating a third track). This would free track
                           space for the 4 to run to new lots without
                           interfering with the local track space and the
                           5 to run express to Utica. From Flatbush, the
                           track would mesh with the local after the
                           switch for eastern parkway local with express.
                           Creating these 3 track areas should be fairly
                           cheap compared to many other ideas of relieving
                           congestion.

                                Even simpler than that, a switch could
                                just be added from express to local just
                                after the Flatbush line splits off (and

                                     I agree that this is the easiest

                                     The point is that the junction limits
                                     capacity by having trains crossing at
                                     grade.
                                     Sending all Lex service to Jerome and
                                     all 7 Av service to WPR is likely to

                                     it would be more reasonable to
                                     maintain a Dyre-Lex service running
                                     ~8tph, with an equivalent amount of
                                     service running to 148th.

                                     Brooklynite hit the nail on the head.
                                     After the 4 & 5 pass the junction,
                                     one of them crosses over to the local

            A cheaper solution to the Utica Avenue subway line would be to
            extend the Nostrand Avenue Line under Flatbush Avenue to Kings
            Plaza. This will not require a building of a new junction, but
            would require the demolition and relocation of some of the
            Flatbush Avenue station entrances, an addition of a second
            elevator at Flatbush Avenue station, and the building of a
            third track at Rogers Junction to free capacity. In fact, an
            extension of the Nostrand Avenue Line would result in a better
            increase of ridership than the building of the Utica Avenue
            subway line.
            However, there are two major disruptions that can potentially
            occur during construction:
            1. At least 26 consecutive weekend shutdowns are required to
            upgrade Rogers Junction and the line’s signal system. During
            this time, 2 and 4 trains would have to operate to New Lots
            Avenue and shuttle buses would replace trains between Franklin
            Avenue and Flatbush Avenue. 3 train service would have to turn
            around at 34th Street-Penn Station.
            2. With Flatbush Avenue station having side platforms, one
            platform and one track would have to be closed at a time. The
            station would only be served by 2 trains during construction;
            5 trains would have to terminate at Bowling Green until
            construction on the extension is substantially complete.
            Initially, the Nostrand Avenue Line extension would contain
            only one station at Avenue U-Kings Plaza, which would be
            designed and constructed with hurricane and earthquake safety
            in mind (it would be constructed to withstand a major
            hurricane or earthquake). Station shells at Flatlands
            Avenue/Kings Highway and Quentin Road/Avenue R would also be
            built instead of stations at those locations to reduce initial
            construction costs.

            That would be about $500 million per kilometer – very high
            given that it’s an outbound extension, but nowhere near the
            outrage that is SAS.
            It would also be reasonably cheap per rider (my guess for
            Utica ridership is 200,000 per weekday).

       What the MTA needs to do to get cars off the streets of NYC are
       projects that create advantages over driving into the city. First,
       better park and rides. Set up mega car garages at the
       Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, George Washington Bridge, Holland Tunnel,
       and Lincoln Tunnel at NJ toll booths and charge at least half of
       toll cost to cross the Hudson via express bus to major subway
       stations in NYC. Second, start charging tolls per footprint of
       vehicles. The larger the footprint, the higher the toll. Third,
       give discounts to vehicles with more passengers. i.e. $1 discount
       per additional one person after the driver up to three ($3). Forth,
       in addition to finishing the Eastside Access Project so LIRR trains
       can stop at Grand Central, expand the LIRR through Brooklyn into
       the new Fulton Street Station. That way Downtown Long Islanders
       wouldn’t have to use the subway to get to Wall Street. Lastly,
       expand PATH and NJRR into Grand Central or at least Times Square.
       Another big issue is cross town movement. I have to use buses on
       57th Street everyday to cross from the Eastside to the Westside and
       back again. The traffic is horrible and slow. I have noticed when
       cops are directing intersections the commute goes smoother. Need
       more specialize traffic cops who can direct traffic, give out
       parking, and moving violations. Drives get away with too much. They
       ride and park in bus lanes, block the square, and stop three cars
       length in front of the next. Drivers need to become more aware of
       their surroundings and the effect they have on traffic around them.
       I’ve seen drives part so far from the next car and/or not stay in
       their lane that a whole block can not move until they move. We need
       a herd of traffic cops storming block by block giving tickets. We
       also need to make new violations like stoping in the middle of two
       lanes and stopping more than a half a car in front of the next.
       Taxi stands are also needed in high traffic areas. No random corner
       or half lane stoping for those who can afford the taxi fare. If you
       can’t walk a forth of a block from the taxi stand the passenger
       needs a disability or medicare card to stop any other place beside
       the taxi stands. Taxi drivers need special traffic efficiency
       training and certification to keep their license.
       Good luck passing those measures,

            Another idea is for the City and State employees to vary their
            work start and end times in 15 minute increments. And
            encourage private businesses to do the same. Instead of
            everyone coming to work on the hour, they can come in 1 of 4
            different times in that same hour. This will help traffic with
            3/4 of people not having to commute at the same time with the
            other 1/4. This will help street and mass transit decrease
            their gridlock hours.

                 The toll is $5.54. The proposal is to charge $4.54 for
                 two people. If this would get cars off the streets, the
                 stated goal, then the alternative is two separate cars
                 with one person and tolls of $5.54 each.
                 So $11.08 vs $4.54. Today it’s $11.08 vs $5.54. Or for
                 three people $16.62 vs $3.54, compared with $16.62 vs
                 $5.54 today. You get most of the savings already anyway.

       The Utica Ave. line seemed to crash and burn in the past partly due
       to the geology of southeastern Brooklyn, where planners said the
       high water table would mandate an elevated line at the southern
       end, if the route was presumably going to extend all the way to
       Flatbush Avenue.
       New methods of elevated construction such as the Silver line in
       Falls Church limit the noise impact and tighten the footprint of
       the els between stations (though as the recent blizzards have
       shown, century-old box girder els do have their advantages in
       letting snow pass through to the street). But given the
       democratization of NIMBYism over the past 45 years since the MTA’s
       battle over the Heckscher Playground, it would be nice to know if
       de Blasio’s plan mirrors the el provision for Utica Avenue — which
       will likely bring the NIMBYs out in droves — or if it plans to defy
       the underground soil and water difficulties there and plow a
       water-pump-filled subway all the way to the southern terminus, with
       its higher construction and future M&O costs.

       How about first doing something about construction costs (labor

       costs are not risibly more expensive than those of other developed

       Look at all of the metro lines Paris plans to construct for the

            going to be able to magically bring in new contractors that
            can do this work.

                 That argument goes both ways. If there is only one
                 competent contractor, well, there’s only a handful of
                 legitimate transit agencies also. If contractor proposes
                 pricing, the MTA need not agree. Contractors need work.

       The 86th Street SBS is crazy. Yes, the bus line is crowded, but on
       an already congested street, taking out a lane each way will be a
       disaster.

            86th St. is no different from streets all over that have
            survived with dedicated bus lanes. New Yorkers really need to
            get over themselves with regards to bus lanes (and stop

            They’re not taking any lanes for M86 SBS. It’s the only SBS
            upgrade without any dedicated lanes, or even fewer stops IIRC.
            It’s really a win-win proposition, and I hope they duplicate
            it on the other cross-park lines.

            No, taking out a lane will vastly increase the capacity of the
            street, because dozens of people can fit in a bus compared to
            1.3 in the average car. This effect may even reduce congestion
            in the remaining lane.
            (Removing the parking lane, while keeping the two lanes in
            each direction, would have the same effect.)

                 Could we all agree to stop manipulating the definitions
                 of words in this way?
                 Vehicular capacity isn’t the same thing as passenger
                 capacity isn’t the same thing as occupancy rates isn’t
                 the same thing as vehicular capacity utilization. They’re
                 related, not the same.
                 To be clear: vehicular capacity goes down when you switch
                 out a general traffic lane for a bus lane because buses
                 are larger and typically cannot break as fast. This means
                 that the minimum safe headway between two buses is going
                 to be larger than between two standard cars and, in turn,
                 that you might only be able to fit 900 buses in a lane
                 that could have carried 1500 cars. Vehicular capacity
                 utilization goes WAY down because the entire point of a
                 bus lane is to have free flowing bus traffic which is
                 mutually exclusive with having a bus passing by every 4.5
                 seconds. (Having a bus go by every 4.5 seconds also
                 presumably means that none of those buses are stopping,
                 again, defeating the purpose of the bus lane unless it’s
                 the XBL in the Lincoln Tunnel or something like that.)
                 That doesn’t necessarily mean that passenger capacity
                 goes down. It also doesn’t mean that passenger throughput
                 goes down. And it definitely doesn’t mean that a bus lane
                 is or would be a bad idea.
                 All it means is that the absolute maximum number of
                 vehicles that can be carried by the road does, in fact,
                 go down.
                 (By the way, 1.3 isn’t the capacity of the average car.
                 The typical mid-size standard automobile seats 5 and
                 therefore has a capacity of 5. Across this vehicle class,
                 typical occupancy is 1.59.)

                      “Vehicular capacity isn’t the same thing as
                      passenger capacity”
                      Yes, and if you want to help people rather than
                      cars, passenger capacity is what matters.
                      “a lane that could have carried 1500 cars”
                      Except that traffic engineers will tell you that
                      non-freeway lanes carry a maximum of 1000 cars per
                      hour, and less if it’s congested like this street
                      is. Of course, the bus lane will handle fewer buses
                      than this, but it will handle dozens of times as
                      many passengers overall.
                      “The typical mid-size standard automobile seats 5
                      and therefore has a capacity of 5. Across this
                      vehicle class, typical occupancy is 1.59.”
                      Those extra seats are besides the point if nobody is
                      using them. Average occupancy for commute trips,
                      which are concentrated at peak congestion times, is
                      1.1. So 1.3 is a reasonable estimate of the
                      occupancy that has to be designed for.

                           Again, the entire point was to stop using
                           “capacity” when you really mean something else.
                           A bus every 8 seconds that just goes from one
                           end of 86 to the other making no stops at any
                           point has the most capacity of any possible
                           lane assignment and would be a fairly useless
                           exercise in absurdity.
                           Occupancy rates/passenger throughput, service
                           levels (which actually go down as capacity
                           utilization go up), and time in travel are the
                           figures you actually want to build your
                           argument for a bus lane around. Not “capacity,”
                           which is nebulous, arbitrary, and frequently
                           misdefined – that this country pretends the
                           other four seats in a midsize sedan either
                           don’t exist or are meant for carrying your
                           material possessions doesn’t change the fact
                           that those four seats are there. The 5-person
                           capacity of a single-occupant vehicle is a
                           fact.
                           As an aside, figuring a typical vehicle travel
                           speed of 7 m/s (just over 15 mph), vehicle
                           length of 4 meters, breaking deceleration of
                           2.5 m/s, a brick wall stop, and 1.5 second
                           reaction time, we can find that the capacity of
                           a congested surface lane moving vehicles at an
                           average of 15 mph or so is in fact 1457,
                           rounded down. To get a maximum of 1000, vehicle
                           travel speed must fall to an average of 6 mph.
                           Personally, I think 15 mph is reasonable,
                           appropriate, and a great target for average
                           speed of passenger vehicles on a surface street
                           in a pedestrian heavy urban environment. Do you

                                15mph is a reasonable speed, but it is not

       The subway-fication of the LIRR between Jamaica and Atlantic Ave
       should be viewed as major. The currently planned 30 minute interval
       cushy seat but high priced plan for a LIRR Jamaica shuttle is a
       waste of an already built resource and the price and lack of
       frequency will deter ridership. That subway-fication of this line
       was not part of the ESA package speaks volumes of the failures of
       our transit planning.
       Subway-ficationIt will provide frequent express fast service to the
       Flatbush hub, providing Queens riders with a faster trip to
       downtown Brooklyn and connections to most of Brooklyn and Wall
       Street.
       Obviously this line should be extended across the river to
       Manhattan but for now at almost no cost, converting this line to
       self contained subway shuttle would be a major plus.
       Naturally the long term goal should be to bring this line into
       downtown and then either uptown to out to Hoboken and Secaucus.

            tracks at Barclays, providing access to Lower Manhattan (and

            say JFK (Jamaica) to Lower Manhattan? But I couldn’t figure
            out the geometry around Barclays and whether adding a flyover
            connection there would be sufficiently cheap. Anyone know if
            this is possible?

                 That’s a good idea, although it would be quite an
                 imbalance to have trains fly from Rosedale to Jamaica to
                 Atlantic Terminal and then crawl along the R route into

                 encroach on active tracks and we all know how competent

                 There is no practical way to tie the LIRR tracks into
                 anything without abandoning the current terminal.
                 Even if you abandon the current terminal, any solution
                 will be very complex, expensive, and disruptive, given
                 the very tight vertical spacing of the tracks.
                 Making things even more complex in the last few years,
                 the last of the large empty lots in the area are now
                 built over or in process of construction, meaning that
                 all work would have to fit in the footprint of existing
                 streets that already have tracks under them.

                      tracks that have trains that are already filled with
                      people….

                      There’s nothing under Atlantic east of Flatbush
                      preventing the construction of a new transition to a
                      deep tunnel. There’s nothing under Atlantic west of
                      4th Ave preventing a new tunnel from being built
                      then. The only thing you have to negotiate are the
                      subway lines crossing Atlantic at angles. They go
                      down fairly deep, yes, but given that cut-and-cover
                      subway construction is no longer politically viable
                      it hardly matters.

                      According to this map, the LIRR tracks are on the
                      same level as the IRT tracks, and one pair of LIRR
                      tracks extends almost to the beginning of Ashland
                      Place. So all that would be needed for a R-LIRR
                      connection would be to dig up <200 meters of Ashland
                      Place and install connecting tracks of that length.
                      Doesn't sound too hard, and Ashland is not exactly a
                      center of NIMBY focus.

                           It’s probably possible if they cared enough to,
                           but it would be very tricky given that Ashland
                           Place contains the current D/N/R tracks
                           already. The B/Q run under St Felix St, which
                           is midway between Ashland and Ft Greene Pl,
                           further complicating things.

                                I was thinking they just have to dig down
                                and remove the roof of the D/N/R tracks,
                                add two switches to the sides of the R
                                tracks, and connect them up to Atlantic
                                Terminal. It looks to me like the vertical
                                rise here should be manageable. Since they
                                would be approaching the D/N/R from above,
                                no special measures or service
                                interruptions should be needed. And the
                                B/Q is a block away and should be
                                completely unaffected.

                                     The D/N/B/Q trains keep running like
                                     normal. The R trains are interrupted
                                     for a couple days and a number of
                                     late nights while you install the
                                     track connections. The trains that
                                     then run-through will take up unused
                                     space on the Broadway line.

                                     There are likely utilities above the
                                     D/N/R tunnel, placed there precisely
                                     because of its existence. Moving them
                                     would probably require going under
                                     both sets of tunnels. Long story
                                     short it’s possible, but would be
                                     difficult and disruptive given how
                                     ineptly some other projects in the

                                     Although I just noticed that the
                                     41st/10th subway stop, if it’s ever
                                     built, is projected to cost $450
                                     million (see Wikipedia). This R-LIRR
                                     idea seems about equally hard (or
                                     easy). And half a billion dollars to
                                     *temporarily* avoid an Atlantic
                                     Avenue transfer (until a new tunnel
                                     connects LIRR to Lower Manhattan and
                                     NJ) does not seem worth it.

                                     1- When you have tunnels that are
                                     using half their capacity making use
                                     of the rest of the capacity will have
                                     minimal detriment to the current
                                     users.
                                     2- Do not make this about Long
                                     Islanders vs city residents – if you
                                     get riders off the LIRR mainline at
                                     Jamaica, then maybe more reasonable
                                     pricing can be implemented to allow
                                     Queens riders to use that capacity
                                     into the Manhattan
                                     3- Many of the riders from Jamaica to
                                     Wall Street will be Queens residents
                                     – it is not about serving Long
                                     Islanders, but rather about making
                                     use of an available resource of
                                     maximal benefit.

                                     map for once, and you’ll see that
                                     DeKalb Ave has six tracks, and one
                                     pair is currently used only by the R,
                                     and the R only uses half of its track
                                     capacity. So nobody would be
                                     inconvenienced by this proposed
                                     connection. On the contrary, R riders
                                     would be better off, with twice as
                                     many trains running on the Lower

            If they do this, they definitely need to connect it with the
            Rockaway Beach Branch south of Atlantic Ave. Its less of a
            NIMBY-land than the rest of the line, and would solve the

                 downtown brooklyn. You can already take a subway from the
                 airtrain station to downtown brooklyn. The LIRR line, at
                 times just a block away, is faster. But will it still be
                 much faster if you are adding infill stations as part of
                 the subwayification of the line? And do those rockaway
                 trains come at the expense of trains from Jamaica?

                      That’s the point, the speed. The A train takes way
                      too long to get to the Rockways and this would
                      address the problem. They might add stations but
                      quite frankly there’s a limit to the number of
                      stations they can add due to the construction of the
                      line.
                      And I don’t see how they need to take trains away
                      from Jamaica. I really don’t see the need for the
                      Jamaica-Atlantic line to be anywhere near capacity.

                           To cut run time to the Rockaways why not create
                           a bypass from the Belt parkway to Pitkin Avenue
                           along conduit blvd. Replace the 5 bypassed
                           stations with one at Cross Bay Blvd. Such
                           routing would save travel distance and would
                           feed into the 4 track subway avoiding the the
                           merge onto the old fulton El and could be built
                           economically (if there is such a thing in NYC)
                           as a surface running line given Conduit Blvd’s
                           wide center median. This would benefit both
                           Rockaway and JFK riders. This bypass would
                           remove or lessens the need for either a
                           connection to the Atlantic Ave or the Queens
                           Blvd IND.
                           While subwayfication of the LIRR Atlantic
                           Avenue has great potential, it removes the
                           potential of a railroad extension from Flatbush
                           Ave to Hoboken via downtown. Such an extension
                           would have numerous benefits including:
                           *downtown service from NJ, LI, and if junction
                           is built, to the Bronx/Westchester/Ct
                           *giving the the Northeast Corridor an
                           alternate/emergency route.
                           Perhaps a better idea is subwayfication between
                           East NY and Jamaica with subway trains
                           transitioning at East NY onto the IND Fulton
                           Subway and/or the BMT Broadway (brooklyn) el.
                           The railroad would use Atlantic Ave to East NY
                           and then connect onto the freight line
                           providing service to Jamaica and point north
                           via Hellgate.

                           There is no train from Jamaica to downtown
                           Brooklyn. There is a train from Rockaway to
                           downtown Brooklyn. I had thought your comment
                           was in response to Eric’s that the line be
                           hooked into the Montague street tunnel, it’s
                           kind of hard to see how comments are threaded
                           on this site sometimes. In which case you’d
                           already be splitting capacity of the line with
                           Bay Ridge. If you split it again to give the
                           Rockaways a faster express service how many
                           trains would you have left for Jamaica? If the
                           trains would dead end at atlantic, then
                           capacity probably wouldn’t be an issue any time
                           soon, you’re right.
                           Scheduled run time from East NY to Atlantic is
                           ~22 mph on the LIRR. If stations are added
                           you’d probably have a similar run time from
                           East new york to woodhaven junction. From
                           Broadway junction to Jay st is 21 mph on the A.
                           It’s slower at ~20.5 mph on the section from
                           Broadway junction to Rockaway blvd. How much
                           time do you actually save? Beach 60th st is ~15
                           miles from Atlantic terminal. Unless you run
                           trains non stop from Howard beach to Atlantic
                           terminal you won’t meaningfully change things
                           for Rockaway riders.
                           Coming from Jamaica you save Brooklyn bound
                           riders a transfer and close to ten minutes of
                           time on the train, most of whom probably took a
                           bus or LIRR train to get to the new subway in
                           the first place. (or ~30-35 minutes over the F
                           through Manhattan.) Maybe that goes down to 7-8
                           minutes if you add a couple stops, I would
                           think at least at Woodhaven.
                           Why do you think stops couldn’t be added to the
                           line? Even if you can’t on Atlantic they should
                           add one at 101st on the elevated if they
                           reactivate that section of the RBB.

            On the east end of the line, the Rosedale branch of the LIRR
            should also be subway-ified. A subway line with less than 10
            stops from Rosedale to Atlantic Terminal, then continuing to
            Lower Manhattan via either Montague or a new tunnel, would be
            successful.

       While I commend the mayor for shifting the focus towards the

       being considered for a subway.
       The MTA removed the Third Avenue El is the 70’s. NYC Planning has
       already paved the way for the surrounding area to be rebuilt to a
       greater level than its historic density. So why not bring back an
       El. It would seem that an El could be built directly above the
       Harlem Line with relative ease.

       The other obvious option is a line that would cover Ogden &
       University Avenues in the West Bronx. The density already exists to
       support it. Consider the fact the (1) the 4 train is over capacity
       (2) The mayor wants to construct more housing along the Jerome
       Avenue corridor (3) The majority or households in this area are
       low-income and heavily reliant on public transportation.

            Or alternatively, to build a line on Third Avenue, to Bronx
            Zoo and then taking over the Dyre Ave branch (the 5). That’s
            also an underserved area. Then the frequency of the 4 train

                 I agree that Third Ave should come before any
                 neighborhood west of the 4 in the Bronx. The SAS should
                 eventually be extended along Third Ave in the Bronx.
                 To relive the 4 build a Metro North station at Depot Pl,
                 reduce fares within city limits and designate SBS buses

                 I disagree, the West Bronx is as dense as Upper Manhattan
                 and the Third Ave corridor is under built right now.
                 Significant potential for redevelopment with fast trips
                 to Midtown. Yes the area is being built up now but
                 there’s tons of one story industrial/commercial space,
                 lots and parking lots that could be redeveloped very
                 dense in that area with little resistance.
                 I wouldn’t build a subway west of the 4 right now though.
                 Instead I would build a Metro North station at Depot Pl
                 to serve Highbridge and drop the fares within city
                 limits.

       As far as who is paying for this – why not the City? Bloomberg
       smartly decided that he wanted 7 Train extension and opened the
       city’s pocketbook to pay for it.
       De Blassio despite the media’s view is a very cunning politician
       In the fight for Pre K education in NYC De Blassio set a marker of
       universal Pre K paid by increase taxes on the wealthy – He ended up
       with universal Pre K. Everyone thought De Blasso had failed because
       he didn’t get the rich to pay for Pre K but in fact he pushed a
       major education initiative through.
       MY Point? Right now NYC government has an anemic funding commitment
       in next MTA capital plan. I would bet De Blassio is positioning
       additional funding from NYC for MTA capital plan for this outer

       If the mayor’s goal was to expand subways in the other boroughs
       with relatively low overhead and quick turnaround time, then he
       should be (and should have always been) advocating the revival of
       the abandoned portion of the LIRR’s Rockaway Branch for subway
       service. Likewise he could ask the same for the LIRR’s [224]Lower
       Montauk Branch. And in line with his ‘subway-ification’ of the
       LIRR’s Atlantic Branch, he should describe how the underutilized
       LIRR branches of south Jamaica could tap into it.
       However if de Blasio’s goal is get publicity by making empty
       promises that pander to local supporters in a bid to position
       himself as the ‘Progressive Kingmaker’ of the 2016 Presidential
       Election, who will anoint Hillary like the Prophet Samuel, then by
       all means he should just pitch a [225]subway to Staten Island.

            If a plan to actually build a subway tunnel to Staten Island,
            (whether from the 4th Avenue line as your map illustrates
            (that was the 1920s plan); or a cross harbor tunnel to
            Whitehall) was actually proposed by a Mayor or Governor, they
            would pretty instantly become the most popular person on
            Staten Island.
            We wouldn’t hear publicly from a lot of them, because the
            complainers here on Staten Island are always louder, but
            anyone with a brain here knows the only real solution to the
            horrendous commute that islanders have to other parts of the
            city is a subway connection.
            If build like your map shows, it should continue all the way
            down the North Shore along the old rail right of way that
            exists. We would still need to vastly improve transit along
            the center of the island (Victory Blvd), a connection to the
            4th Avenue line would be awesome.
            In fact, I’m about to go to Manhattan, and I’ll drive to the
            36th St. D, N, R station. It would be great to just drive over
            to Tompkinsville and hop on an extension of the N train there.
