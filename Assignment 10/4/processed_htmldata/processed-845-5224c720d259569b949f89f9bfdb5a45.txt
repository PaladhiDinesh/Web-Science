Donald Trump’s Latest Venture: Retail Politics

   Donald Trump began his first event of the day in New Hampshire by
   admitting it was unusual territory for him.

   “I thought this was just a tiny little venue with a few people going to
   be here,” the real estate mogul said to an intimate gathering of people
   in Salem.

   “Sit down. Are you able to sit down?” he said, apparently unaware if
   there was enough space in the room for everyone to have chairs. “This
   is a little bit different. We crammed a lot of people into this venue,
   eh?”

   It was different. While normally Trump addresses audiences of thousands
   from behind a podium, Monday morning’s event was more of the true town
   hall style of retail politics. Trump held a microphone in the center of
   the room, sans lectern, surrounded by a few hundred people crammed onto
   temporary chairs.

   He spoke for about two minutes before he began the question and answer
   format, but during the course of the hour he spent in the room, he only
   vaguely answered many of the specific questions before pivoting to his
   usual speech material.

   Trump’s first question of the day was about what he would do to expand
   national service opportunities.

   “We’re going to look at it very seriously,” he said, before criticizing
   President Obama for not doing anything on that issue. (That’s not
   entirely true: Obama has [89]a mixed record on his campaign promises on
   national service programs, but he did expand the Senior Corps and
   create an “artists corps” program, among other things.)

   Another questioner said his granddaughter had just been born, and asked
   Trump if he could promise she would grow up safe and receive equal pay.

   “She will be so safe. She will be so safe,” Trump said, before
   launching into his talking points on border security, the Syrian
   migrants, his vote against the Iraq war, and the need to treat
   America’s veterans with more respect.

   On college debt, Trump said, ““I’m going to look into colleges. … We’re
   going to do something with regard to really smart financing.”

   And when a 13-year-old boy asked him what he would do about the
   national debt, Trump replied, “We’re going to make our country strong,
   we’re going to do some great things. Don’t worry about it, just go to
   school, get an education.”

   Although when one voter from Greenwich, Connecticut, asked him if he’d
   be able to “look [Syrian migrant] children in the face and tell them
   they can’t go to school here,” Trump was quick and clear with his
   response.

   “I can look in their face and say they can’t come here,” he said.

   Trump’s forays into smaller, town hall settings in New Hampshire are
   evidence of how his team is refining its ground game after a surprising
   loss in Iowa.

   Despite the fact that it’s the final day before the primary, Trump
   declined to criticize most of his Republican opponents besides former
   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.

   “If he weren’t in government you wouldn’t hire him to do anything,”
   Trump said of Bush, also saying “he’s like a spoiled child” and that
   he’s “not smart.”

   Many members of the audience said they had already made up their minds
   about how they will cast their votes Tuesday night.

   A veteran who stood up to ask a question said it wasn’t really a
   question at all: “I’d like to make some statements of facts here as to
   why you must be President of the United States,” he began. “I’d vote 10
   times if I could.”

   “I’m going to follow you around the United States for six months, put
   my business aside,” said another man in the audience who was from
   Boston, and said he’d been a fan of Trump since the 1980s.

   Later, a woman echoed the veteran: “I agree with the gentleman in the
   corner, if I could vote 10 times, I would,” she said.

   “That’s a minimal number you know, for some people,” Trump joked.

   After the event, as supporters filed out and Trump exited, one fan
   jumped up and down with excitement: “I got a selfie, I got a selfie!”
