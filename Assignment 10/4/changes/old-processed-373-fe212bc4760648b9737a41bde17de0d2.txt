       So far so good, the snow has just started falling. Supposed to be
       miserable today, freezing rain, rain, snow ‚Äì just wish we could
       have had a winter period. It is odd to know its February and to
       look outside and see the grass is odd. We usually have snow up to
       our first floor windows by now. So many ski areas and winter
       sporting shops are hurting this year.

       It is way too cold here! I mean, it is about 10 degrees Fahrenheit
       & the wind chill is below zero. Winter has got to go!

       alot of crocheting to pass the time, I am so glad I did not need to
       go out in the cold today.

       I‚Äôve been reading some of the other posts here about the freezing
       weather & last night I started watching a new crime series on BBC4.
       Set in Iceland, with amazing scenery but awful wintry conditions, I
       shall never complain of being cold ever again! Other than that just
       Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day everyone!

       Today is Valentines day, it is grey and drizzly, but me and the
       hubby are having a great day, going out to eat tomorrow (it is our
       49th anniversary) and way to crowded to go out to eat on Valentines
       Day.

       Well, it‚Äôs snowing again. That means no school tomorrow, so that
       means kids here by 7 a.m. Right now, all 3 (niece & nephews) are
       here while their Mom & Dad go to a funeral, so I guess my day could
       best be described as noisy!

       My day has been horrible, it was 15 below all night and the furnace
       stopped working around 4 am. The repair man came around 2 pm and
       had to thaw the fuel line. On top of that the internet has been out
       all day and now it is working off and on and is frustrating. Ugh!
       At least we are warm once again and now its time for bed and a good
       nights sleep!

       Things could be better around here. Husband is on his way to the
       doctor after having been hospitalized over the weekend with what I
       suspect is stress-related illness. All sorts of nasty things going

       Not much happening in this little village. I went into town last
       night & got a bit of grocery shopping done. Lots of red roses were
       unsold & reduced in price so I bought 2 big bunches, one for Mum &
       the other for Dad‚Äôs grave. He was a keen rose grower and knew all
       their little foibles.

       since she doesn‚Äôt have school. We checked out a new coffee house,
       took the van to the shop for a repair, did a little shopping. Now
       we‚Äôre heading out for a pedicure. Then I have to work for a few

       delivered and have the livingroom all rearranged. So glad that
