Those ties are cemented on his 40 year-marriage to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/columba-bushs-painful-unlikely-road-toward-the-white-house/2015/03/21/5918fe20-c7fd-11e4-a199-6cb5e63819d2_story.html\">Columba Garnica Gallo, </a>a native Mexican whom he fell in love with at first sight in the summer of 1971, and on his family's long-standing business associations in Mexico, which go back to the 1960s when his father was a prosperous oilman in Texas, Jeb's birth place.\r\n\r\nBoth his father and brother, George W.H. Bush and George W. Bush, made a point when they were each president of making Mexico a high priority&nbsp;of their respective foreign policies. In the 1990s, Bush senior and then Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari (1988-1994), negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a landmark agreement that inaugurated a new partnership between two historically distant neighbors.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_140893562\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"dam-image getty size-large wp-image-140893562\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/140893562/640x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\"> Jeb Bush &nbsp;and wife Columba Bush &nbsp;(Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images)[/caption]\r\n\r\nBush's and Salinas' affinities brought their families close. In 1988, as a special gesture to Salinas, Bush sent his daughter-in-law Columba to his inauguration. \"I liked Carlos Salinas, he was a joy to work with. He strongly represented Mexico's interests, but he also shared my view that the USA-Mexico bilateral relationship was of great importance,\" Bush senior told me in a 1997 interview.\r\n\r\nGeorge W. Bush took the \"especial relationship\" with Mexico to a different area: security. In the post 9/11 era, security cooperation with Mexico to fight the drug cartels and prevent terrorists from using the Southern border as a launching pad to enter the U.S., reached unprecedented levels. The U.S. poured billions of dollars into Mexico's largely failed war on drugs.\r\n\r\nTime will tell if as a scion of one of America&rsquo;s best-known political families, Jeb, who speaks fluent Spanish, will have the opportunity to follow in his father's and brother's Mexican foot steps. &nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_248317ef13e1da11af9f0014c2589dfb\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"dam-image ap size-large wp-image-248317ef13e1da11af9f0014c2589dfb\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/248317ef13e1da11af9f0014c2589dfb/640x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\"> The Bush family (AP Photo/Eric Draper, White House)[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Bushes' ties to Mexico, however, have not been free from controversy. During the first Bush Administration, Jeb and Columba became close to Ra&uacute;l Salinas de Gortari, the then President's powerful and controversial older brother.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\nAfter Salinas left office in 1994, the Salinas family fell from grace in a swirl of drug-related corruption and crime scandals. Ra&uacute;l was jailed and convicted on charges of money laundering and of masterminding the assassination of his brother-in-law; after spending 10 years in jail, Ra&uacute;l was acquitted of both crimes.\r\n\r\nWith the scandal unraveling, Jeb's friendship with Ra&uacute;l did not go unnoticed. \"There has been a great deal of speculation in Mexico about the exact nature of Ra&uacute;l Salinas' close friendship with former President George Bush's son, Jeb. It is well known here [Mexico] that for many years the two families spent vacations together--the Salinases at Jeb Bush's home in Miami, the Bushes at Raul's ranch, Las Mendocinas, under the volcano in Puebla. There are many in Mexico who believe that the relationship became a back channel for delicate and crucial negotiations between the two governments, leading up to President Bush's sponsorship of NAFTA,\" wrote Mexican intellectual Jorge G. Casta&ntilde;eda, in a 1995 <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1995-03-07/local/me-39596_1_carlos-salinas\">op-ed in The Los Angles Times.</a> Casta&ntilde;eda later became Mexico's Foreign Minister.\r\n\r\nJeb has never denied his friendship with Ra&uacute;l, who keeps a low profile in Mexico. Kristy Campbell, spokesperson for Bush, did not respond a request for comment.\r\n\r\nThe Salinas family's demise caught the Bushes by surprise. \"I have been very disappointed by the allegations about him and his family. I never had the slightest hint of information that President Salinas was anything but totally honest,\" Bush senior &nbsp;told me in the 1997 interview.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the Governor's mansion in 2007, Jeb continued to cultivate his connections to Mexico's powerful elite. In the summer of 2008, Jeb traveled to Mexico the same day Senator John McCain, the then presumptive Republican presidential nominee, paid a high-profile visit to Mexico City. Together McCain and Jeb visited the Basilica of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico's blessed saint. Later McCain and Bush dined at the U.S. Embassy with some of Mexico's most powerful businessmen, including Carlos Slim Domit, telecom mogul <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/carlos-slim-helu/?list=billionaires\">Carlos Slim Hel&uacute;'s</a>&nbsp;older son.\r\n\r\nAs the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression was unfolding, Bush had signed on as consultant to Lehman Brothers, where he was enlisted to reach out to Slim Hel&uacute; in a plan code-named Project<span>&nbsp;</span>Verde<span>&nbsp;</span>(Green Project) aimed at bailing out Lehman, &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/21/us/politics/jeb-bushs-rush-to-make-money-may-be-hurdle.html?hp&amp;_r=0\">The New York Times reported</a>.\r\n\r\nBut Slim was not interested in making a major investment in Lehman Brothers&mdash;the Wall Street giant whose bankruptcy catalyzed the financial meltdown&mdash;or striking up a joint venture with it. &ldquo;Project<span>&nbsp;</span>Verde<span>&nbsp;</span>was unsuccessful,&rdquo; Bush wrote to a Lehman colleague after his trip to Mexico, according to an <a href=\"http://web.stanford.edu/~jbulow/Lehmandocs/docs/DEBTORS/LBHI_SEC07940_212905-212906.pdf\">internal email.</a>\r\n\r\nTwitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DoliaEstevez\">@DoliaEstevez</a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;</p>","description":"Likely Republican presidential contender Jeb Bush is known to have extensive ties to Mexico's elite that once included friendship to a former Mexican President's controversial brother and a failed attempt to have telecom mogul Carlos Slim rescue Lehman Brothers","image":"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/140893562/640x0.jpg?fit=scale","type":"blog","storyType":"post","uri":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/doliaestevez/2015/04/07/jeb-bushs-mexican-connections/","comments":[],"visible":true,"blogId":"2525","authors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/663181","name":"Dolia Estevez","avatars":[{"size":136,"image":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b229ff5292c37c863e0492aa57e5cbc6?s=136&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":40,"image":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b229ff5292c37c863e0492aa57e5cbc6?s=40&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":400,"image":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b229ff5292c37c863e0492aa57e5cbc6?s=400&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":62,"image":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b229ff5292c37c863e0492aa57e5cbc6?s=62&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/doliaestevez/","type":"Contributor","profileUrl":"/sites/doliaestevez/","twitterName":"DoliaEstevez","authorType":"individual","email":"mexicobillionaire@gmail.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I cover Mexico's billionaires, politics and U.S.-Mexico relations","timestamp":1459780867111,"description":"I’m a native of Mexico who lives and works in Washington D.C. as a Foreign Correspondent.

Republican presidential contender<span>&nbsp;</span>Jeb Bush is not a “Hispanic,” as he apparently marked in a 2009 Florida voter registration application, but he does have strong connections to Mexico. Those ties are cemented on his 40 year-marriage to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/columba-bushs-painful-unlikely-road-toward-the-white-house/2015/03/21/5918fe20-c7fd-11e4-a199-6cb5e63819d2_story.html\">Columba Garnica Gallo, </a>a native Mexican whom he fell in love with at first sight in the summer of 1971, and on his family’s long-standing business associations in Mexico, which go back to the 1960s when his father was a prosperous oilman in Texas, Jeb’s birth place.</p>\n<p>Both his father and brother, George W.H. Bush and George W. Bush, made a point when they were each president of making Mexico a high priority&nbsp;of their respective foreign policies. In the 1990s, Bush senior and then Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari (1988-1994), negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a landmark agreement that inaugurated a new partnership between two historically distant neighbors.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_140893562\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"> \n <img class=\"dam-image getty size-large wp-image-140893562\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/140893562/640x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jeb Bush &nbsp;and wife Columba Bush &nbsp;(Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images)</p> \n</div>\n<p>Bush’s and Salinas’ affinities brought their families close. In 1988, as a special gesture to Salinas, Bush sent his daughter-in-law Columba to his inauguration. “I liked Carlos Salinas, he was a joy to work with. He strongly represented Mexico’s interests, but he also shared my view that the USA-Mexico bilateral relationship was of great importance,” Bush senior told me in a 1997 interview.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>George W. Bush took the “especial relationship” with Mexico to a different area: security. In the post 9/11 era, security cooperation with Mexico to fight the drug cartels and prevent terrorists from using the Southern border as a launching pad to enter the U.S., reached unprecedented levels. The U.S. poured billions of dollars into Mexico’s largely failed war on drugs.</p>\n<p>Time will tell if as a scion of one of America’s best-known political families, Jeb, who speaks fluent Spanish, will have the opportunity to follow in his father’s and brother’s Mexican foot steps. &nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_248317ef13e1da11af9f0014c2589dfb\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"> \n <img class=\"dam-image ap size-large wp-image-248317ef13e1da11af9f0014c2589dfb\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/248317ef13e1da11af9f0014c2589dfb/640x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Bush family (AP Photo/Eric Draper, White House)</p> \n</div>\n<p>The Bushes’ ties to Mexico, however, have not been free from controversy. During the first Bush Administration, Jeb and Columba became close to Ra&uacute;l Salinas de Gortari, the then President’s powerful and controversial older brother.</p>","<p>After Salinas left office in 1994, the Salinas family fell from grace in a swirl of drug-related corruption and crime scandals. Ra&uacute;l was jailed and convicted on charges of money laundering and of masterminding the assassination of his brother-in-law; after spending 10 years in jail, Ra&uacute;l was acquitted of both crimes.</p>\n<p>With the scandal unraveling, Jeb’s friendship with Ra&uacute;l did not go unnoticed. “There has been a great deal of speculation in Mexico about the exact nature of Ra&uacute;l Salinas’ close friendship with former President George Bush’s son, Jeb. It is well known here [Mexico] that for many years the two families spent vacations together–the Salinases at Jeb Bush’s home in Miami, the Bushes at Raul’s ranch, Las Mendocinas, under the volcano in Puebla. There are many in Mexico who believe that the relationship became a back channel for delicate and crucial negotiations between the two governments, leading up to President Bush’s sponsorship of NAFTA,” wrote Mexican intellectual Jorge G. Casta&ntilde;eda, in a 1995 <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1995-03-07/local/me-39596_1_carlos-salinas\">op-ed in The Los Angles Times.</a> Casta&ntilde;eda later became Mexico’s Foreign Minister.</p>\n<p>Jeb has never denied his friendship with Ra&uacute;l, who keeps a low profile in Mexico. Kristy Campbell, spokesperson for Bush, did not respond a request for comment.</p>\n<p>The Salinas family’s demise caught the Bushes by surprise. “I have been very disappointed by the allegations about him and his family. I never had the slightest hint of information that President Salinas was anything but totally honest,” Bush senior &nbsp;told me in the 1997 interview.</p>\n<p>After leaving the Governor’s mansion in 2007, Jeb continued to cultivate his connections to Mexico’s powerful elite. In the summer of 2008, Jeb traveled to Mexico the same day Senator John McCain, the then presumptive Republican presidential nominee, paid a high-profile visit to Mexico City. Together McCain and Jeb visited the Basilica of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico’s blessed saint. Later McCain and Bush dined at the U.S. Embassy with some of Mexico’s most powerful businessmen, including Carlos Slim Domit, telecom mogul <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/carlos-slim-helu/?list=billionaires\" target=\"_self\">Carlos Slim Hel&uacute;’s</a>&nbsp;older son.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>As the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression was unfolding, Bush had signed on as consultant to Lehman Brothers, where he was enlisted to reach out to Slim Hel&uacute; in a plan code-named Project<span>&nbsp;</span>Verde<span>&nbsp;</span>(Green Project) aimed at bailing out Lehman, &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/21/us/politics/jeb-bushs-rush-to-make-money-may-be-hurdle.html?hp&amp;_r=0\">The New York Times reported</a>.</p>\n<p>But Slim was not interested in making a major investment in Lehman Brothers—the Wall Street giant whose bankruptcy catalyzed the financial meltdown—or striking up a joint venture with it. “Project<span>&nbsp;</span>Verde<span>&nbsp;</span>was unsuccessful,” Bush wrote to a Lehman colleague after his trip to Mexico, according to an <a href=\"http://web.stanford.edu/~jbulow/Lehmandocs/docs/DEBTORS/LBHI_SEC07940_212905-212906.pdf\">internal email.</a></p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DoliaEstevez\">@DoliaEstevez</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"],"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"doNotPaginate":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_1section_191","channelName":"Business","sectionName":"Powering Productivity","url":"/powering-productivity","displayName":"Powering Productivity"},{"id":"channel_4","channelName":"Entrepreneurs","url":"/entrepreneurs","displayName":"Entrepreneurs"},{"id":"channel_8","channelName":"Lists","url":"/lists","displayName":"Lists"},{"id":"channel_8section_54","channelName":"Lists","sectionName":"The World's Billionaires","url":"http://www.forbes.com/billionaires","displayName":"The World's Billionaires"}],"pTagCount":0,"digestDisabled":false,"brandVoiceTitle":"Jeb Bush's Mexican Connections","allIndividualAuthors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/663181","name":"Dolia Estevez","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b229ff5292c37c863e0492aa57e5cbc6?s=40&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":62,"image":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b229ff5292c37c863e0492aa57e5cbc6?s=62&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":136,"image":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b229ff5292c37c863e0492aa57e5cbc6?s=136&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":400,"image":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b229ff5292c37c863e0492aa57e5cbc6?s=400&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/doliaestevez/","type":"Contributor","profileUrl":"/sites/doliaestevez/","twitterName":"DoliaEstevez","authorType":"individual","email":"mexicobillionaire@gmail.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I cover Mexico's billionaires, politics and U.S.-Mexico relations","timestamp":1459780867111,"description":"I’m a native of Mexico who lives and works in Washington D.C. as a Foreign Correspondent.
