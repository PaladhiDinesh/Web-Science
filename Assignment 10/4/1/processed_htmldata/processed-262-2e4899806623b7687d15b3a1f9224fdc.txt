The Second Avenue Subway explained

Written by: REBECCA HARSHBARGER AND CRISTIAN SALAZAR

   The construction of the Second Avenue Subway on the Upper East Side has
   been an epic odyssey. But after decades of false starts, officials said
   on Friday that the subway line’s first phase is 90% complete.

   The journey to launch the new line goes back to the 1920s, when the
   route was first proposed by a state agency. Construction has been
   derailed by the Great Depression, World War II, the city’s financial
   woes in the seventies, and the challenges of building in one of the
   densest neighborhoods in the country.

   The state finally broke ground on this first phase of the line in April
   2007, though construction work had been undertaken in previous decades
   in Chinatown and East Harlem.

   MTA officials say that once it is complete, the Second Avenue Subway
   will allow residents and workers to be able to get to the west side of
   Manhattan more easily, and many commuters near Second Avenue may be
   able to skip bus or car service.

   “There are many benefits. It will give the Upper East Side more travel
   options that they didn’t have,” said board member Andrew Albert,
   chairman of the Transit Riders Council.

   Here’s what else you need to know about the Second Avenue Subway.

The Second Avenue Subway is designed to take ridership pressure off the
crowded Lexington Line

   The MTA expects the new subway route to

   The MTA expects the new subway route to be used by 200,000 people each
   weekday, which will take ridership pressure off the Lexington Avenue
   route, the most-used transit line in the country. Currently, that
   route, on the Upper East Side, is served by the No. 4, 5, and 6 trains.
   That’s in stark contrast to the Upper West Side, which is served by
   both the Broadway lines (No. 1, 2, and 3 trains) and the Central Park
   West lines (the B and C trains). The neighborhood once had two other
   subway routes on Second and Third avenues, but the noisy elevated
   routes were torn down to improve real estate values.(Credit: Brian via

There’s a ‘moderate risk’ the MTA won’t be able to meet its Dec. 2016
deadline

   The Second Avenue Subway was designed to be

   The Second Avenue Subway was designed to be built in four phases. The
   $4.45 billion first phase, which is currently under construction, will
   include three stations on 96th, 86th, and 72nd streets. It is scheduled
   to open to the public in December 2016. However, the MTA is behind on
   track installation and construction of entrances at the future 72nd
   Street station, as well as bringing power to the 86th Street
   station.(Credit: MTA)

No one reading this story will likely be alive when the Second Avenue Subway
is completed

   It's unclear when the other three phases will

   It’s unclear when the other three phases will be completed or how much
   they will cost. There is $535 million budgeted in the 2015-2019 capital
   plan for design work and utility location for the second phase that
   runs to East Harlem, with tunneling expected to begin after 2019. The
   third phase will run to Houston Street, the fourth to the Financial
   District.

The three new stations will have new features to keep them cool and
accessible

   While there won't be air conditioning at the

   While there won’t be air conditioning at the new stations, they will be
   10 degrees cooler than it is on the street due to climate controls. The
   stations will all have Wi-Fi and porcelain panels that are easier to
   clean. They will also be accessible by wheelchair; there will be
   elevators and escalators. They have an open style and are
   column-free.(Credit: MTA)

The Q train will serve the Second Avenue Subway

   When the Q is sent to the Upper

   When the Q is sent to the Upper East Side, instead of Queens, the MTA
   may bring back the W train that hasn’t been around since 2010. N train
   riders who currently have only local service in Manhattan may then get
   express service back. Local stations along the Broadway line that the N
   currently serve will likely need another train to make up for the loss
   of service.(Credit: gmpicket via Flickr)

The cost of building the Second Avenue Subway was once estimated at $86
million

   When the Second Avenue Subway was proposed in

   When the Second Avenue Subway was proposed in the 1920s, it was
   estimated it would cost $86 million to build it from the Harlem River
   to Houston Street. The MTA is spending $4.45 billion on the three new
   stops, as well as a connection to the Lexington Avenue/63rd Street
   station.(Credit: MTA)
