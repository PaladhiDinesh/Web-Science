Former Mexican President: We're Not Paying for a 'Stupid' Wall

   A former Mexican president had some tough words when asked about GOP
   candidate Donald Trump's much-touted plan to build a border wall that
   he says will be paid fo[97]r by Mexico.

   "We are not going to pay any single cent for such a stupid wall! And
   it's going to be completely useless," said former Mexican president
   Felipe Calderón when asked about this at the AmCham Egypt for Business
   Conference on Sunday.

   Calderón had harsh words about the Republican presidential race during
   his conversation with [98]CNBC's Hadley Gamble, saying it was
   "incredible" that quite an "admirable society" like the U.S. had
   candidates like Trump.

   York City. Leigh Vogel

   "No offense, no offense to America. So Donald Trump … is ambitious but
   not exactly very well-informed man, I don't want to say ignorant, but
   he is not very well informed," said Calderón.

   Trump has made border issues and immigration one of the key
   centerpieces of his campaign, saying on the day he announced he was
   running that Mexico was [101]sending "rapists" and "criminals." The
   controversial remarks set off a cascade of events including [102]strong
   condemnation from the U.S. Latino community - [103]including Latino
   Republicans - and the severing of several business relationships
   i[104]ncluding one with NBC. Despite the controversy, Trump has
   escalated his rhetoric on immigration issues and has called for a ban
   on Muslims entering the U.S. to combat terrorism.

   The former Mexican president said "the first loser of such a policy
   would be the United States - If this guy pretends that closing the
   borders to anywhere either for trade [or] for people is going to
   provide prosperity to the United States, he is completely crazy."

   Calderón also took issue with Trump's statements that illegal
   immigration from Mexico is a big and escalating problem. According to a
   Pew Research report in November, more Mexicans were [105]emigrating
   from the U.S. than entering.

   "They don't want to go, they can work for a motor company (that's) not
   in Detroit, I am sorry to say," said Calderón about the fact that fewer
   Mexicans want to go to the U.S. "They are working for a motor company
   in Hermosillo and Toluca, so Mazda is coming to Mexico, Honda is coming
   to Mexico. Those kids have jobs in that industry in Mexico."
