2016 Health Resolutions + Win 1 of 20 $50 Walmart Gift Cards! Ends 2/15

   This post was sponsored by Nature Made® as a part of an Influencer
   Activation for Influence Central.
   Are you a resolution maker? I think that a lot of people fail at their
   resolutions because they make them too hard to achieve. I'm going slow
   this year by resolving to improve my health, which isn't as difficult
   as you might think. It's just a matter of eating a balanced diet,
   drinking lots of water, and adding in a few Nature Made supplements
   where they're lacking. We're just into February now and because I set
   the bar fairly low, I'm still going strong.
   It may not be the 1st of the year, but it's never too late to start a
   healthy journey, and 20 readers will each win a $50 Walmart gift card
   to help get them on the right track for 2016!
   [23][Nature-Made-HERO.jpg]
   If you're wondering which supplements might be right for you, just look
   at your current health for clues. Are you tired all the time, have
   lackluster hair and brittle nails, or get sick more often than you
   should? Perhaps heart problems run in the family? Now is the time to
   take care of your body so that it will carry your into your later years
   in good condition.
   I choose Nature Made supplements because they are the nation’s #1
   best-selling brand for quality vitamins, minerals and supplements* to
   help support nutritional gaps and they are also the #1 Pharmacist
   recommended supplement brand in 9 categories**. Pharmacists are who we
   go to for OTC help, and they always know what the best, most effective
   products are.
   [24][Nature-Made-shop.jpg]
   I get my supplements at Walmart because they have the best prices and
   you don't need to wait for a sale to stock up. Look at the prices in
   the above photo! You would usually see these prices on the "store
   brand" supplements in other places. The store brand is fine in a lot of
   cases, but not when it comes to my health. I want the good stuff, and
   at Walmart, you can get it for less than anywhere else.
   [25][Vitamin-D.jpg]
   I am deficient in D, especially in the winter months. The lack of
   sunlight and always using sunscreen means lack of D production and it
   makes me feel tired and just blah. So, taking extra Vitamin D is a must
   for me. I can get it prescribed, but buying it OTC is much cheaper.
   [26][B-Complex-Vitamins.jpg]
   [27][B12-Vitamins.jpg]
   Something new I've decided to add are B Vitamins. Too often I feel worn
   out and stressed and B Vitamins can help with cellular energy
   production and a healthy nervous system. I love that the Nature Made
   B-Complex has added Vitamin C to help the immune system as well.
   [28][Vitamins-in-hand.jpg]
   Supplements are the easiest way to get your health back on track,
   especially if your diet is lacking these vitamins and minerals. I've
   found the easiest way to organize and remember is to get a weekly pill
   case. You know the ones: each compartment is labeled with a day of the
   week? It makes it so much easier for me to make sure I take them and
   see if I missed a day (yes, I have senior moments at 36!)
   [29][3-Nature-Made-Vitamins.jpg]
   Another easy way to help you reach your wellness goals it to join the
   [30]Nature Made Daily Boost microsite. They've put together a series of
   Daily Boosts that are not complicated, don’t take much time, and are an
   easy way to help you feel great. I've joined. Will you join with me and
   take charge of your health this year?
   *Based in part on data reported by Nielsen through its Scantrack
   Service for the Vitamins Category for 52-week period ending 9/26/2015,
   for the xAOC, FDM, and FM Markets. Copyright © 2015 Nielsen.
   **Based on US News & World Report – Pharmacy Times Survey, Nature Made
   is the #1 Pharmacist Recommended Brand in Nine Categories – Letter
   Vitamins, Omega-3/Fish Oil, Coenzyme Q10, Flax Seed Oil, Herbal
   Supplements, Cholesterol Management-Natural, Garlic, Diabetic
   Multivitamins and Mood Health Supplements
