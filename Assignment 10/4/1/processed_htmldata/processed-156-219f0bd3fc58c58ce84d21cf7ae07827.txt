       Often these items are introduced as specials or ideas. If they are
       successful, they keep them, otherwise they drop them off the menu.
       I think they had a big problem when it came to consistency with
       that flavour and people were less than satisfied.

       Apparently they weren't selling well enough to keep them on the
       menu.

     * Why did Subway cancel Mediterranean subs? I love Medit food..? NATO
       will nuke Ukraine to blame Russia for it; then NATO will nuke
       Russia from Scandinavia. China will attack Russia; but will not get
       past Ural Mountains. Russia will destroy Turkey and America. China
       will have a hole across the whole country to the abyss. Only
       Eurasia and Alaska (both without coasts) will remain after demons
       blow up Antarctica (which surrounds the flat earth) and Greenland
       melts. Move to Ural Mountains or inland Alaska. Sionists want war
       between Russia and Germany over Serbia from June to October on
       their holidays because (666 times 3)+(6 times 3) = 2016 (in their
       twisted logic).
       Tube people = demons. Clones = demons. Human costumes that demons
       wear = demons. Dinosaurs and 666ed people have triple stranded DNA;
       normal person can't swallow 666ed food (designed for 666ed people).
       Demons live inside clones. Bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin (who
       discovered Bubonic plague) is depicted on the Shroud of Turin.
       There is another shroud on which blasphemer Yosef (who was
       crucified on a pole in 1066 AD) is depicted. Menachem Mendel
       Schneerson, Lenin (el=deity in Hebrew, nine = no in German; so,
       when chanted repeatedly is blasphemy against the Creator), and
       Yosef were possessed by Azazel; now, Rico Cortes is possessed by
       Azazel.
       WW3 happens; 7% of people will be left; after people are tired of
       war, they will elect the antichrist as one world leader; don't
       vote. ISIS stands for Israeli Secret Intelligence Service. Next
       false flag: Statue of Liberty in order to attack Iran. Move away
       from coasts as nukes will go off in the ocean (at where tectonic
       plates meet; result: megatsunamis 1km high).
       Wear natural clothing so that if a bomb goes off it won't stick to
       the body as fast as synthetic clothes. All metal will be burned for
       fuel; so, save knives, crowbars, shovels, wood-burning stoves, etc.
       Also, save cloth/fabric/textile to cover the wounds and diseases.
       Eat natural food because nanochips, cells of aborted fetuses, bug
       DNA, and other poisons are in food that is commonly sold. Seraphim
       of Sarov and Sergiy of Radonezh will be resurrecred after WW3 for a
       short time; Seraphim of Sarov will show the new Ruski Tsar who will
       fight the antichrist for about 2 years and 8-10 months.
       Earth is flat; stands on 3 pillars (the Most Holy Trinity); pillars
       stand on water at zero Kelvin. Zodiac is planetary prison of
       demons; don't believe in horoscopes or you'll exhibit the traits of
       the trapped demons. Most thoughts and dreams are from demons;
       demons never do good. Sleep fully clothed; pray the Jesus prayer.
       Pray to your guardian angel to have normal sleep.
       Humans were created about 7525 years ago. Ruski Orthodox Christian
       Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov was the last prophet before Enoch and
       Elijah return to preach against the antichrist.
       Birds participate in time creation. It's a sin to kill birds.
       Dinosaurs live under our level. They will get out through sinkholes
       and lakes. To kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but
       kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in
       Russia.
       Demons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and
       put it on so as to look like us. Demons will invite people to be
       healed inside their UFOs; those who go will be like zombies after.
       Gov't provides demons with diamonds and allows demons to abduct
       people. If you're being abducted, slowly pray the Jesus prayer.
       Don't panic. Demons use diamonds and souls to power their UFO
       craft. The bigger the diamond, the more it lasts. Demons have 4 UFO
       bases: 1)Moon 2)Inside fake mountain Kailash in Tibet 3)In lake
       Baikal in Russia 4)In Atlantis which is underneath the Mariana
       Trench in Pacific Ocean. There are no aliens. Nobody lives on other
       planets.
       Airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the
       airspace to fight Jesus. Antichrist is pale with red eyes. He's
       possessed by Satan since he's 12 years old. He flies. He wears
       gloves to hide long nails. He's surrounded by demons who appear as
       angels of light.
       Don't go into a UFO to be healed by demons. Green 666 is given by
       isotope rays on wrist or forehead when people stretch hands to
       receive small plastic grey card with no name on it (World
       Passport). Police will microchip and isotope ray people on the
       highways. Microchipped people will be influenced by computers to
       take grey plastic card; but when they do, 666 is given. Food stores
       will isotope ray people too. Antichrist will also release prisoners
       to mark people. Reject 666 at all cost because it leads to
       permanent hell.
       If you're about to be marked, pray the Jesus prayer. Hide with
       Orthodox Christians to escape 666; leave all electronics behind so
       that antichrist's minions can't track you. Give to charity in the
       name of Archangel Michael; he rescues people from temporary hell
       twice a year (or brings them up a level, that is, to a level with
       less punishment; eventually, people are freed). Feed the pigeons;
       when pigeons bow down, people are saved from temporary hell.
       Forgive me.
