   In an [30]effort to promote the use of reusable bags and reduce waste,
   Walmart Canada announced on Monday that it will start charging
   customers who request plastic bags at checkout. The new initiative is
   part of its ongoing efforts to ultimately achieve zero waste.

   The elimination of free single-use plastic bags will be rolled out
   across Canada starting February 9. Customers who request plastic bags
   at checkout will be charged five cents per bag.

   Walmart [31]wmt recognizes that it’s asking customers to change their
   shopping behavior, Lee Tappenden, chief operations officer of Walmart
   Canada said in a statement. “[B]ut we strongly believe that removing
   plastic film from our waste stream is imperative to reaching our goal
   of zero waste and will encourage our customers to broaden their already
   existing waste-reduction efforts.” He said that in other international
   markets, fees encouraging customers to use reusable bags has reduced
   single-use plastic bags by more than 50%. “Similar programs here in
   Canada have reported comparable successes,” he said.

   In October, [32]customers in England faced a plastic bag fee for the
   first time. It was the [33]last country in the United Kingdom to adopt
   a plastic bag ban. At the time of the ban, consumers in England
   [34]used 12 plastic bags per month. In Wales, where a bag tax has been
   in place since 2011, shoppers used two bags per month.

   Tesco, Britain’s largest retailer, [35]said in early December that the
   use of plastic bags have dropped 80% since England’s ban went into
   place.

   In the U.S. some states have adopted similar bans. In July, [36]grocery
   stores in Hawaii were banned from distributing plastic bags and
   [37]about 150 cities and counties in California have instituted similar
   rules. [38]A city-wide ban on plastic bags also went into effect in
   Chicago this summer.

   In announcing its plastic bag ban in Canada, Walmart cited a study
   introduced at the 2016 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland last
   week that says that by 2050, [39]the ocean is expected to contain more
   plastic than fish by weight if there are no efforts taken to reduce
   plastic pollution.
