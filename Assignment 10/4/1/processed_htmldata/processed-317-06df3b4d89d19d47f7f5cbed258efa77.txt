   Ascending: rising or increasing to higher levels, values, or degrees
   Butterflies: The change from caterpillar though to the chrysalis and
   emergence as a butterfly is the greatest change in the animal world. It
   symbolises significant change in the course of one’s life, personality
   or way of thinking. Putting them together brings us on an upwards
   journey of change and transformation, isn't that what we all strive
   for?

[12]@JennyCraig 5 day weight loss starter kit available exclusively at
@Walmart #JennyCraigKit #spon

   [13]Jenny Craig's new weight loss starter kits being sold exclusively
   at Walmart
   If you checked out Friday's [14]Instagram and [15]Blog Post Teaser,
   then you know I am going to spill the tea today on Jenny Craig's new
   weight loss kits being sold exclusively at [16]Walmart in participating
   stores. (right now in store only)
   Last year I entered a blog contest over at [17]The Chatty Momma for one
   month of Jenny Craig which included weekly one-on-one consultations
   with a dedicated consultant who would help identify challenges, map out
   goals and track my progress as well as a one month supply of food.
   Shout out to Tonia for the amazing giveaway, it really helped me get a
   good running start to re-vamping my Lifestyle Choices when it comes to
   meals and portion control.
   That was my first ever intro to Jenny Craig, I had never tried a
   program like this prior to this experience and I am happy to report I
   was successful at losing weight with the program - Members following
   the Jenny Craig program on average lose 1-2 lbs. a week.
   Out of the four weeks, I had only one 'un-successful' week and it is
   because I didn't stick with it, I was away from the meals most of that
   week because of my insane schedule - that is the only week I gained,
   not much, but it proved without a shadow of a doubt that if you stick
   to it, the program really does yield results. I wasn't just 'out and
   about' I was traveling so I couldn't take the food with me, if only
   this kit had been available then, I could have just purchased one when
   I landed!
   As promised, I am going to prove to you that this average sized box
   actually contains 3 meals a day PLUS a snack for FIVE days (here is the
   kit 'un-boxed'):
   [18]Jenny Craig's new weight loss starter kits being sold exclusively
   at Walmart un-boxed to show contents
   Contents:
   Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ - Five healthy Breakfasts! (Very Left with the Yellow Labels)
   Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ - Five Healthy Lunches! (Second to Left with Orange Coded
   Labels)
   Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ - Five Healthy Dinners! (Second to Right with Green Labels)
   Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ - Five Tasty Snacks! (Far Right with Purple Labels - a little
   salty and a little sampling of sweet - because sometimes you want
   chocolate other times chips!)
   Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ - One month free consultation at any Jenny Craig Center or
   Jenny Craig Anywhere
   Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ - ***Special $50 food savings when you join a Jenny Craig
   Center***
   The Jenny Craig Weight Loss Starter Kit is available exclusively at
   [19]Walmart - right now in store only - there are also three day kits
   available (the three day kits retail for $44.98) - those kits have the
   chocolate dream shakes in them which I highly recommend! (If you buy
   both kits you'll have the weekend covered too! PERK)
   For the truly observant you may notice my kit accidentally contained 4
   dinners and 6 lunches but if that happens to you don't worry you can
   substitute - I just used one of the lunches for dinner.
   and one of the things I love about the program is that you can add a
   salad to any lunch or dinner - now just remember, it's NOT the salad
   that does folks in, it's the dressing - the plan comes with a
   pre-portioned balsamic dressing that I really love. They also offer
   'anytime' items.
   MY TAKE:
   Advantages/Loves/Pros:
   Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ - The fact that this kit does NOT require refrigeration and
   can be stored at room temp makes it perfect for my 'cubicle chicks' -
   no worries about stuff disappearing from the office fridge. (In my
   younger days I worked on a Trading Floor and lunches constantly
   disappeared from the Fridge - not cool, especially in winter!) - Just
   store them in your desk and you have all your meals literally at your
   fingertips. And with having the dinners with you, if you work late, you
   are covered and don't have to worry about being starved by the time you
   get home.
   Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ - Hate meal planning? - BOOM, this kit plans for you - it
   literally doesn't get easier than that.
   Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ -  Hate shopping for a ton of ingredients you don't end up
   using or having food go bad? Not going to happen with this kit. With me
   being a single gal in the city with no kids I don't want to prepare
   elaborate meals just for me - lunches especially - I don't have time
   for it, so this is absolutely perfect for me. I also tend to skip
   breakfast if left to my own devices, this system helps me start my day
   with something in my system making me less likely to snack before lunch
   and give me more energy. PERK!
   Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ - Even as a SOHO (small office/home office) I love that I can
   always have something portion controlled, healthy and TASTY at my
   disposal. They are super fast to prepare which is perfect and some of
   the lunches that don't even require heating like the salad kits
   (chicken or tuna salad with whole wheat crackers and apple sauce) can
   be tucked into your purse for a meal on the go so you are less likely
   to cheat while out.
   Cons: (these are actually not 'bad' - totally personal preference
   stuff)
   Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ - In the beginning it takes getting used to the smaller sizes,
   especially for the snacks. Re-training my brain can be hard, especially
   when I am up late at night trying to meet deadlines - that is my
   snacktime danger zone. I know enough to know it can be exhaustion from
   working solid so many hours coupled with de-hydration from not taking
   enough breaks that make me crave the bad for me snacks. I wish the
   snack portion sizing were a bit bigger but that's the point - not to
   cut out snacking completely, just learn to cut back. By the way, while
   it was not included in this kit - the triple chocolate cheesecake from
   Jenny Craig's is addictive and rivals any of my favorite cheesecakes
   hands down. A pro and a con indeed! Delicious - total pro, the fact
   that I want to eat at least four of them in one sitting a con! LOL
   Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ - I am a grab and go if at all Breakfast person - the
   chocolate dream shake is PERFECT, but it is not included in this
   particular kit (I am at an advantage and dis-advantage that I am
   familiar with the entire range of meals offered and have my favorites!)
   I do wish this five day kit included the shakes as the shakes can also
   be used for a boost mid-day if you are craving something and are far
   from your next meal time, the shakes are considered 'anytime' items (as
   well as many of the bars like the Chocolate Peanut Butter Anytime Bar).
   Nothing to count, just follow along the menu plan and it outlines how
   to incorporate anytime items into your day.
   Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ - Now I don't know if all the kits are like that, but I wish
   mine hadn't repeated meals more than once, and had given me total
   variety with something different each day but I have a feeling that
   most of the other meals are ones that require refrigeration so that is
   why they weren't included.

     Now I know what you are thinking butterflies, "but butterfly if the
     program worked for you, why didn't you stay on it longer than the
     trial month?"

   Good Question, simply put the weekly meetings were really hard to fit
   into my schedule. I am a Life Coach, Social Media Consultant, Freelance
   Writer and Blogger and commuting to the city as there is no branch
   closer to me just for the consultations got harder and harder to
   schedule, now that the kits can be picked up at MY convenience I can
   see myself picking it up again to jump start my way into Spring and get
   myself back on track eating wise and portion control wise. Also, with
   the beverages, hauling the food from the branch to my home as someone
   who does not drive and was taking public transportation was also a
   challenge for me, this kit is way lighter and much more compact and can
   be picked up during a regular shopping trip closer to home so it's a
   total win/win in my book.
   For those of you who decide to become full members after trying the
   weight loss kit, here are my personal food faves from the Jenny Craig
   Menu:
   Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ - Breakfast Faves: Egg, Cheese & Turkey Sausage Burrito,
   Florentine Breakfast Pizzas (Whole Wheat Crust, Scrambled Egg White,
   Spinach and a blend of cheeses and BACON, yes Bacon!) and for me I used
   the Chocolate Dream Shakes often for Breakfast as well.
   Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ - Lunch Faves: Baja Style Chicken Quesadilla, Creamy Chicken
   and Corn Chowder, Stuffed Pizza Bites, White Bean Chicken Chili (this
   one is included in the kit! PERK!)
   Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ - Dinner Faves: Turkey Chili, Chicken Carbonara (which has
   BACON!), Chicken Fettucini, White Fish and Mushroom Risotto
   Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ - Snack Faves: Bruschetta Veggie Chips, Black Bean Taco Chips,
   Chocolate Lava Cake and Gold Stars to the Triple Chocolate Cheesecake!
   When following the program, I lost just under 2 pounds per week each
   week, so I hope that the new kits at Walmart will also be made
   available soon at Walmart.com because having it delivered right to my
   door would definitely make an already good thing - that much better!
   What say YOU? Do you shop at Walmart? Will you be making a bee line for
   the diet/weight loss aisle to try the new Jenny Craig 5 day Weight Loss
   Starter Kit exclusively at Walmart? The Ground hog says Spring is
   coming early and you know what that means - summer isn't far behind!

       I think changing portion sizes is what really either makes a diet
       work or not work. That is why programs such as this work for many
       people. Because you only get to eat what is delivered to you,
       assuming you do not load up on stuff that is not on the plan.

       advocated listening to your coach, carrying approved snacks all the
       time, and no cheating. Willpower is definitely a good thing.

       I am intrigued by the idea of doing a program like this one, where
       all of your food is already planned out. My issue right now is
       family dinners. I don't want to give my kids the wrong idea by
       eating a different meal than them. Do you think it would still be
       effective if I ate just breakfast and lunch from Jenny Craig, but
       ate our family dinners as usual?
