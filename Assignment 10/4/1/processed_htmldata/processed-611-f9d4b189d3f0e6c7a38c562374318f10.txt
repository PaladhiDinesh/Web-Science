Donald Trump Jr.: Bush Family ‘Used Eminent Domain’ For Texas Rangers Stadium

GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. joined host
Stephen K. Bannon on Breitbart News Daily on Monday, ahead of New Hampshire’s
primary election on Tuesday, and took a swipe at former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush
for going after his father on the issue of eminent domain during Saturday’s
GOP debate.

   Trump told Bannon that there are “times that it has to be used.” For
   example, to build hospitals, roads and the Keystone pipeline would
   require the use of eminent domain.

   “Jeb Bush going all, ‘It’s so terrible’ – Jeb Bush and his family, when
   they were part owners of the Texas Rangers” used eminent domain to
   build the stadium, Trump alleged.

   Trump said, “It’s always going to be limited government with him,”
   referring to his father and those that question if he will cut the size
   of government once he’s in office.

   “You can’t have a business that’s successful if it’s bloated with
   bureaucracy,” he added, saying his dad thinks in terms of running a
   business. “That’s how he’s going to run the country.”

   Trump said his father would get rid of the fraud and waste that
   continues to grow, “That’s the way he runs a business.”

   He said Wall Street and the financial elite are rejecting his father’s
   presidential campaign because they know they can’t “control him” and
   want to be puppet masters.

   “They all way to be king makers…they know they’re not going to own
   him,” he charged.

   He said growing up with his father, he was taught “don’t take anything
   for granted.”

   “He made us work when we were young,” he added. “He made us understand
   the value of a dollar.”
