   HOUSTON -- A $50,000 reward is now being offered for information
   leading to the arrest of the suspects who killed a popular McDonald’s
   franchise owner.

   Carroll Oliver was shot in the parking lot of his McDonald's restaurant
   in the 5300 block of the East Freeway on Jan. 11 around 9:40 a.m.
   Oliver was approached by several unknown black and Hispanic male
   suspects in a white, newer-model SUV.

   The suspects shot Oliver during a robbery attempt and fled westbound on
   the East Freeway. Oliver died at the scene.

   His family is speaking out for the first time.

     Carroll Oliver's daughter Stephanie Urging people 2 call

   "Emotionally, physically, psychologically, we were all taken away,"
   said Stephanie Oliver. "They didn't just take my dad's life, they took
   a big chunk of our lives, too. Please call Crime Stoppers. Our Father’s
   Day, birthdays, any holiday won't be the same."

   Tips can be made to Crime Stoppers by Calling 713-222-TIPS, submitted
   online here or by texting TIP610 with the information to CRIMES
   (274637).

   Investigators continue to work every angle of the case to determine if
   this was an inside job. Investigators now say they’re expanding their
   investigation.

   "We're trying to find the right person who did the wrong thing," said
   Detective Fil Waters. "Hopefully we can give this family some peace and
   closure."
