Muslim Hijab Barbie Becomes Instagram Star

   by [25]Dr. Susan Berry8 Feb 2016[26]0
   8 Feb, 2016 8 Feb, 2016

A new Muslim, hijab-wearing Barbie doll has taken Instagram by storm.

   The [27]doll that has been a fashion icon for decades has recently
   undergone some [28]transformations – different skin tones and body
   types – and now has appeared as “Hijarbie,” wearing the Muslim hijab.

   Haneefa Adam, who earned a Masters degree in pharmacology in the UK,
   says she was inspired to create the Hijarbie Instagram account after
   coming across the [29]Barbie Style Instagram page.

   “I thought I had not seen Barbie dressed in a hijab before so I decided
   to open an Instagram account and dressed Barbie up in the clothes that
   I made,” Adam said, [30]reports CNN. “I thought it was really important
   for a doll to be dressed like how I would be.”

   Adam contrasts the often scantily clad Western Barbie to her Hijarbie
   which she says is a “modest doll” — one that offers Muslim girls a role
   model to whom they can relate.

   “It has roots in my religion and cultural identity,” she added. “The
   way Barbie dresses is very skimpy and different and there’s nothing
   wrong with it. I just wanted to give another option for Muslim girls
   like me.”

   According to the news report, Hijarbie how has 19,400 followers on
   Instagram, and there have been many requests from throughout the world
   to purchase the doll.

   Nevertheless, Adam says some comments she has received have viewed the
   hijab as a sign that Muslim women are “oppressed,” a notion that Adam
   denies and claims is a misconception.

   “People think that when Muslim women cover up they are forced to,” she
   said. “[The] majority of us are not.”

   “We want to cover up and express our religion,” she continued. “But a
   lot of Muslims don’t cover their hair and it doesn’t make them any less
   of a Muslim. I think this is a great platform to try and get the Muslim
   identity to the world and correct some misconceptions.”

   However, two Muslim women [31]penned a December op-ed at the Washington
   Post in which they say the hijab campaign is intended to hide Islam’s
   sexist political agenda, and urged Americans to stand against Islam’s
   ideological oppression of women.

   “Journalists and media outlets must stop making the mistake of defining
   hijab as ‘headscarf,’ furthering a sexist propaganda campaign to equate
   the two,” wrote Asra Q. Nomani and Hala Arafa.

   The two Muslim women noted:

     In the name of ‘interfaith,’ well-intentioned Americans are getting
     duped by the agenda of Muslims who argue that a woman’s honor lies
     in her ‘chastity,’ pushing a platform to put a headscarf on every
     woman. Please do this instead: Do not wear a headscarf in
     ‘solidarity’ with the ideology that most silences us, equating our
     bodies with ‘honor.’ Stand with us instead with moral courage
     against the ideology of Islamism that demands we cover our hair.

   In their op-ed, Nomani and Arafa argued that events such as “[32]World
   Hijab Day” – during which non-Muslim women are invited to don the hijab
   in solidarity with Muslims – hides a political goal.

   “Muslim special-interest groups are feeding articles about
   ‘[33]Muslim women in hijab‘ under siege,” the authors say. “Staff
   members at the Council on American-Islamic Relations [CAIR], which has
   pressed legal and PR complaints against U.S. companies including Disney
   World and Abercrombie & Fitch, have even called their organization ‘the
   hijab legal defense fund.’”

   A [34]federal judge concluded in 2009 that “the government has
   produced [35]ample evidence to establish the associations of [36]CAIR …
   with Hamas” the jihad-group based in Gaza that shoots rockets in
   Israeli towns and communities. Since then, [37]FBI leaders have sharply
   reduced any connection to the group, which has also been and has been
   declared [38]a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates.
