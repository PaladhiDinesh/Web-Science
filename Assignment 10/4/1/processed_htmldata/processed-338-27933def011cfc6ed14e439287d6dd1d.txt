       I can’t remember a Valentine’s Day that I didn’t work. If for some
       odd reason I’m at home, we’ll probably have a quiet dinner, we
       don’t get a lot of those!

       I usually do not do anything special to celebrate. I might go
       shopping with my mom.

       My hubby and I are planning to cook a gourmet dinner on Valentine’s
       Day. We are still deciding on a recipe and we will have wine and
       music :)

       I don’t celebrate valentines day so I will not be doing much, just
       a regular day for me.

       My husband and I normally go out for dinner and maybe a movie. But
       my husband puts his foot down – no chic flicks even on Valentine
       Day.
