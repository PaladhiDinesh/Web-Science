   Donald Trump has defended himself against accusations of Islamophobia
   by claimed that he has “at least 20” Muslim friends.

   The Republican presidential candidate has repeatedly said that “Muslims
   love him” despite his provocative policies, but has so far failed to
   name any single individual Muslim supporter.

   Asked by The Daily Telegraph to elaborate, Trump again ducked the
   question responding: “Oh, I could give you about 20 of them.”

   The real estate mogul made the comment moments after coming off the
   stage of the Republican debate in New Hampshire, days before the state
   primary.

   During the debate he asserted that as president he would reinstate
   waterboarding as an interrogation technique of the US military, and
   “worse”.

   Asked in the spin room afterwards what he meant by this, Trump told
   reporters: “One day you’ll see”.

   Trump bills himself as the “straight-talking” anti-establishment
   candidate, in an election that is in large part being shaped by a
   popular disaffection with conventional Washington politics.

   After the shooting in San Bernadino, California, in which 14 people
   were killed in an attack by supporters of the Islamic State of Iraq and
   the Le and in response to the growing refugee crisis, Trump responded
   by calling for all Muslims to be temporarily banned from the United
   States.

   The comments sparked an international backlash with business partners
   in Arab countries disowning him.

   In Dubai, a firm building a multi-billion dollar development in Dubai
   with Trump stripped his name and image from the property.

   Donald Trump Jnr, the tycoon’s son, was also unable to says who his
   father’s Muslim friends were, saying only that they had “completed a
   lot of business deals” in the Middle East.

   Trump’s comment about waterboarding was the most hawkish response to
   the question given to the presidential candidates by the moderators in
   the televised debate.

   Ted Cruz hedged his bets, saying he “would not bring it back in any
   widespread use”.

   Rubio also left the question on the table, sticking to his nebulous
   response that it is not right to give away intelligence secrets.

   While Trump has caught the headlines, Rubio has the strongest
   neoconservative credentials.

   The Florida senator’s plans to increase military spending and expand
   America’s presence abroad, as well as encourage the spread of
   democracy, are a revival of the doctrines of the era of George W Bush.

   Rubio has tried to distance himself from the neo-conservative label –
   mindful of how the designation was rendered toxic by the disastrous
   Bush administration invasion of Iraq in 2003.

   But several key advisers and staff – including Alex Conant, his
   communications director – first earned their political stripes working
   for Bush.

   Speaking in New Hampshire, just days before the primary election, Rubio
   has even adopted Bush-era rhetoric, telling his audiences that as
   president he would defeat Isil by starting a “real war on terror.”
