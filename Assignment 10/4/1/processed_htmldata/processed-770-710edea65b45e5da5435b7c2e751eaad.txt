Ted Cruz's Latest Mailer Is Almost Too Much To Be Believed

A liberal group has filed a complaint, arguing the mailer violates Texas law.

   MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is out with a deceptive new
   mailer that masquerades as official government business and promises
   people there's a "check enclosed" when it's actually asking for money
   instead.

   A New Jersey resident sent The Huffington Post the latest piece of mail
   he received from Cruz's campaign. The envelope appears to have come
   from Cruz's Senate office and has his name printed the same way it
   often is for Senate business. In small type the mailer clarifies that
   it is for "personal" matters and was not sent at taxpayers' expense. It
   also promises a check.
   [56b7fea11a00002d00ab2293.png] HuffPost

   But the check inside -- which is made out to the Cruz campaign, not to
   the voter -- is fake. The accompanying letter promises that a "group of
   generous supporters" have promised to match donations received in
   response to the mailer.

   [56b7ff3b1800002d0080b704.jpeg] HuffPost

   The New Jersey voter who received the mailer and asked not to be named
   said the letter would be enough to "fool my mother-in-law."

   Readers from about a dozen other states wrote in after this story was
   published to say they'd received the same mailer. It appears to have
   been sent out widely, to registered Democrats, Republicans and
   Independents. One man in Pennsylvania said his nine-year-old child
   received a copy of the letter addressed to him.

   Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for the Cruz campaign, said the mailer
   "clearly indicates that the contribution is going to the Cruz for
   President campaign" and noted that "match-type fundraising mailers are
   common to both campaign and non-profit solicitations."

   She pointed to other GOP mailers that are very similar.

   As the Iowa caucuses were underway, the Cruz campaign told voters that
   Ben Carson was dropping out of the race -- hoping his backers might
   instead support Cruz, who ultimately ended up winning. Carson did not
   drop out, and he and his supporters are [83]still angry about the
   incident.

   UPDATE: 2/8 -- The liberal group Progress Texas has filed a complaint
   with the Texas attorney general's office, arguing that Cruz's mailer
   violates a 2015 state law that says solicitations involving a fake
   check must have "clearly and conspicuously printed in at least 18-point
   type: 'SPECIMEN-NON-NEGOTIABLE.'" The Cruz campaign is headquartered in
   Texas.

   "This is the kind of mail my legislation was trying to prevent," said
   state Rep. Gene Wu (D). "It certainly breaks the spirit of the law, and
   I agree that the Texas' Consumer Protection Division should look into
   whether or not it breaks the letter of the law, as well. Texas
   consumers should not be tricked into sending anyone their money,
   especially to elected officials."

   during Hagel's confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington.
   Weeks into his job, Texas Republicans are cheering Cruz's indelicate
   debut and embracing him as one of their own. The insurgent Republican
   elected with the tea party's blessing and bankroll, has run afoul of
   GOP mainstays, and prompted Democrats to compare his style to
   McCarthyism. Also seen from left are Sen.s Roy Blunt, R-Mo., and Mike
   Lee, R-Utah. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)
