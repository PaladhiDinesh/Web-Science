   How many more stories are we going to have to read about veterans who
   have been denied benefits from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
   before we become angry enough to do something once and for all to
   demand that the VA be fixed?

   As I write this, I’m wondering if anyone other than veterans will care
   that another veteran and hero may never receive what he is owed for his
   military service.

   Have we become numb to the issues of veterans because they just seem
   insurmountable? Are we willing to let another veteran down while the VA
   process keeps him tied up in paperwork?

   [27]Emil Limpert, now in [28]his 90s, served in the Philippines in 1944
   and was wounded in a foxhole while fighting off a Japanese attack in
   World War II.

   Limpert describes what happened in the foxhole that day and the guys
   that fought alongside him.

   “There were four guys in there, and two guys got killed. And then the
   other guy, he got his leg, oh hell I guess he lost his leg. It was slit
   in four places where a grenade hit between us and I got one in my leg,”
   [29]Limpert said.

   He recalls also receiving medical treatment in a makeshift jungle tent
   and returning back to his unit to continue fighting. It wasn’t until a
   few years after the war ended, that he discovered his was still
   carrying some mortar shrapnel in his leg.

   Limpert went to the [30]VA Hospital in St. Louis and was referred to
   [31]Jefferson Barracks Division, also in St. Louis, where “most” of the
   metal was removed. Limpert decided not to apply for benefits then but
   believes he may be entitled to receive benefits for the injuries he
   suffered.

   “I thought well, as long as I’m working I’ll pay for it myself rather
   than argue with ‘em. Well now I’ve got nothing left,” [32]Limpert said.
   “We got rid of our car, we got rid of our house. I got rid of money I
   had in bonds and stocks and now I need help.”

   Limpert’s financial situation [33]changed when he and his wife of 70
   years, who is also in her 90s, began running out of money. They are
   currently in need of financial assistance so that they may stay in the
   assisted living facility where they currently reside.

   None of that seems to matter to the VA who notified Limpert after two
   months that he would need to provide more proof that he had actually
   served in the military.

   “I get this letter, says we can’t accept it because we’ve got no record
   of you being in the service,” [34]Limpert said, incredulously.

   Apparently, two bronze stars and a purple heart he was awarded for his
   service, his discharge papers, a roster of those injured in the attack
   with him and the X-ray taken of his leg after he returned home is not
   sufficient to prove [35]Limpert served his country.

   Really?

   This isn’t the first time that the VA has made veterans jump through
   seemingly unnecessary hoops to receive the benefits they earned while
   serving their country.

   Another World War II veteran, [36]Stanley Friedman, was denied benefits
   for 67 years because the VA failed to locate documents to prove that he
   had served his country. He was only able to enjoy three-and-a-half
   years of disability benefits before dying at the age of 94. Without the
   assistance of pro bono attorneys, Friedman may never have seen a dime
   that was owed him.

   Limpert is one of many veterans who had their [37]records destroyed
   during a massive fire in [38]St. Louis on July 12, 1973. The fire
   destroyed 16 to 18 million official military personnel records that
   were only kept in paper form, years before computer databases
   permanently stored the information. As a result, veterans who were
   unable to reproduce proof of injuries or even their service in the
   military were denied benefits from the VA.

   Limpert’s story is not unlike the stories I have heard from veterans I
   spoke with across the country while assisting TheBlaze Radio talk show
   hosts from [39]The Morning Blaze with Doc & Skip in their quest to fix
   the VA.

   Screenshot

   Many veterans told me that they waited months and sometimes longer to
   hear back from the VA once their application for disability had been
   filed. One veteran told me that after his long wait he was told he
   needed to resubmit the same paperwork he had originally filed. No
   explanation was given.

   Veterans also shared that the evaluation process to determine what if
   anything the VA would pay out in disability benefits for claimed
   injuries was also a long process. For one veteran, his evaluation
   process took 20 months to complete. At the end of it, he was initially
   denied benefits for numerous physical injuries that he had sustained
   while serving in the U.S. Army.

   Long-term solutions are needed to fix the VA. However, Limpert is not a
   young man with years ahead of him to wait until the VA gets their act
   together. He is in his 90s and time is of the essence.

   If ever there was a case for the public to start a crowd funding
   account to help Limpert and his wife, this is it.

   Limpert has reached out to Sen. Claire McCaskill’s office for help in
   resolving the matter but because of Limpert’s financial situation and
   age, McCaskill’s help may not prove to be timely.

   However, I call on one presidential candidate in particular to help
   Limpert.

   Presidential candidate Donald Trump has campaigned on the promise that
   he will help veterans if elected. However, Trump is in a position to
   help Limpert now with the [41]$6 million he recently raised for
   veterans in Iowa. Limpert needs that money today and he claims he has
   ample evidence to prove that he is a veteran.

   Don’t let this World War II veteran be denied what he is owed! He needs
   help today!
