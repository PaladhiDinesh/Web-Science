   The statements of one man above all have pushed the media to call a lie
   a lie when first reported.

   The Donald’s whoppers have turned the media focus from gaffes—the fuel
   of election coverage past—to lies. Michael Kinsley applauds—but wonders
   if it will matter.

   Ann Romney gave the game away four years ago. Not that it was any
   secret, but the wife of the Republican presidential contender in 2012
   spelled it all out in a way that should have been embarrassing to
   everyone involved in politics.

   A Democratic political operative named Hilary Rosen had commented
   publicly in a CNN interview with Anderson Cooper that Ann Romney “never
   worked a day in her life.” This overlooked the fact that, as a
   homemaker, Romney had successfully raised five nearly identical,
   Wasp-perfect sons. Five out of five—it almost defies the laws of
   physics. Republicans leapt on Rosen’s remark as an insult to women who
   had chosen to stay home and raise a family rather than pursue a career
   in the workforce. This is a substantial bloc of voters, especially in
   the Republican Party. It was Ann Romney’s role in this staged melodrama
   to be deeply offended and hurt by Rosen’s remark. But she missed her
   cue and instead she called Rosen’s comment an “early birthday present.”

   This was a “gaffe”—a word that barely exists outside the world of
   politics but has come to be the principal mechanism by which
   politicians and the press keep things moving along. Hilary Rosen’s
   comment, which led to Ann Romney’s comment, was also a gaffe. As we all
   know, a gaffe is when a politician tells the truth. (“If I hear that
   line one more time, I’ll scream,” says Arianna. A pause. “Darling,” she
   adds.) Or, more subtly, a gaffe occurs when a politician or someone in
   the political world departs from the script and accidentally says
   what’s really on his or her mind. Ann Romney revealed that she was not
   hurt or distressed but delighted that a prominent Democrat had
   committed a gaffe. A feigned dynamic is central to the gaffe-o-rama
   that American politics has become—which in turn plays to the growing
   role of umbrage in many corners of American culture.

   A variant on outright umbrage is the “sorrow, not anger” ploy—the
   pretense that the supposed victim of a gaffe is not enraged but deeply
   saddened. “Saddened” suggests a certain dignity and seriousness: You
   are far too big a person to take offense at your opponent’s offensive
   remark. You are just saddened that his or her pathetic insensitivity
   should drive him or her to such depths of depravity and gaffery.

   This election season, a rival has arisen to challenge the gaffe as the
   essential fuel that keeps politics chugging along. It’s known as the
   lie. A “lie” is a much more straightforward matter than a gaffe. In
   recent elections, gaffes have been given far more attention than lies:
   John Kerry saying he was for the Iraq war before he was against it;
   Mitt Romney effectively defining 47 percent of the electorate as
   freeloaders. But in the past year, “fact-checking,” which had begun to
   get real traction in 2008, has become all the rage among the media.
   This is an excellent development, which I am not here to mock. But if I
   were here to mock it, I might point out the triviality or irrelevance
   of many lies that become issues in the campaign. Does it really matter
   whether Marco Rubio’s parents came to America in 1959 (fleeing Castro’s
   revolution in Cuba, as he claimed for years) or in 1956 (well before
   the revolution, as he eventually admitted)? Well, yes, it does matter,
   though only because if he lied about this, then it says something about
   his character. But does it say enough to justify the time taken away
   from discussion of what to do about Iranian nukes or income inequality?
   As coverage of campaign mechanics and trifling details becomes more
   pervasive, coverage of issues a president will actually have to deal
   with is crowded out. Publications such as Politico (confession: I used
   to work there; it’s a swell place) and an infinity of Web sites and
   cable-TV shows have all raised the importance of trivia.

   As gaffes recede in importance, the old-fashioned untruth is making a
   comeback. Something to celebrate?
   Illustration by Barry Blitt.

   So, the role of the gaffe is receding. The old-fashioned lie is making
   a comeback. Question for today: Is this a good thing or a bad thing?
   It’s actually a puzzle to me why anyone takes gaffes seriously at all.
   Why shouldn’t the words that a candidate has carefully crafted be
   considered a more accurate reflection of actual opinion and character
   than the words uttered by accident? This must arise from a belief that,
   while a lie is by definition purposeful, a gaffe has accidentally
   bubbled up from some unattractive (or incompetent) part of the
   speaker’s brain over which his campaign manager has no control.

   A deliberate lie is worse than an accidental gaffe. Lies by politicians
   are inevitable, and it has taken Donald Trump—with his claim that
   thousands of people in New Jersey (with its “heavy Arab population”)
   cheered the destruction of the Twin Towers; with his claim that 81
   percent of white murder victims are killed by blacks; and with a lot
   more—to push the American media to call a lie a lie when first
   reported, rather than let it sit there uncontested until the second
   wave, that of “analysis,” comes along. (“Analysis” is newspaper code
   for “this is the real skinny—just ignore all of our earlier stuff.”)
   But there are lies and then there are lies. Magazines have always had
   fact-checkers—overworked, underpaid, and often amazingly attractive
   (it’s best to stay on their good side)—who excel at finding mistakes by
   a writer before an article appears. But it isn’t even their job to
   correct deliberate lies by the subject of a piece.

   Any analysis of lying and its role in democracy must pause to consider
   what is probably the greatest lie ever to grace our politics: Bill
   Clinton’s magnificent “I did not have sexual relations with that
   woman,” of 1998. It’s worthy of study by anyone with political
   ambitions (though not just anyone could pull it off). This lie had
   everything. Above all, it was an actual attempt to mislead people on a
   concrete question of fact—and, for a time, it even worked. Most
   political lies are not intended to actually change anyone’s mind. It’s
   usually too late for that. Ordinary political lies are merely intended
   to sow confusion and sprinkle a bit of doubt. If lying politicians can
   supply a reed to their own supporters who are grasping for one, the job
   will have been done.

   A great political lie should not be complicated. Subject matter is
   important. A run-of-the-mill lie may concern itself with some minor or
   ancient indiscretion. A somewhat grander lie will be about a matter of
   policy, such as saying you have always supported Medicare when as a
   governor you opposed it. Taking the hard way—the eastern ascent of
   Everest—is what turns a good lie into a masterpiece. The subject will
   return from policy to the personal. At its best, it will involve
   sex—or, rather, as Clinton would have it, it will not involve sex.
   Or—and this is the truly glorious part of his lie—whether or not it
   involves sex will become the very issue. A great political lie, when it
   works, performs triple duty. It deceives people about the subject at
   hand. It deceives people about the character of the politician in
   question. And it provides a distraction.

   It is good to be focusing on lies again, because our next president
   will be a liar. How do I know? Every candidate who survives into
   election year is a proven liar. Maybe Lincoln Chafee or (is it
   possible?) Rick Perry has never told a conscious, knowing lie. Where
   are they now? But Hillary Clinton has, and so have all those
   Republicans, including, of course, Donald Trump. Still, I would rather
   have a congenital gaffer as president than a congenital liar. It would
   be nice not to have to make the choice.

   In this photo from 1976, Trump shows off plans for the future Grand
   Hyatt on East 42nd Street to a city official. Considering the era and
   the man, this is a remarkably tasteful, organic-looking hairstyle.
   Nevertheless, the hard-charging young developer appears to be studying
   the older man’s pate-management techniques with an eye, as always, to
   the future.
