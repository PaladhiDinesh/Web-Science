   An exclusive Mitchell FOX 2 Detroit Poll of Michigan finds that Donald
   Trump and Hillary Clinton both are holding a sizable lead on their
   opponents.

   The exclusive poll shows Trump holds a 2:1 lead over Marco Rubio and
   Ted Cruz in Michigan. Trump has 41% with Rubio and Cruz picking up 20%
   and 16%, respectively. The three leading candidates are followed by Dr.
   Ben Carson (9%), former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (2%), and New Jersey Gov.
   Chris Christie (2%).

   The IVR (Interactive Voice Response) automated survey of 330 likely
   March 2016 Michigan Republican Presidential Primary voters was
   conducted by Mitchell Research & Communications on February 4, 2016 and
   has a Margin of Error of + or –5.39% at the 95% level of confidence.

   On the Democratic side, Clinton also holds a 2:1 lead over Bernie
   Sanders. She has 57% with Sanders standing at 28%, both sides lost
   support since the last poll with Clinton losing 4% and Sanders 6%.

   The IVR survey of 321 likely March 2016 Michigan Democratic
   Presidential Primary voters was conducted by Mitchell Research &
   Communications February 4, 2016. The poll has a Margin of Error of + or
   – 5.47% at the 95% level of confidence.

   “Rubio was riding on a crest of positive press from his strong Iowa
   showing. However, his debate performance Saturday night may hurt him in
   New Hampshire, allowing some of the governors like Kasich, Bush, or
   Christie to move up. What happens in New Hampshire will impact
   Michigan, just as Iowa did. Trump has a strong lead in Michigan and New
   Hampshire and if he wins in the Granite State, he will likely stay on
   top here,” Mitchell concluded. “Despite difficulties in New Hampshire,
   Clinton looks very strong in Michigan at this time. She is especially
   strong with women where she leads by 40% compared t just 11% with men.
   She is tied with voters under 50, but has a strong lead with older
   voters. She is also very strong with African-Americans.”
