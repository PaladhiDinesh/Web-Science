   The conventional business news this week will be dominated by earnings,
   as a raft of high-profile companies report. But the week’s most
   important news for business leaders may not be found on the business
   pages (print or digital). Consider:

   -Tuesday. The New Hampshire primary. At this point, what can I or
   anyone say that hasn’t been said? But one insight at least deserves
   emphasizing: The consequences of the presidential election will be
   profound for business, and the way things are going, they could be
   transformational. My colleague [30]Alan Murray explains why in his CEO
   Daily this morning, which I highly recommend. Although it seems
   inconceivable, and is still highly unlikely, the consequences for your
   business of a President Trump or a President Sanders are worth your
   pondering for a moment. They’ll both probably win on Tuesday.

   -Wednesday. NATO defense ministers meet for two days in Brussels to
   discuss the alliance’s defenses on its “eastern flank,” meaning Russia.
   President Vladimir Putin is a desperate man as his corrupt, oil-based
   economy declines, and he learned in Ukraine that aggressive
   belligerence works wonders for his popularity at home. If NATO decides
   to strengthen its defenses, perhaps in the Baltics and elsewhere, will
   he feel the need to respond in some highly visible way? If tension with
   Russia ratchets up, the EU economy – as a unit, the world’s largest
   economy – could weaken just as it’s finally starting to grow. Your
   business would feel the consequences.

   leaders and leadership.

   -Wednesday and Thursday. Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen testifies to House
   and Senate committees. As speculation grows that her minuscule December
   rate increase may be it for the year, the world will be listening for
   new information or hints. If she still seems to feel that a
   quarter-point rise—as former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson describes
   it, “from almost nothing to a little more than almost nothing”—is all
   the economy can bear, that’s grim news.

   -Thursday. Defense Secretary Ash Carter leads a meeting of defense
   ministers from countries in the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS. The
   topic: whether to extend operations into Libya. As a nation in chaos
   with lots of oil, it’s an ideal new base for ISIS as it loses ground in
   Iraq and Syria. But would intervening actually disrupt the eventual
   formation of a government in Libya? More broadly, which would be worse
   for the world economy – escalating the conflict or letting ISIS operate
   freely?

   The most important news for business isn’t always called business news,
   as this week emphatically shows.
