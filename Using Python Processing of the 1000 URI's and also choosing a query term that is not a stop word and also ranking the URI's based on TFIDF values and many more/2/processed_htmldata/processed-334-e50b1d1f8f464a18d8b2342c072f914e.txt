       My husband was looking at earrings for me, but I’d prefer to get a
       ring. He hasn’t bought me any jewelry since my engagement ring 6
       years ago.

       Well, “the holiday’s” are over. But I’m really wanting these
       expensive colored pencils that I’ve been eyeing. Probably won’t
       happen, though, as they’re seriously, ridiculously, expensive!
