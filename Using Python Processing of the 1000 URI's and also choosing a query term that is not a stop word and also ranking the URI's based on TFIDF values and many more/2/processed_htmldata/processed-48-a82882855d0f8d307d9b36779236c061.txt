   Police released this sketch of the red-haired robbery suspect.Photo:

   Cops say they cuffed the red-haired crook connected with a string of
   robberies on and off the subway.

   Officers found Che Quenten Irving, 20, of Harlem, sprawled across a few
   seats on a northbound A train near the 145th Street station, with an
   open Heineken in his hand at about 2 a.m. Saturday. The officers, who
   recognized Irving from a surveillance image, also found two gravity
   knives in his possession.

   He was quickly charged with criminal possession of a weapon, as well as
   two violations for carrying an open beer on the train. About 13 hours
   later, he was charged with robbery in connection with three other
   incidents, two on the subway and one in a store.

   The first happened on last Sunday about 8:30 p.m. when cops said Irving
   approached a 22-year-old man on a northbound C train near the West
   155th Street station, displayed a knife and demanded his cell phone,
   according to cops, who then allegedly slashed the victim’s right arm
   and fled empty-handed.

   On Wednesday at about 7:50 p.m., Irving also grabbed an iPad from a
   28-year-old woman’s hand on a C train in West Harlem, police said.

   About a half-hour earlier, Irving allegedly snatched two bags of chips
   from a shelf at Spring Iconic Sweet Shop in SoHo. A 39-year-old
   employee struggled with Irving, attempting to stop him, but he managed
   to get away with the chips.
