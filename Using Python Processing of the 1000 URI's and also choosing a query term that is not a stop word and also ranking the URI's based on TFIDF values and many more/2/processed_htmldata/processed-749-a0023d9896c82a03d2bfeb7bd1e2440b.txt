   WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump has given a list of reasons for his
   second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses, including a failure to invest
   in boosting voter-turnout and claiming that Ted Cruz "stole" the win.
   But with voting fast approaching in New Hampshire, data from political
   advertising tracker Kantar Media reveal another possible explanation:
   Trump got pummeled on TV.

   And while the billionaire has been stepping up his campaign ground game
   and events in New Hampshire, Trump appears to be giving other
   candidates the opportunity there — and in South Carolina, the following
   primary state — to make the same kind of political-advertising assault
   that ramped up in Iowa.

   Cruz attacked him. A political group poured $1 million into negative
   ads. Even Ben Carson tucked in a subtle jab.

   During the 10-day period leading up to the Feb. 1 caucus, seven of
   every 10 broadcast TV ad spots that mentioned Trump in Iowa either
   attacked him or compared him negatively to another candidate, according
   to an Associated Press analysis of broadcast television political ads.
   In total, Republican candidates and super PACs ran at least 16
   different television ads attacking Trump that aired nearly 2,500 times.

   Trump faced a heavy onslaught of negative ads from Cruz's campaign and
   the Cruz-aligned super PAC Stand for Truth. The Our Principles PAC also
   bombarded Trump with more than $1.1 million in TV ads by largely using
   Trump's own words against him — including old interviews where he said
   he didn't like abortion but still considered himself pro-choice.

   For comparison, Trump himself aired one ad called "Clear Difference"
   about 1,000 times. That ad attacks Cruz, a Republican senator from
   Texas, for his stance on immigration and compares Trump favorably.
   Trump's other ad — a positive spot featuring a campaign speech — aired
   fewer than 25 times.

   "What we saw in Iowa, that was probably a failure of ground game and
   television," said Kyle Kondik, the managing editor of Sabato's Crystal
   Ball, a non-partisan election newsletter run by the University of
   Virginia.

   In an interview with the AP on Friday, Trump said he was learning as he
   goes along. He said he now knew to invest more in turnout and would
   defend himself robustly from future attacks — though he'll only spend
   money if it's actually needed.

   "I've spent the least amount of money of any candidate, and I'm No. 1
   in the polls," Trump said. "That's called good business skills."

   With the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, Trump has spent about $3.6
   million on TV and radio ads there. But Trump's spending trails his
   next-closest competitor: Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio has spent $4.8
   million in New Hampshire, and has benefited from an additional $8.1
   million in ads from the Rubio-aligned Conservative Solutions PAC.

   Rubio has also spent heavily on ads in South Carolina, data show, where
   the Cruz-aligned Keep the Promise I PAC has been running ads attacking
   Trump.

   Trump's $750,000 of broadcast advertising in South Carolina buys to
   date leaves him the eighth biggest spender among the candidates and
   conservative PACs. And with about two weeks until the third primary
   contest, Trump has only booked about $7,500 in future airtime — a small
   amount compared to the $2.2 million reserved by Rubio and the $1.1
   million by Cruz-aligned Stand for Truth PAC.

   Trump said he'd spend more if he felt that he needed to, calling his
   campaign "$45 million under budget" in an interview with the AP. But
   advertising hasn't been key to the race so far, he said.

   "I see Bush spending $100 million," Trump said, "and I've spent
   practically nothing."
