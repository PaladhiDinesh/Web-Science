   SponsoredPostDisclaimer New year, new you – right?

   2016 has been off to a great start. I try to avoid new year’s
   resolutions but I always start the year with a fresh mind and new
   ideas. Those ideas are always packed full with ways I’m going to
   improve. Like many people, health was on the top of my list.  My
   husband and I work out weekly and eat fairly healthy. We aren’t on any
   crazy diets but we know our limits with sweets and fried food.

   Since we still want to enjoy food and not feel like we need to live at
   the gym, we’ve made a few tweaks to our diet. I already cook everyday,
   I’ve been putting an effort on cooking with more whole foods and making
   better decisions like swapping out the fried food for veggies.

   After evaluating my diet, I realized I was not getting enough protein.
   Protein is crucial for your body. A  few things protein does is reduce
   muscle loss, builds lean muscle, curbs hunger and helps you maintain a
   healthy weight.  My husband drinks protein shakes daily and I always
   figured I didn’t need it since he works out more than me. (I know that
   sounds crazy, but that’s that I thought.)

   My husband makes his shakes with [24]Iovate Protein and I thought I
   would give it a try after learning how much protein will help my body.
   He loves shakes but I wanted something that didn’t take a lot of effort
   and that I could take with me when I’m on the go. My solution? Protein
   Bars! So easy, so simple!

   I made a recipe that you don’t have to bake and that includes
   ingredients that are probably already sitting in your pantry!

No Bake Chocolate Coconut Protein Bars NO Bake Chocolate Coconut Protein Bars

   Ingredients:
     * 1 cup oats, ground into a flour
     * 1/2 cup quick oats
     * 1/3 cup [25]Purely Inspired French Vanilla Protein Powder
     * 1/2 cup cereal – anything that will give it a crunch
     * 3/4 cup peanut butter (or almond butter)
     * 1/3 cup honey
     * 1 tsp. vanilla extract

   Directions:

   Prepare a 2 Quart pan by laying down wax paper. Set aside. In a
   medium-sized mixing bowl, combine all dry ingredients (Oat flour, quick
   oats, protein powder, and cereal). Mix until well combined and set
   aside. Homemade Chocolate Coconut Protein Bars In a small microwavable
   dish, add almond butter and honey, stirring until the peanut butter is
   melted and fully combined with the honey. Stir in vanilla extract. Mix
   the dry ingredients with the wet ingredients. Stir until everything is
   fully combined. No Bake Protein Bars Pour all ingredients into the pan.
   Using a spatula, the back of a spoon or your hands, spread the mixture
   evenly in the pan, pressing down firmly No Bake Protein Bars

   Place pan into fridge and allow to cool for approximately 30 minutes
   before cutting into bars. Once the bars have set, gently pull the wax
   paper up releasing the bars from the pan.  No Bake Protein Bars Cut the
   mixture into bars using a sharp knife.  No Bake Protein Bars Top the
   protein bars with any ingredients you would like. I melted chocolate
   morsels and poured over each bar then sprinkled with coconut.  No Bake
   Protein Bars

   Once you’re finished topping your protein bars, you’re ready to eat
   them! If you’re like me, you snacked on them while you were making
   them. They are so good they’re hard to resist. NO Bake Protein Bars

   If you don’t have time to make these bars, you can always add the
   protein to many other recipes. Purely Inspired Protein is the
   only  truly organic USDA approved plant-based protein powder and it has
   no artificial coloring or flavors. I love that there is a vanilla and
   chocolate option. You can’t beat such an amazing protein for only
   $19.97 at Walmart.

   If you don’t want to make anything with your protein, you can always
   drink it with water. My husband does this often! If you would prefer to
   buy protein bars that are already made, check out [26]Mission1™ bars.
   These bars have no artificial ingredients and come in lots of great
   flavors (Cookies & Cream, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, Chocolate
   Brownie). You can buy a box – 4 pack ($6.94) OR can buy an individual
   bar ($1.84).
