Story highlights

     * Trump said of refugees, "I can look at their faces and say, 'Look
       you can't come here'"
     * Trump struck a markedly different tone in addressing tough
       questions from a town hall audience

   Salem, New Hampshire (CNN)Donald Trump asserted Monday that as
   president he could face Syrian refugee children and tell them they
   cannot come to the United States.

   The remark came Monday as Trump took about a dozen questions during a
   town hall event that drew just over 200 voters -- an
   uncharacteristically intimate setting for Trump -- just a day before
   the New Hampshire primary.

   "I can look at their faces and say, 'Look, you can't come here,'" Trump
   said after 30 year-old Darren Ornitz of Greenwich, Connecticut, asked
   the billionaire businessman -- who owns a home there -- whether he
   would be willing to personally bar Syrian children from resettling
   there.

   "Their parents should always stay with them. But we don't know where
   their parents come from. We have no documentation whatsoever," Trump
   continued. "There's absolutely no way of saying where these people come
   from."

   Trump went on, suggesting that Syrian refugees have pictures of ISIS
   flags "and worse" on their cell phones.

   But beyond that, Trump struck a markedly different tone in addressing
   his questioner.

   Trump didn't castigate the man, instead opting for empathy.

   "I know what you're doing and I fully understand it. And we all have a
   heart," Trump said, adding again at the end of his response: "I
   understand where you're coming from, but there is a second view to
   that."

   Trump also argued that the creation of safe zones in Syria to host
   refugees would be a better solution to address the refugee crisis
   spawned by the Syrian civil war.

   "You look at it and you say we have enough problems," Trump said. "I
   have a bigger heart than anybody in this room. We take an area in Syria
   ... and we build a safe zone."

   But Ornitz, who came to New Hampshire to attend different events with
   different presidential candidates, said in an interview after the event
   that while Trump's "human side" emerged, he was "not at all" satisfied
   with the response.

   "The idea of being able to actually look at a child and say, 'You're
   not actually able to come live in my community because of political
   reasons,' or whatever, is just very off and it doesn't make us safer,
   it doesn't help anyone else. It just perpetuates issues of division and
   discrimination and so I wasn't happy with his answer at all," said
   Ornitz, who told CNN he is leaning toward supporting Sen. Bernie
   Sanders in the Democratic primary.

   "His policies toward the issue are terrible and I really wish he would
   connect more with what he really thinks," he added.

   Trump took questions for nearly an hour from voters on a range of other
   issues -- from equal pay for women to corruption in government service
   to nuclear weapons.

   But in characteristic Trump fashion, he give a direct response.

   Asked about national service and later student debt, Trump noted the
   importance of the question before saying "we're going to look at it
   very seriously," and "I'm going to find a way that we're going to stop
   it."

   When a 13-year-old told Trump he was concerned about the mounting
   national debt's impact on his future, Trump said he would address the
   issue and then simply sought to reassure the boy.

   "Don't worry about it. Just go to school, get a good education, you'll
   be happy when you graduate," Trump said.
