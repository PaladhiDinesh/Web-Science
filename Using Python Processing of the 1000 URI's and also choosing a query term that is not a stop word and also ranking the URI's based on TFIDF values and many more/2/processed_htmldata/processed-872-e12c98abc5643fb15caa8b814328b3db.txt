Story at-a-glance +

     * McDonald’s sells 75 hamburgers every second, amounting to over 2.36
       billion burgers per year – roughly the equivalent of eating a
       million cows
     * However, there have been disturbing reports of McDonald’s
       hamburgers that do not decompose or rot for weeks, months, or even
       years after they’ve been cooked
     * In March 2015, McDonald’s announced that they are going to be
       buying only chicken raised without antibiotics important to human
       medicine; However, they still do not have plans to make any changes
       to their meat, which come from factory farms or confined animal
       feeding operations (CAFOs)
     * Just like its hamburgers, McDonald’s Chicken McNuggets and McRib
       pork sandwich also came under fire because of their questionable
       synthetic ingredients; McDonald’s fries sold in American stores
       were also found to contain toxic ingredients

   By Dr. Mercola

     When talking about fast food giants, nothing can be bigger – and
     more infamous – than McDonald's. Those two "golden arches" sign are
     so abundant and so well-known all over the world, that some toddlers
     can even recognize it even before they are able to speak full
     sentences.
     In 2014, over 36,258 McDonald's restaurants operate worldwide,^[73]1
     serving over 69 million people every day. From its humble beginnings
     in the 1940s, the brand has now grown to be a multi-billion dollar
     company with an estimated value of over $85 billion.

     And the fast food's most popular menu item? The burgers.

     According to The Fiscal Times, McDonald's sells 75 burgers every
     second.^[74]2 That amounts to over 2.36 billion burgers per year –
     roughly the equivalent of eating a million cows.^[75]3

     For many people, nothing seems wrong with eating a McDonald's
     hamburger. After all, it looks and tastes the same as other burger
     patties, and the added convenience makes it a much sought-after meal
     for busy people, those who are on-the-go, or those who simply do not
     have time to cook food at home.

     But considering just how much burger patties are sold per day,
     haven't you ever wondered just how McDonald's hamburgers are made
     and, more importantly, what they're made of?

     Even more disturbing are the reports of McDonald's burgers that do
     not decompose or rot for weeks, months, or even years after they've
     been cooked.

McDonald's Hamburger Shows No Signs of Decomposition – Even After a Decade

     There have been multiple stories going viral about McDonald's
     hamburgers that show no signs of rotting or molding. One example is
     that of David Whipple, a man from Utah, who came forward in 2013,
     claiming that he had a McDonald's hamburger that dates back to 1999
     – but is yet to show any sign of decomposition.^[76]4

     Whipple initially bought the burger to keep for two weeks and show
     to his friends, but then forgot about it. Two years later, he found
     it in his coat pocket, with the original receipt, with no signs of
     rotting or mold. He decided to keep it to see how long it will
     disintegrate. According to ABC News website:^[77]5

     "'The patty feels like concrete,' Whipple said of the burger he has
     held onto for 14 years, first on purpose, then by accident, and then
     for a good laugh. Whipple… was living in Logan, Utah, and trying to
     lose weight when he first purchased the hamburger to prove to his
     friends that fast food was not real food.

     'It was nothing real scientific,' Whipple said. 'We were talking
     about enzymes and we knew what a good food like a banana would do
     but weren't sure what a hamburger would do.'

     Two weeks later, Whipple got his answer. The burger's pickles and
     onion toppings had begun to shrink but the bun and hamburger 'looked
     exactly the same,' he said.

     Whipple was invited to guest on the TV show The Doctors to talk
     about his experience. He said he uses the burger to encourage his
     grandkids to eat healthy and avoid fast food.

     I've featured stories about these "everlasting McDonald's burgers"
     on my site many years ago, like that of Manhattan artist Sally
     Davies' "[78]The Happy Meal Project," where she photographed a
     McDonald's Happy Meal every day for six months. (You can view the
     full photostream^[79]6 on her website.)

     Karen Hanrahan, a wellness educator and nutrition consultant, also
     claimed to have kept a McDonald's hamburger since 1996. It still
     looks as fresh as a newly bought one.

A Closer Look at a McDonald's Hamburger Ingredients

     According to McDonald's website,^[80]7 the only ingredient in its
     hamburger is 100 percent pure USDA-Inspected beef, prepared with
     grill seasoning (salt and black pepper) and without fillers and
     extenders.

     The fast food chain also refutes speculations that an "unknown"
     preservative is among their McDonald's hamburger ingredients, and
     says that their burgers and buns do not decompose simply because
     they "become very dry in the cooking and toasting process."
     According to a Business Insider article:^[81]8

     "…the patty loses water in the form of steam during the cooking
     process. The bun, of course, is made out of bread. Toasting it
     reduces the amount of moisture. This means that after preparation,
     the hamburger is fairly dry. When left out open in the room, there
     is further water loss as the humidity within most buildings is
     around 40%. So in the absence of moisture or high humidity, the
     hamburger simply dries out, rather than rot."

     Indeed, part of the embalmed-like feature of the meat patty can be
     because of its high-sodium content. Salt is a natural preservative
     that has been used throughout history.

     But you have to admit that something that does not decompose, or
     even show signs of decomposing after days, months, or years seems
     very, very suspicious. After all, the hallmark of live food is that
     it wilts and decomposes – something that, apparently, does not occur
     in these burgers.

     In 2014, McDonald's attempted to clear its name by releasing a
     video,^[82]9 which starred former MythBusters co-host Grant Imahara
     and filmed in a Cargill facility in Fresno, California, that shows
     just how McDonald's hamburger patties are made.^[83]10 It aims to
     debunk the myth that McDonald's uses fillers, additives, and
     preservatives in their meat – showing instead large beef chunks on a
     conveyor belt going through a machine that forms them into patties.

     They also asserted that they do not use pink slime in their meat.
     Pink slime is a sludge-like ingredient made of ground-up beef
     "trimmings" – various beef scraps and cow connective tissues – and
     ammonium hydroxide, which gives the mixture its pink hue. McDonald's
     has admitted to using pink slime in their hamburgers before, but had
     discontinued it in 2011.

McDonald's Plans to Make the 'Big Switch' to Antibiotic-Free Chicken

     In March 2015, McDonald's announced that they are going to be buying
     only chicken raised without antibiotics important to human medicine
     – a change that would take place in over the next two years. They
     also claimed that they would begin using milk from cows that have
     not been treated with the artificial growth hormone rBST.

     While this is positive news, I believe that McDonald's only made the
     decision to help improve their slumping US sales. Many restaurants
     like Panera Bread, Chipotle, and Shake Shack have already switched
     to antibiotic-free poultry and meat, causing their former customers
     to flock to these competitors.

     This change means that not only will suppliers be scrambling to meet
     the demand, but other fastfood chains will also be considering a
     similar move.

     But although going antibiotic-free on their poultry is a step in the
     right direction, I don't think we should be celebrating any time
     soon, because McDonald's is yet to make any changes to its meat –
     which is actually loaded with a whole different host of problems…

McDonald's Beef Comes from Factory Farms

     Even if it is true that McDonald's burgers do not contain
     preservatives or additives (which I seriously doubt), this does not
     excuse the fact that McDonald's meat actually comes from confined
     animal feeding operations (CAFOs).
     Not only are cows and other livestock in these factory farms made to
     live in unsanitary and inhumane conditions, but they are also given
     antibiotics and growth hormones to make them grow faster and more
     resistant to disease. In fact, nearly 25 million pounds of
     antibiotics are administered to livestock in the US every year.

     These antibiotics, along with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, are
     transferred to you every time you eat CAFO meat – and sometimes even
     through the animal manure used as crop fertilizer. Two million
     Americans become infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria every
     year, causing at least 23,000 deaths.^[84]11

     What's worse, antibiotic-resistant disease is not the only danger
     brought on by CAFOs. Excessive exposure to antibiotics and regularly
     eating antibiotic-laced CAFO meats also harms your gastrointestinal
     health, predisposing you to virtually any disease.

     But it's not just the hamburger meat that's really problematic…

Here's Why McDonald's Bun Stays Mold-Free for Years

     McDonald's patty's long life may be because of its sodium content,
     but what about the bun? Bread typically stays fresh for several
     days, but have you ever heard of one that stays mold-free for years?
     Yet that's exactly what happened with the McDonald's bun.

     I believe that this is because McDonald's bun is lightyears away
     from freshly baked bread you make at home – in fact, it is a
     "bread-like" concoction that bears no actual resemblance to natural
     bread (except for its appearance, obviously). Just take a look at
     the ingredients used in McDonald's buns:

     "Enriched Bleached Flour (Wheat Flour, Malted Barley Flour, Niacin,
     Reduced Iron, Thiamin Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid), Water,
     High Fructose Corn Syrup, Yeast, Soybean Oil, Contains 2% or Less:
     Salt, Wheat Gluten, Leavening (Calcium Sulfate, Ammonium Sulfate),
     May Contain One or More Dough Conditioners (Sodium Stearoyl
     Lactylate, DATEM, Ascorbic Acid, Azodicarbonamide, Mono and
     Diglycerides, Monocalcium Phosphate, Enzymes, Calcium Peroxide),
     Calcium Propionate (Preservative)."

     These ingredients should clearly offer clues as to why the burgers
     stay blemish-free and "fresh" for years. But what's more alarming is
     that they can also open your eyes to the potential health
     ramifications you may experience if you eat a McDonald's hamburger.
     For example, calcium sulfate, also known as plaster of Paris, can
     possibly cause digestive problems. Meanwhile, ammonium sulfate is
     known to cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea due to
     gastrointestinal irritation.

Watch Out for These McDonald's Menu Items, Too

     Just like its hamburgers, McDonald's Chicken McNuggets also came
     under fire after it was found that only 50 percent of the nuggets is
     actually chicken. The other 50 percent is a mixture of corn
     derivatives, leavening agents, sugars, and completely synthetic
     ingredients that no sane person would ever think of cooking with.

     Its seasonal offering, the McRib pork sandwich, was also closely
     scrutinized. Apparently, one of its ingredients is azodicarbonamide,
     a chemical used to bleach the flour bread… but is also used in
     making gym shoes and yoga mats. And underneath the "tasty, tangy
     barbecue sauce," the researchers found that the pork was nothing
     more than restructured meat product – made from all the cheap
     innards and cast-offs of a pig. Not so appetizing anymore, is it?

     Even their fries, particularly those sold in the US, was also found
     to contain toxic ingredients. While French fries in the UK only are
     simply potatoes fried in sunflower or rapeseed oil, the fries that
     Americans get contain TBHQ; antifoaming agents, color stabilizers,
     and preservatives. They also contain beef flavor that's made with
     wheat and milk derivatives. This is why they carry an allergy
     warning for those with wheat and dairy sensitivities.

What Happens When You Eat an All-McDonald's Diet?

     You've probably heard of "SuperSize Me," a documentary where
     filmmaker Morgan Spurlock documented the consequences of eating a
     strictly McDonald's diet. After just four weeks of eating nothing
     but fast food, Spurlock's health had badly deteriorated to the point
     that his physician warned him to stop the experiment or he'll be
     putting his life in grave danger.

     Just recently, Tim Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology at
     King's College, London, wanted to learn what happens to your gut if
     you ate only McDonald's for 10 straight days. His son, Tom, agreed
     to do the experiment and sent stool samples to different labs
     throughout the 10-day period.

     The results were astounding. After just 10 days of eating fast food,
     his stool samples revealed that his gut microbes were "devastated" –
     about 40 percent of his bacteria species, amounting to over 1,400
     different types, were lost. This severe loss of microbial diversity
     is a risk factor to obesity and diabetes.

     Your gut is your second brain, and it is actually where 80 percent
     of your immune system lies. There are nearly 100 trillion bacteria,
     fungi, viruses, and other microorganisms, good and bad, that compose
     your body's microflora. These organisms play a crucial role in your
     mental and physical health, and if you upset this delicate balance,
     you become predisposed to a wide range of health problems.

Processed Foods Are a Bane to Your Health

     As I've often stressed in my articles, [85]processed foods and fast
     foods can absolutely wreak havoc on your health. Yes, they may be
     cheaper and more convenient, but they are excessively high in
     sugars, grains, and [86]factory farmed meats – a recipe for chronic
     diseases, such as obesity, [87]diabetes, and [88]heart disease.

     I advise you to stop glorifying processed foods and fast foods
     because of their taste and convenience. Instead, keep in mind ALL of
     the cons that they bring to your health, such as:
     * Loads your body with extra calories that do nothing for your body
     * Expose you to a toxic concoction of foreign chemicals and
       artificial flavors
     * Are a waste of money – in fact, they may even lead to increased
       healthcare bills for you and your loved ones
     * Can severely harm your children, whose bodies are still developing
       and are in greater need of nutrients

     I also recommend your diet to be composed of at least 90 percent
     non-processed, organic whole foods. Not only will you enjoy the
     health benefits, but you'll also be at peace as you know exactly
     what you're putting in your body.

Eat Healthy, Homemade Foods and Watch Your Health Soar

     I honestly believe that if you fail to plan, then you are planning
     to fail. Indeed, the secret to following a wholesome diet is
     learning to prepare your grocery list so you can plan your meals.
     Make it an essential part of your lifestyle. This would ideally
     involve scouting local farmers markets or food co-ops to buy
     in-season produce. Find a trustworthy source of grass-fed meats, raw
     dairy, and free-range chicken and eggs.

     Finally, appoint a person in your family to cook the meals. This
     should be someone who is willing to invest time in the kitchen.
