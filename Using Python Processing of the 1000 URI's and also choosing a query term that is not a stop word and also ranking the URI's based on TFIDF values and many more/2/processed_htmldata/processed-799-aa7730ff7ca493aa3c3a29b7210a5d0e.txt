   New Polls: Bernie Still Leads Big, Rubio Falls, Trump In Charge
   [22][Reuse options] Click here for reuse options!

   After Sen. Marco Rubio got hammered in ABC's New Hampshire GOP Debate,
   [23]his poll numbers began to slide:

     An internal poll conducted on Sunday suggests that Marco Rubio’s
     fumbled debate performance has damaged his prospects heading into
     the New Hampshire primary.

     The poll, conducted by the pro-John Kasich New Day for America Super
     PAC, shows Rubio plummeting to fourth place in the primary here,
     with 10 percent of the vote. Most of the polling conducted in the
     immediate days before the debate showed Rubio in second place.

     Donald Trump holds a wide lead in the survey, receiving 35 percent.
     He more than doubles runner-up Kasich, who has 15 percent. In third
     is Jeb Bush, with 13 percent. Behind Rubio in fifth and sixth place,
     respectively, are Christie and Ted Cruz. Both receive 8 percent.

   In a new [24]Monmouth poll, Bernie leads by ten points:

     For likely Democratic primary voters, the Monmouth survey found
     Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders held just a 10-point advantage over
     rival Hillary Clinton, 52-42 percent -- a slightly closer race than
     the 53-39 percent results from last month's poll.

     Sixty percent of likely voters said they were completely devoted to
     their candidate choice. Twenty-three percent stated a strong
     preference but still considered themselves open to a change of
     heart. Only seven percent had a "slight preference." Ten percent
     remain undecided.

   There still are a lot of undecided, but Hillary has a hill to climb.
   Trump still leads big, but Bush has climbed the most.

     According to a new Monmouth University survey released Sunday, Trump
     holds a considerable double-digit lead over his opponents, with 30
     percent of likely Republican primary voters saying they would vote
     for the billionaire businessman.

     Four candidates trail Trump in a virtual tie for second place: Ohio
     Gov. John Kasich garnered 14 percent support, Florida Sen. Marco
     Rubio earned 13 percent, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush also drew 13
     percent, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz had 12 percent support. Most
     candidates remained unchanged in their numbers from last month's
     Monmouth survey, except for Bush, who jumped nine points since
     January.

   ↓ Story continues below ↓

   In a new [25]7News/UMass Lowell NH Tracking Poll, Bernie leads by 16
   points.

     The Republicans are the big story...Because we know who's on top,
     but that's about all we know. The Democratic race is much easier to
     predict:

     Bernie Sanders is now beating Hillary Clinton by 16 points- 56% to
     40%, after he lost a point overnight, and she kept what she had.

     Undecided is up to 4%, an increase of two points since yesterday.
     The tracking poll shows Sanders is too far ahead of Clinton for her
     to catch him by Tuesday.

     All she can do now is try to cut the margin her loss.

   Although it's possible Hillary can cut into the lead, I think Bernie is
   a very safe bet to win in New Hampshire.

   In this poll, Trump is the big dog and even though Rubio hasn't fallen
   as far, his much ballyhooed momentum has definitely been blunted since
   Saturday's debate.

     Donald Trump stays in the top spot, with 34%, after dropping two
     points overnight.

     Then, a tie for second--at 13%--after Marco Rubio lost a point, and
     there was no change in Ted Cruz's support.

     John Kasich and Jeb Bush also are now tied, at 10%. Kasich gained
     one point...While Bush held steady.

     In the back of the GOP pack:

     Chris Christie gained a point, and is now at 5%; Carly Fiorina stays
     at four, and Ben Carson is stuck on three.

     And look at this number: Nine percent of Republican primary voters
     are undecided the day before polls open. The tracking poll gives you
     the picture: Donald Trump, alone on top. Then the cluster of Rubio,
     Cruz, Kasich, and Bush. All four of them are in the hunt for second
     and third place. The voters who are still undecided..

   Second and third place will be huge as the lower tiered candidates like
   Kasich, Bush and Christie are fighting for the political lives.

       "Think they'll bring up the speech from the 90's about the scary
       black men again?"
       Honestly, I think that's precisely the dog-whistle Chelsea Clinton
       is blowing on with her "worrying" comment. We know the Clinton's
       race bait with the best of them from the shit she pulled in '08.
       That comment by CC up their is a clear attempt to stoke racial
       fears. She might as well say "This Bernie guy wants to let all them
       black and latino super predators out to rape your daughters."

       So you weren't calling for his death or anything? This wasn't like
       your "Who will rid me of this turbulent ex-vice-president" moment?
       Well the obvious answer to your question would be he's already
       dead. Needs a wooden stake through the heart to keep this bastard
       down... but, alas, no heart.
