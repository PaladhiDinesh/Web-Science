Life without Walmart – Small towns struggle to cope

   [15]Life without Walmart – Small towns struggle to cope The loss of a
   Walmart in a small town could effectively mean the death of a town.

   Just ask Kimball, W. Va. woman Mary Francis Matney, who spoke to The
   Washington Post in a special report. In the 60-year-old eyes, her
   once-booming small town was already gutted by the disappearance of its
   mines. But when Kimball’s Walmart Supercenter was among the 154 to
   close down, that was akin to ringing the death bells for the town.
   According to Matney, the Supercenter’s closure had made “everyone so
   downhearted they don’t know what to do.”

   “It’s like we’re a forgotten bunch of people,” Matney continued. “It’s
   about all there was to look forward to. If we had to go any further,
   there ain’t no way. She then paused to check the half-off merchandise
   on the Walmart’s half-empty shelves as she continued speaking to the
   Post. “I hate seeing it die. I really do. You could always find better
   stuff here.”

   That interview took place just two days before the Kimball Walmart had
   closed. And, as the Post continued, its closure was so similar to the
   disappearance of other Walmarts in other small American towns. For
   example, the shutdown of the outlets in Fairfield, Alabama, Winnsboro,
   South Carolina, and Oriental, North Carolina had “left the community
   with few options for food.” And in Raymondville, Texas, city layoffs
   are expected with the “disappearance of tax income from Walmart.”

   One interesting aspect of the recent series of closures has been how
   Walmart tended to close stores that were within 10 miles of another
   branch, and stores in states with above-average square footage per
   capita. “It’s been part of the way these big retailers have tried to
   grab market share, by overbuilding markets and creating more retail
   space than they can support,” said Institute for Local Self-Reliance
   co-director Stacy Mitchell. “And, now that we have growing online
   sales, that overcapacity is going to get quite ugly.”

   For its part, Walmart said that there were a few factors it considered
   when choosing which stores to close, not the least of these being
   financial performance. However, Kimball’s residents aren’t buying that,
   citing the belief that its store always had a lot of customers.

   “They’ll never convince me it didn’t make money,” said Kimball resident
   Phyllis Noe. “I’ve always been fond of Wal-Mart, but they can’t look
   you in the eye and say they didn’t have good feedback. Maybe it’s just
   what they do: 10 years and then they leave.”

                                 [INS: :INS]
