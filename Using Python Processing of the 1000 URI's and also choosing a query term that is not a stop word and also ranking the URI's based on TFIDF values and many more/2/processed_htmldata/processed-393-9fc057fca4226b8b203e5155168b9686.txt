   Canton police are asking for help identifying this suspect, accused of
   exposing himself in a Walmart store.(Photo: Canton Police)

   Canton police are seeking help identifying a suspect accused of
   exposing himself to a woman inside the Walmart store on Michigan
   Avenue, near Belleville Road.

   Canton have released a photo of the suspect that was obtained from the
   store’s surveillance video.

   Detective Sgt. Dan Traylor has said the woman told police the man
   exposed himself to her about 3:30 a.m. Sunday, Jan. 31. She described
   him as a black male wearing a blue hooded sweatshirt.

   Anyone who has information is asked to call Canton police at
   734-394-5400.

   Pepper spray incident

   Employees and customers inside a McDonald’s restaurant said they began
   coughing and experiencing a burning sensation in their eyes after
   someone apparently released pepper spray inside the eatery at Michigan
   Avenue and Canton Center.

   A front-counter employee told police she heard a group of teenagers
   talking, with one asking the others, “What did you spray?”

   The incident happened shortly before 11 p.m. Saturday. The group of
   teens had left the restaurant before police arrived.

   No serious injuries were reported.

   Hunger games

   Three teens are in trouble after police say they went on an eating
   rampage in the Canton Walmart store on Michigan Avenue, without paying
   for what they consumed.

   Employees notified police after they saw the teenage boys consume
   $27.34 in merchandise, including Pringles potato chips, beef jerky and
   Chips Ahoy cookies.

   Employees trailed the boys out of the store, confronted them and
   notified police. The incident happened about 9:45 p.m. Jan. 17.

   Police issued larceny citations to two boys, both 17, and released a
   15-year-old boy to his father to await being notified by juvenile
   authorities.

   Tax fraud

   Tax-season fraud arrives just as surely as tax season itself.

   A 39-year-old woman who lives in The Crossings, an apartment complex on
   Canton’s north side, contacted police after she tried to file her tax
   returns and learned that someone already had done so using her name.

   She notified police Jan. 20 to report she had learned about the fraud
   when she went to H&R Block to file her taxes. She told police she
   wanted to document the incident in a move to address the problem.

   Warrant arrest

   A 64-year-old suspect, wanted in Canton on a retail fraud warrant, was
   arrested in Detroit and turned over to Canton police.

   The suspect was taken into custody in Detroit and turned over Friday to
   Canton authorities.
