   Police say they're searching for two pranksters who allegedly broke
   into a conductor's booth aboard an R train in Manhattan and announced
   over the public address system the train had been hijacked by ISIS,
   according to MTA sources.

   The incident happened on the Brooklyn-bound train between the 23rd
   Street and Union Square stations late Thursday night.

   "This is ISIS and we're hijacking the train," the suspects said over
   the loudspeaker, then fled laughing at the next stop, the sources
   said.

   Police said they're searching for the suspects, believed to be in their
   20s.

   A passenger told [65]The New York Post that the riders first heard some
   low singing over the broadcast system.

   "Then we heard, 'All hail ISIS! Jihad, Jihad, Jihad!" Lauren Crozier of
   Sunset Park told the paper.

   "Everyone took their earbuds out and stared at each other," she said.
   "I'm not sure any of us thought it was a credible threat. Not after the
   first moment, anyway."

   When the train pulled into Union Square, the "whole train emptied out,"
   Crozier told the Post.

   The train was taken out of service and brought to the Jamaica Yards in
   Queens, where an investigation was conducted, the Post reported, citing
   sources who called it a "hoax."
