McDonald’s Will Serve Happy Meals With Books Instead of Toys

Now through Feb. 15

   Trying to get your kids to read more? You might want to take them to
   McDonald’s, where they’ll get a book instead of a toy in their Happy
   Meals, now through Feb. 15. Fair warning: you might want to tell them
   in advance, because they just might throw a fit when they find a
   paperback instead of a shiny plastic toy.

   According to[89] the Los Angeles Times, McDonald’s is including four
   different books in this experiment. Three of them are Valentine’s Day
   themed: Clark the Shark Takes Heart by Bruce Hale and illustrated by
   Guy Francis, Happy Valentine’s Day, Mouse! by Laura Numeroff and
   Felicia Bond, and Pete the Cat: Valentine’s Day Is Cool by Kimberly and
   James Dean. The fourth book is the classic [90]Paddington by Michael
   Bond and illustrated by R. W. Alley.

   This is the third time the fast food chain has served miniature
   paperbacks instead of plastic toys in its Happy Meals. By the time this
   year’s giveaway is over, McDonald’s will have distributed 50 million
   children’s books.
