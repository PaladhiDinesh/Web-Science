Surprise! It's McDonald's: LA chef fools food bloggers with quarter pounders

   Chef Neal Fraser served avocado soup and spicy meatballs at an event
   for ‘food influencers’ in LA – then revealed that all the ingredients
   came from McDonald’s

   A well-known [47]Los Angeles chef tricked a group of foodies with an
   elegant meal prepared entirely out of McDonald’s food.

   Chef Neal Fraser, who hosted the meal last week at the Carondelet House
   in downtown Los Angeles, told about 40 “food influencers” in attendance
   he would be “cooking with experimental” and “fresh ingredients”, the
   [48]Orange County Register reported.

   spent in hell

   The twist: every dish served throughout the course of the evening came
   from the same ingredients used for McDonald’s menu staples like egg
   McMuffins and quarter pounders. The tasting menu included an avocado
   soup made with McDonald’s guacamole, a salad topped with bacon bits and
   buttermilk dressing (the crowd favorite), spicy meatballs,
   bacon-wrapped chicken and a coffee custard dessert.

   By the third course of spicy meatballs, diners became a little
   suspicious, questioning what new thing Fraser, chef and owner of the
   popular restaurant Redbird and former Top Chef Masters contestant, had
   included in the food.

   “It seemed a little off from what he normally serves,” said Danielle
   Salmon, “Chief Eating Officer” for a restaurant discovery blog called
   [50]Follow My Gut. “We were thinking it was a weird secret ingredient.”

   Not everybody was fooled. At the end of the meal, Fraser asked the
   guests to guess what the meal was made from and some shouted: “Golden
   arches.”

   Fraser said he collaborated with McDonald’s because the ingredients he
   uses at Redbird are not all that different from McDonald’s ingredients.
   McDonald’s put on the publicity stunt to change public perception of
   the fast-food chain.

   Before the reveal, Fraser worried his guests, which included food
   bloggers, food photographers and chefs, would be upset.

   “I just hope no one hits me,” he said.

   No one was angry, although some seemed somewhat shocked. Dinner guests,
   who were encouraged to share pictures of the meal online with the
   hashtag [51]#atasteofsocal, indicated that they had been fooled on
   [52]Instagram. Cameras and microphones hidden throughout the dining
   room captured guests eating, and a video of the event will be posted
   online later this month.

   On Follow My Gut’s Instagram account, Salmon posted a picture of the
   spicy meatballs and wrote: “At the ‘Not [53]@nealfraser Dinner cuz it’s
   Really McDonalds’ dinner and this came my way. Not sure if these were
   meatballs or just rounded quarter pounders with cheese but without buns
   and veggies, and the cheese.”

   Los Angeles-based cooking instructor and chef Eric Crowley said he
   enjoyed the meal, although the food lacked a lot of bold flavors. When
   he learned the ingredients came from McDonald’s, “it all made sense”,
   he said.

   Lifestyle blogger Roshonda Payne, who runs the blog [54]The Savvy
   Sistah, said she had no idea she was eating food from McDonald’s.

   “It just goes to show you that McDonald’s is [real] food,” she said.
