Donald Trump: ‘The Workers Of This Country Are With Me,’ Union Workers ‘Want
To Vote For Trump’

GOP frontrunner Donald Trump touted his support from unions and the workers
across America during a campaign stop in Salem, New Hampshire on Monday
morning where he took questions from voters.

   “The workers of this country are with me because I’m going to create
   jobs,” Trump said to a union worker who asked how Trump could pitch his
   campaign message to obtain union votes.

   “I’ve done very well with unions,” Trump responded, referencing
   building projects in Manhattan where he has worked with the unions in
   the past.

   “My support is really with those workers – those people,” Trump said,
   referencing policemen, plumbers and construction workers. “My weakest
   support [is] with rich people, isn’t that funny?”

   Trump joked that he doesn’t even like rich people.

   “The unions are almost all Democrat,” Trump said, adding that is their
   problem.

   “The men and people of the Teamsters want to vote for me,” he said,
   adding, the leadership is always stuck with the Democrats, “but the
   workers want to vote for Trump.”
