   Move over groundhogs, a Toronto raccoon just stole your day.

   TTC riders spotted a raccoon trying to hop on the southbound subway at
   Spadina station this morning.

     [82]@skunTTT Looks like it was looking for a free ride. Hopefully it
     was removed safely. ^CW

   No word yet on what a commuting raccoon means in terms of the changing
   season — but something must have scared off the masked bandit (maybe
   his shadow) because the raccoon decided to leave the train after
   causing a brief delay.

Second 'downtown freeloader' in two months

   This raccoon isn't the first to hitch a ride on the rails, back in
   December [89]a "downtown freeloader" raccoon was found on board a
   Lakeshore West GO train headed from Union station to Aldershot in
   Burlington.

   In that case, the raccoon did stick around for the ride.

   If you spot an animal on a GO train, Metrolinx recommends notifying an
   employee and avoid doing an emergency pull. (Tyler Kay)

   Metrolinx spokeswoman Anne Marie Aikins joked that "he had an hour long
   nap, probably snoozed."

   "Nobody checked to see if he tapped his Presto card."
