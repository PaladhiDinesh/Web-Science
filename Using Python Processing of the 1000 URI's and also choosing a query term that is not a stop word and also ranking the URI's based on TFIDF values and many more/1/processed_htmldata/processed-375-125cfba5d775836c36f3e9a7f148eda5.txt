From Lanterns to Lions, Ringing in Chinese New Year

   By [60]Suejane Chang

   Vice President, Walmart China

   February 05, 2016
   [?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.corporate.walmart.com%2F02%2Ff4%2F4a4ce4f242d79a
   556a84ff91f7bf%2Fchinese-new-year-celebration-lanterns.jpg]

   Feb. 8 marks the start of Chinese New Year, China’s most important
   celebration for families. Also known as the Spring Festival, Chinese
   New Year is a weeklong public holiday during which families celebrate a
   year of hard work and wish for good luck in the coming year.

   Those shopping in our stores in China see lots of Chinese New Year
   decorations and traditional foods stocked for this busy time. For
   readers who aren’t in China, here’s some background on the
   celebrations.

   Traditional Family Meals

   Before the first day of the first month in the lunar calendar, people
   all over China travel to their hometowns to unite with their families
   and decorate their homes in red — a color that symbolizes good luck and
   joy — and prepare for Chinese New Year celebrations. The night before
   the Chinese New Year, we prepare a [61]feast made up of symbolic foods:
     * In Chinese culture, a fish course represents wealth in the future,
       while peanuts signify longevity and good health.
     * Some food symbolism in Chinese New Year dishes is more visual, such
       as hot pot, which involves simmering meat and vegetables in a round
       pot at the center of the table. The shape of the pot represents
       perfection and satisfaction.
     * [62]Dumplings are an example of a food with a more historical tie
       because they resemble the gold currency — Yuanbao — used in ancient
       China. Today, dumplings are still thought to signify wealth in the
       coming year and are a delicious treat stuffed with different
       fillings.

   Celebrations

   Like with New Year’s Eve in the U.S. and other western countries,
   Chinese New Year involves staying up late. We light firecrackers at
   midnight, a tradition that dates back to ancient folklore. Though the
   New Year is a cause for celebration now, legend has it that Chinese
   villagers used to stoke their fires with bamboo to keep away a
   terrifying, sharp-toothed monster that arose from the sea at the end of
   the lunar year to prey on people and livestock. Now, we use
   firecrackers to celebrate the new year and also scare off any bad luck
   that might be on the horizon.

   Celebrations culminate in the [63]Lantern Festival, where people gather
   to admire the illuminated lanterns (some floating, some carried by
   children, some fixed as decorations) and guess riddles written on them.
   On New Year’s Day, people also watch lion dances, in which participants
   don elaborate, mythical lion costumes that seem larger than life — and
   eat rice dumplings.

   One of our family traditions is for children and grandchildren to wish
   elders in the family good wishes for the new year and, in turn, the
   elders will give children a red envelope of money for good luck and to
   buy toys and books.  Children often sleep with the red envelope under
   the pillow to bring good luck throughout the year.

   The Year of the Monkey

   This year is the [64]year of the monkey, the ninth of 12 animals in the
   recurring 12-year Chinese zodiac cycle. People born in the year of the
   monkey are believed to be energetic, witty and mischievous. I look
   forward to greeting the year of the monkey surrounded by my family and
   enjoying the snacks and festivities that come with the celebrations. No
   matter your Chinese zodiac, may the New Year bring good fortune to you
   and your family!

   It’s King Cake Time, But Walmart’s Queens Reign All Year Long

   [68]Innovation

This Store is Helping Reimagine the Supercenter

   By [69]Walmart Staff

   February 12, 2016
   [?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.corporate.walmart.com%2F66%2Fdb%2F7be1c7b546028d
   6a6e9ff678117f%2Fscan-and-go-checkout-registers-in-walmart-supercenter-
   5260.jpg]

   Last year, supercenter #5260 in Rogers, Arkansas, got a facelift. Added
   into the refreshed look were several new approaches to technologies,
   services, products and layouts, which are currently being tested with
   customers. Early reports are positive, but it’s too soon to tell what’s
   working and what isn’t. What’s clear: Things that seem straightforward
   could show up in new stores or remodels. Store 5260 is simply the first
   step toward the supercenter of the future, but it’s critical to
   informing upcoming tests.
   Electronics department in Walmart Supercenter 5260

   Room to Play: The electronics and entertainment areas have a sleek,
   modern look that customers say feels very welcoming and on-trend. “One
   of the things that we noticed early on as people walk by electronics is
   that they stop and look, and then they get drawn in," said Sherry
   Curtis-Swenson, the store’s manager.
   Walmart Produce Department in Walmart Supercenter 5260

   A New Angle on Fresh: A reorganization (along with improved sight lines
   and angled aisles) puts berries — a growing category — in the front of
   the department. Bananas, already a huge draw, are toward the back to
   help lead customers through. Purple signage in Fresh and throughout the
   store connects to an increase in organic products.
   Digital menu boards and service signage in a Walmart automotive area

   Car Care, Customer Care: Along with new digital menu boards and signage
   in automotive, there’s a comfortable customer waiting area — furnished
   with items from [70]Walmart.com. Customers can watch TV, enjoy a
   coffee, charge their phones, and see their cars being serviced.
   In-store pickup and Walmart services share a space at the front of a
   Walmart supercenter

   Pickup, Up Front: [71]In-Store Pickup and Walmart Services share space
   up front at Store 5260. It’s clearly marked so customers can find it
   and get their orders quickly.
   A wide checkout area features double belts to place your items on for
   faster checkout

   Check Out Your Way: There are multiple options for checkout. Scan & Go
   supplies a wand so customers can scan items as they’re shopping. Hybrid
   registers can be self-service or manned by associates, depending on the
   need. And high-velocity checkouts — where a cashier scans items while
   the customer moves through the line to pay — are more than three times
   faster than conventional checkouts.
   Baby strollers line the baby department floor in a Walmart Supercenter

   One-Stop Baby Shop: The new baby department combines it all in one
   space. There’s even a stroller garage for hands-on tryouts. “Customers
   love being able to move the strollers around,” Sherry said.
   Big Rub BBQ restaurant inside Walmart Supercenter 5260

   Local Eats: A local food truck operator, [72]Big Rub BBQ, has
   restaurant space in the store, with lots of glass and natural light —
   and even seating on an outdoor patio!

   There’s nothing like the chills you get from hearing a well-told scary
   story.

   Just in time for a late-night Halloween listen, filmmaker [80]Paul
   Soter (the creator behind comedies Super Troopers and Beerfest, as well
   as horror films Club Dread and Dark Circles) hearkens back to the
   spooky fun of classic radio theater.

   In Feed the Moon, what starts out as a simple trip to Walmart on
   Halloween night becomes one man’s nightmarish journey into the
   impossible.

Hello, Nicaragua! Welcoming Walmart to Managua

   By [86]Carlos Arroyo

   SVP and COO, Walmart Central America

   February 10, 2016
   [?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.corporate.walmart.com%2F1c%2Fc0%2F9d8766f4424097
   a618d159f0ad41%2Fnicaragua-walmart-store.jpg]

   My team ended 2015 in a big way. After months of hard work, we opened
   the first Walmart store in Nicaragua, offering our everyday low prices
   on a wide assortment of 40,000 products – a very significant value
   proposition for the Nicaraguan market. We know this to be true because
   people are welcoming us with open arms.
   Hundreds of Customers waiting to enter Nicaragua Walmart during its
   grand opening

   The day we opened, literally hundreds of enthusiastic people attended
   the grand opening of our supercenter in Managua, ready to save money on
   everything from clothes, electronics and paint to toys, appliances and
   groceries. Watching the excitement and knowing that this store is
   making a difference for these people reminded me once again of our
   mission to help people live better by simply paying less for the things
   they need.

   This is a $17 million investment in a modern, comfortable store of
   5,890 square meters (over 63,000 square feet) that created 150 direct
   jobs (the associates that will work in the supercenter) and 1,575
   estimated indirect jobs (jobs as a result of the supercenter such as
   cleaning crews and suppliers). And, because we strongly encourage the
   growth of local businesses, a great majority of our assortment comes
   from small and medium-sized Nicaraguan suppliers.

   Walmart operates 87 stores in Nicaragua under other formats like Palí
   (discount), Maxi Palí (warehouse) and La Union (supermarket), but this
   is the first Walmart-branded location. We are now offering the
   distinctive standard of service, price and assortment through our
   iconic Walmart supercenter. And the excitement we’ve seen is definitely
   our major reward.

The Dish on Gumbaya: A Foodie Follows a Dream

   By [91]Edward Mueller

   Chief Operating Officer – Carolina Gumbaya

   February 09, 2016
   [?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.corporate.walmart.com%2Ff7%2F26%2F17524c0442b8a7
   b9c7f9700c2e7d%2Fcarolina-gumbaya.jpg]

   When I moved from Michigan to Myrtle Beach, S.C., five years ago, it
   marked a new beginning for me. I was stepping away from 20 years in the
   insurance business, into a warmer climate and yearning to return to my
   culinary roots.

   When I was growing up, my family owned a food processing plant. I was
   running a restaurant up north by the time I was 19. I’ve always been
   curious about flavors and what’s out there. Whenever I travel, I’m that
   guy who only eats local cuisine. And when I began digging into my new
   surroundings, I discovered the history of gumbo in the U.S. – which
   people naturally associate with Louisiana – can actually be traced back
   to South Carolina in the 1600s.
   Carolina Gumbaya is topped with white rice and is in a white bowl

   The first recipe I developed when I set foot in Myrtle Beach was my own
   gumbo. There were so many beautiful ingredients down here – fresh
   shrimp, whitefish, Andouille sausage, okra – and when I dipped my spoon
   into that first bowl, I had a moment. I thought, “This is it. I’ve
   really got something here.”

   I knew this was a recipe that would make South Carolina proud. My gumbo
   immediately started winning people over at local farmers markets and
   festivals. I looked into opportunities to get my product on the market,
   from selling to local restaurants to partnering with a delivery service
   in the area. But the day the district manager at our local Walmart gave
   me 15 minutes of his time – that was the day everything changed.

   That was Dec. 17, 2013. When I walked out 45 minutes later, it was with
   the understanding we had a deal. By May 2015, my [92]Carolina Gumbaya
   was being sold in the frozen section of 17 Walmart stores in South
   Carolina. Today, that’s grown to 137 Walmart stores in five states,
   including Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and
   Florida.

   It really has been an amazing experience, to see so many people embrace
   this recipe I created in the kitchen of my own home. But when people
   ask me if it has taken me by surprise, I have to tell them, “Honestly,
   no.”
   Carolina Gumbaya product packaging

   Frozen food has come a long way in recent years. [93]Carolina Gumbaya –
   a name drawn from the words gumbo and jambalaya – isn’t packed with
   fillers and preservatives. The label doesn’t have words you can’t
   pronounce. There are 12 whole, wild-caught shrimp in every one-quart
   container. And the blonde roux I developed, along with my secret
   spices, are a few of the differentiating factors.

   Turn on any food channel or open a food publication and you’re going to
   hear about the flavor of the South. It’s the South’s time to shine on
   the culinary stage – so products like mine have an opportunity to
   spread across the country. Along the way, Walmart’s commitment to
   domestic manufacturing is opening the door for small entrepreneurs like
   my business partner, Laura Spencer, and me. Products like Carolina
   Gumbaya are helping create jobs at growing U.S.-based companies like
   Duke Food Productions, the company who helps produce our product. These
   kinds of stories are a win-win for everyone. And we’re just getting
   started.
