EQ: CRITICAL TO YOUR SUCCESS – PART 3

   [25]0
   By [26]Sean McDonald on December 8, 2015 [27]Wellbeing

   After reading the first two articles, you are now aware of your
   emotions and you know how you react in certain situations enabling you
   to manage your emotions more effectively. The third component to EQ is
   Social Awareness. We all know someone who consistently offends people
   without knowing it. It would be safe to say that person has a low
   social awareness. These are the people no-one wants around in a
   business environment, at parties or in any situation where
   relationships are critical.

   How socially aware are you? Next time you are with someone, pay
   attention to the verbal and non-verbal cues they are giving you such as
   the sound of their voice, the color of their skin, the pace of their
   breathing, the tension (or not) in their face or other parts of their
   body. Try to pick up on relationships within groups or the vibe in a
   room filled with people. Having laser like social awareness enables you
   to adjust your communication according to the environment, giving you
   the highest chance of having your voice heard and accepted.

   More next issue.
