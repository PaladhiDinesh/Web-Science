   A shocking video of a group of migrant men attacking two pensioners who
   allegedly stopped them from groping a young woman on the subway in
   Munich has sparked a police hunt.

   The footage shows the gang of around five men - who appear to be of
   'Arab' origin - roughly seizing one elderly man by the arms as they
   shout abuse at him.

   The second elderly victim can be seen grappling with one of the gang,
   before he is held up by the neck and threatened.

   Detectives in [71]Germany have today launched a hunt for the gang, and
   are appealing for witnesses to come forward in the criminal
   investigation.

   Munich man Tom Roth uploaded the footage - captured while travelling
   from Sendlinger Tor station to the Metro's city centre terminal - to
   his Facebook page.

   He said the fight broke out after a female passenger rejected the
   advances of one of the gang, after he placed his hand on her back.

   In response, the man smashed his hand against one of the carriage's
   glass windows - which caused outrage among the shocked passengers.

   When one of the elderly men asked the group to stop being so aggressive
   and leave the woman alone, one patted him mockingly on the head.

   That act of disrespect sparked a furious exchange.

   Translated, the post accompanying Mr Roth's video upload reads: 'A
   young woman was attacked on the subway. When two old men tried to
   intervene, they too were attacked.

   'This was in the heart of Munich, in the middle of the day. I got on
   the train at Sendlinger Tor travelling to the main railway station. I
   sat in a four-seater, across from a young lady.

   'In the four-way behind her sat two asylum seekers. One of them, a
   young man, probably of Arab origin, bothered the woman.
   Recorded on a mobile phone, the disgraceful video shows the men - of
   Eastern European or Arabic origin - holding one man by the arms as they
   verbally abuse him. The second victim is seen grappling with one of the
   migrants, before he is held up by the neck and threatened (pictured)

   Munich man Tom Roth uploaded the disgraceful video to his Facebook
   page. He caught the footage while travelling from Sendlinger Tor
   station to the Metro's city centre terminal. He said the fight broke
   out after one of the asylum seekers was rejected by a woman who he had
   placed his hand upon on the train

   'He said something to her and asked: "Why will you not answer me in
   German?"

   'She responded: "Because you asked me in English". I think he had his
   hand on her back. She turned away and looked in my direction.

   'As the train continued, the asylum seeker struck the glass window full
   force. I guess he was angry the woman rejected him. Several gentlemen
   shouted at him to stop.

   'One of these men, in the four seats beside me, was then touched on the
   head by one of the asylum seekers wearing a brown jacket. He stroked
   his bald head, to mock him. It was such disrespectful behaviour, the
   likes of which I have rarely seen before.

   'The gentleman stood up right away. The asylum seeker then turned,
   approached the man and grabbed him by the neck. Everyone immediately
   became involved, with many trying to get in between the pair.
   Mr Roth claimed one asylum seeker smashed his hand against the
   carriage's glass window - an aggressive act of defiance the train's
   other passengers requested he desist
   When they did, one elderly German man was patted mockingly on the head
   by one of the migrant group. That act of disrespect sparked an angry
   exchange

   Mr Roth claimed one asylum seeker smashed his hand against the
   carriage's glass window - an aggressive act of defiance the train's
   other passengers requested he desist. When they did, one elderly German
   man was patted mockingly on the head by one of the migrant group. That
   act of disrespect sparked an angry exchange

   'The man's attacker fell back in his four-seater. There were four
   asylum seekers now involved, staring at us and two other older
   gentlemen angrily.

   'There were about 10-15 people beside and behind me. The situation was
   brought under control. When the train reached the station I shouted
   that I would call the police.

   'Some of the other passengers yelled that they should leave the train,
   which they then did. I didn't call the police after all, since I have
   been told several times by friends that the police tell victims there's
   nothing they can do about it.'

   Police have today launched an investigation into the video, after
   finding it on 'a social network', which is reportedly focused on the
   man in the brown/orange jacket.

   'We know about the video, after we found out about it on a social
   network,' a spokesman for Munich police department told MailOnline.

   ‚ÄòBased on the video and the witness account we have decided to open a
   criminal investigation. We are in contact with a witness, but still
   need to identify the other people in the video.

   ‚ÄòFor starters, we need to find out whether any actual bodily harm
   and/or sexual harassment can be established.

   ‚ÄòIt would appear from the video that the aggressors have Arab
   backgrounds, but whether they are asylum seekers or not we can‚Äôt say at
   the moment.

   ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs mere speculation. We are working to identify them.‚Äô
   The incident is the latest violent coming together of asylum seekers
   and Germans to have come to light in recent weeks. Migrants are seen
   arriving by train at Munich Hauptbahnhof railway station on September
   12 last year

   Arab and North African origin'

   He added: ‚ÄòPeople should always call the police in such situations. We
   act straight away and will be there in a matter of minutes if something
   occurs in the subway. The public transportation in Munich is generally
   very safe.

   ‚ÄòThings occur from time to time, but this is the first case of this
   sort I am aware of.‚Äô

   The incident is the latest violent coming together of asylum seekers
   and Germans to have come to light in recent weeks.

   It follows New Year riots in Cologne triggered by a number of sexual
   assaults made against local women by a group of up to a 1,000 men 'of
   Arab and North African origin'.

   Police described the series of assaults against women outside the
   city's main train terminal as 'a completely new dimension of crime'.

   Mr Roth stressed that after his own experience, he believes German
   chancellor Angela Merkel must now take action to protect the country's
   citizens.

   He said: 'I just felt the need to share this. Those involved were very
   distressed. An older lady said she doesn't leave her home at night any
   more. The two gentlemen said that it cannot go on like this.

   'I felt safer in Germany two or three years ago. I find that terrifying
   and sad.

   'I'm really sorry for the people who need help, but something must
   happen against the violent and disrespectful people among them. Many
   Asylum seekers have no respect for women, no respect for men - not even
   the old - let alone our laws and the police.'
