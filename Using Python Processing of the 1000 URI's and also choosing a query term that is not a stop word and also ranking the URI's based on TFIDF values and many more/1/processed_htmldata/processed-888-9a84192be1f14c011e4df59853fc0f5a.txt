This is what an untouched McDonald’s Happy Meal looks like after six years

   IF there was ever an image to get parents thinking twice before feeding
   their kids fast food, this is it.

   A woman who claims she left a McDonald’s Happy Meal untouched for six
   years as an experiment has shared the nasty outcome on social media,
   accompanied with a receipt dating back to January 8, 2010.

   Jennifer Lovdahl, a chiropractor from Alaska in the US, posted the
   photos to [54]Facebook, saying she initially conducted the experiment
   to prove to her patients how many chemicals are in fast food items.

   “It’s been 6 years since I bought this ‘Happy Meal’ at McDonald’s,” she
   wrote.

   “It’s been sitting at our office this whole time and has not rotted,
   molded, or decomposed at all!!! It smells only of cardboard.”

   The nuggets and fries, which Ms Lovedahl says were left out of the
   fridge the whole time, appear to be in pristine condition.

   One Facebook user observed, “The receipt has disintegrated more than
   the food.”

     It's been 6 years since I bought this "Happy Meal" at McDonald's.
     It's been sitting at our office this whole time and...
     Posted by [55]Jennifer Lovdahl on [56]Wednesday, February 3, 2016

   “We did this experiment to show our patients how unhealthy this “food”
   is. Especially for our growing children!! There are so many chemicals
   in this food! Choose real food! Apples, bananas, carrots, celery ...
   those are real fast food,” Ms Lovdahl wrote.

   Anyone in a rush to get to the Golden Arches after seeing these photos?
   Mmm, tastes like cardboard. Picture: Jennifer Lovdahl/Facebook
