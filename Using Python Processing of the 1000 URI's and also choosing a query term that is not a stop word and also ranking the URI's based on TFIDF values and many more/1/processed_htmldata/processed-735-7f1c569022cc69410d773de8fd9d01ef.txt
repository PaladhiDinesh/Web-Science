Monday Polls: Cruz 1st in Arkansas, Trump Well Ahead in Michigan

As the New Hampshire Republican Primary is just hours away, new polls for
crucial early primary states have been published, indicating a close race
ahead between the highest polling Republican candidates: Donald Trump, Sen.
Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL).

   Ted Cruz is in the lead in Arkansas, which will hold its primary vote
   on March 1.

   A new Talk Business/Hendrix College poll has Cruz in first with 27
   percent of the vote, followed by Donald Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio, who
   are tied in second with 23 percent. They are followed by Dr. Ben Carson
   at 11 percent, then John Kasich and Carly Fiorina at 4. Lastly, Jeb
   Bush and Gov. Chris Christie receive only 1 percent of the likely vote
   apiece, according to the survey results, which adds that 6 percent
   remain undecided.

   On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton is the overwhelming favorite,
   with 57 percent of likely voters favoring the former first lady. Sen.
   Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is 22 points behind, garnering 25 percent.
   Eighteen percent remain undecided, the Talk Business/Hendrix College
   poll indicates.

   Donald Trump holds a commanding lead in the latest Michigan Republican
   Primary poll, sponsored by IMP/Target Insyght, which says the business
   mogul is 14 points ahead of his closest competitor.

   Michigan voters will head to the polls on March 8, one week after Super
   Tuesday.

   The poll shows Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio tied for second with 21 percent
   apiece. They are followed by Gov. John Kasich (R-OH) with 6 percent of
   the vote, then Dr. Ben Carson, who accumulated 5 percent of likely
   voters. There is a three-way tie for last place between Jeb Bush, Gov.
   Chris Christie (R-NJ), and Carly Fiorina, who grabbed 3 percent each.

   “Rumors of Trump’s demise have been greatly exaggerated,” Susan J.
   Demas, the Editor of Inside Michigan Politics, said in a [27]statement.
   “As much as people hoped he would fade away after his disappointing
   second-place finish in Iowa, Trump still holds a double-digit lead in
   Michigan over his nearest rivals, Cruz and Rubio.”

   Hillary Clinton remains well ahead in the Michigan Democratic Primary
   poll, having garnered a 32 point lead ahead of Sen. Bernie Sanders
   (57%-25%) in the IMP/Target Insyght automated survey.
