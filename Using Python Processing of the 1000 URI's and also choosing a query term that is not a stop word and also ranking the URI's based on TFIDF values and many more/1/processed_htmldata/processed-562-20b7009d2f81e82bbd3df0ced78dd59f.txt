Trump Was Right AGAIN… Check Out What Bill Clinton Said In Audio Tapes

   [27]GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump has recently decided to
   blast former president Bill Clinton for his mistreatment of women after
   Hillary Clinton tried to label Trump a sexist. The Clintons have been
   relatively silent over Trump’s attacks, but damning new audio shows The
   Donald wasn’t far off with what he said.
   [INS: :INS]

   Back in the 1990s, Bill Clinton’s friend and biographer, Taylor Branch,
   took notes about a conversation the two had, then immediately recorded
   them into an audio diary, reports the [28]Washington Free Beacon. In
   the conversation, Clinton dismissed Paula Jones, who accused him of
   sexual assault, as a “floozy” and a “nobody” that was simply trying to
   milk him for money and attention.

   “[Clinton] said they had now changed Paula Jones’s hair style, made her
   look less like a floozy, and that she didn’t seem to have any visible
   income but was always driving a new car,” Branch, who’s also a
   historian, said in the audio tapes obtained by the Free Beacon.

   “[Clinton] said … these political lawyers are going to tell her that
   there’s not much likelihood that she would get any money out of this,”
   the audio continued. “That it’s just about [Jones] ‘being somebody’
   because, if she settles the case, she goes back to being ‘nobody,’ and
   the trial is going to be her moment in the sun.”

   A lot of people don’t remember, but Jones was also
   coincidentally audited by the IRS around the same time that she brought
   the allegations against Clinton, which seems familiar, considering the
   Obama administration targeted political adversaries using the same
   agency. However, Clinton denied ordering the IRS to audit Jones,
   although he did say that she probably deserved it.

   “[Clinton] said ‘I didn’t have anything to do with it, and I know
   nobody around here had to do with her getting audited by the IRS.’ But,
   he said, ‘independently, it stands to some reason,’” recounted Branch.
   “She doesn’t have any visible means of support and is always traveling
   around and driving a new car, no job, so forth.”

   Clinton’s close allies tried to paint Jones as “trailer trash,” looking
   to get rich off the president after she accused him of exposing himself
   and asking her to kiss his genitalia. In 1998, the lawsuit she brought
   against him was dismissed, but when Jones appealed the decision,
   Clinton ended up paying her $850,000 to drop the suit.

   During their talk, Branch said that while Clinton may have shown
   remorse for his affair with Monica Lewinski, he certainly didn’t show
   any in private. In fact, according to Branch, any contrition needed to
   be “coached” out of Clinton.

   “What contrition there was had to be coached out of him, because I sure
   didn’t feel it tonight,” Branch said in the tape. “I mean, there wasn’t
   even a glimmer of ‘I’m sorry, I let you down’—meaning me, not that I
   asked for it or anything. ‘I see the hurt in people’s eyes who believed
   in me.’ I didn’t sense any of that on a personal level.”

   The conversation also revealed what many of us already knew – that
   Hillary Clinton is an ice princess only concerned with political
   aspirations. When Branch asked how the various allegations were
   affecting their marriage, Bill Clinton said Hillary was more concerned
   about him losing his job than she was about their relationship.

   “[Clinton’s] answer was not about the relationship. His answer was
   ‘Hillary was more upset about the impeachment than I was,’” Branch
   said. [29]More
