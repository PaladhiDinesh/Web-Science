   Eight years ago, Saoirse Ronan made her first impression on U.S.
   audiences in Atonement as Briony, the confused, vengeful girl whose lie
   sets the plot in motion. That watchful, unsettling performance won her
   an Oscar nomination at age 13. Since then, she has made a couple of
   film appearances per year at most (a child assassin holding her own
   against Cate Blanchett in Hanna; a clever baker in [47]The Grand
   Budapest Hotel), staying more or less above the Hollywood fray (thanks
   in large part to the grounding influence of her parents — her father,
   Paul, is a working actor). That may prove tougher now: At 21, she’s
   again an [48]Oscar nominee, this time as a leading actress, for her
   performance as Irish immigrant Eilis in Brooklyn. Ronan’s own
   immigration experience was the opposite of Eilis’s: She was born in the
   Bronx and lived there until she was 3, then moved back to Ireland. But
   now she’s returned to the city that has such a hold on her imagination
   to make her Broadway debut in The Crucible as Abigail Williams — a
   confused, vengeful girl not unlike her first big role. We talked to her
   about going onstage for the first time and discussing child stardom
   with Jodie Foster. Her name, by the way, is [49]pronounced Sir-sha.

Brooklyn Author Colm Tóibín on Saoirse Ronan’s New York

   “We moved back to Ireland when I was 3, so only certain things stick
   out in my head, but the memories I have seem kind of vivid. It’s just
   little things, like I remember one time my mom took me to the
   supermarket and she bought marshmallows and beer [laughs]. And the
   supermarket was a good walk away from the apartment, and we were in the
   Bronx, so there were hills, and I remember she put the crate of beer on
   the pram that she used and then she was like, ‘Here, you sit on top.’
   So I sat on top of the crate of beer! She’s a great mother, I promise.
   And I remember one Christmas, when, to this day, I’m convinced, I was
   looking out the window and I saw Santa Claus in the sky with all his
   reindeer. Mom and Dad have video footage of it, and my dad was at the
   other window out of my sight ringing these bells. Whatever kind of time
   I had here, it has given me a very strong connection to the city. When
   I came back, it instantly felt right. There are things about the city
   that are new that you have to get used to, but it doesn’t get me down,
   it really just excites me. I feel like with New York, more than
   anywhere else, any struggle you have, any hurdle you have to overcome,
   everyone else has faced exactly the same thing. It makes you feel like
   you’re never really alone, you know? New York is made up of every other
   country; there’s hardly any native New Yorkers here, really. Half of
   the cast in our play are Irish and English. I actually feel closer to
   Ireland here than I did when I lived anywhere else.

   When you go to L.A., everyone has an idea in their head of what L.A. is
   or what Hollywood is, and it’s just not like that at all — it’s just a
   big desert where everything’s spread out. I feel like you come to New
   York and it just exceeds your expectations. Every now and again, you
   just go, ‘I’m in New York. This is fuckin’ great.’ I did that the other
   day — I was on the subway and I thought, The last time I was properly
   on a subway train I was 3!

   I do feel like if they took a cloth to scrub them a little bit it
   wouldn’t hurt [laughs]. Even the subway train we had in Brooklyn — I
   had no idea that’s how it would have been 50 years ago, but Jesus, can
   you imagine in the summer how hot it would’ve been?

   I’ve only hung out in Brooklyn a little bit, to be honest. We only did
   two days shooting for Brooklyn on Clinton Street, and I’ve gone back
   there since — I have friends who live in Boerum Hill and Cobble Hill. I
   imagine if I were to stay here after the play, which I most likely
   will, that’s where I’d go. It’s got such a lovely feel, doesn’t it?
   Such a nice neighborhood feel.

   I literally have never, ever, done a professional play before. I had
   done school plays when I was 5 to 12 — a tree, an evil queen; I think I
   played a bumblebee. But apart from that [no] theater at all. I was
   always cautious about taking on a play when I was younger. I knew from
   my dad’s own experience that you really need stamina. He never went to
   school for it. Mom and he just came over to work — a lot of that
   generation chose work over college because it was kind of the more
   realistic route at the time. And Mom became a nanny and my dad started
   working in a bar. And a lot of Irish actors would go in and they got to
   know him, and one of them eventually asked him to audition for a play.
   He just learned on the job. I think it was the best way for both of us
   — it shaped how we work. So I was aware that to take on something like
   that when you were just a kid, to me it would’ve been just a bit
   presumptuous. But I’ve always said that when I was about 21, that’s
   when I’d do a play.

   I only just started rehearsals. You feel everything. Your brain just
   doesn’t stop. It’s different from film — usually my preparation is
   learning my lines and then going on set and trying different things
   out, and hopefully you capture it and then it’s done, out of your
   hands. Whereas with a play, it’s constantly evolving. There’s no real
   respite. You’re thinking of every possible [meaning] one line could
   have.

   Abigail is almost like Briony if she was about 16. I think with
   Abigail, there’s this sense of abandonment that all the girls have.
   There were so many attacks on these little Puritan villages, and so
   many of their parents were killed — so that sense of authority they’d
   get from parents is gone. John Proctor kind of gives her that purpose
   and makes her feel like she’s stronger and bigger. A lot of the
   [orphaned] girls back then were swapped around from one household to
   the next; once they got to a certain age they were sent to live with a
   different family. So you’re surrounded by this fairly cold community,
   with rules for everything, and she’s a teenager becoming a sexual
   creature but she’s still a child in some ways — there’s just loads to
   think about, and I’m still bloody figuring it out, and I know I will be
   for quite a while.

   We rehearsed a scene today where gradually everyone quietly starts to
   turn on each other and looks as though they could kill someone, and you
   see how, like in religion, it can become so extreme when you follow it
   to the letter. Suddenly you’re not able to be human, almost, you know?
   Of course they ended up taking people to court if someone looked at
   them wrong, or blaming someone for the loss of their child, or whatever
   it is. I started reading this book by Stacy Schiff, and to know that at
   the time, some men got into Harvard based off, like, the amount of meat
   that was given by their fathers to the college! A whole round of beef
   would pay for a year’s tuition. It’s mental.

   It’s funny, I didn’t really feel [some of the pressures of Hollywood]
   when I was younger. I feel it a bit now, and I could see a change when
   Hanna came out, because it was the first sort of commercial success I’d
   had, apart from Atonement, and I was very young then — a lot of that
   went over my head. Part of it was that I’d grown up outside L.A., so I
   wasn’t exposed to the competitive side of that world, where you feel
   like you have to do a thousand and one things in order to keep up with
   everyone else. I didn’t have that pressure of feeling like I needed to
   be exposed more or do a big studio film in order to get more work. It
   was down to the type of work I wanted to do. At the end of the day,
   it’s sort of like your portfolio. A piece of work is something you put
   time and hard work into, and you want to be able to stand next to it
   and say you really believed in it.

   I was talking to someone who started out as a child actor, last night,
   and went on to do incredible things, and we were both saying it was a
   huge, huge influence to have our mothers with us when we were young and
   mothers who came from more of an ethical standpoint than a business
   one. To have someone with you from 10 to 19 when you’re on a set, who
   has perspective and is only there to look out for you, it really means
   that you have a more realistic way of looking at this entire world. [It
   was] Jodie Foster. She’s absolutely amazing.”
