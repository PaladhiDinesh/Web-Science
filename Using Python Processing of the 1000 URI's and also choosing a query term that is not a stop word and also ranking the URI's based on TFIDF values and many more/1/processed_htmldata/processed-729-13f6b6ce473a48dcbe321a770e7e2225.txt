Ted Cruz Is Not Eligible to Be President

At least according to the most plausible constitutional interpretation.

   on Feb. 7, 2016, in Keene, New Hampshire.

   With Ted Cruz the victor of the first contest of the GOP nominating
   calendar, we can no longer avoid the question mischievously posed by
   Donald Trump: Is Cruz ineligible to be president? Cruz was born in
   Canada to an American mother and a Cuban father. The Constitution says
   that only a “natural born citizen” can be president. Is Cruz a natural
   born citizen? (You may recall that before he attacked Cruz on this
   front, Trump spent months flogging a [11]ludicrous version of this
   critique against President Obama, who was actually born in the United
   States, unlike Cruz.)

   The words natural born citizen, and their original meaning at the time
   that this constitutional clause was crafted, go a long way to answering
   this question. In founding-era America, like today, a person could be a
   citizen by virtue of birth on American territory; a citizen by virtue
   of a statute that granted citizenship to him at birth; a “naturalized”
   citizen, meaning one who entered the country as an alien but later
   obtained citizenship via a process determined by law; and a foreigner.

   A natural born citizen cannot be a foreigner. Foreigners are not
   citizens. A natural born citizen cannot be a person who was
   naturalized. Those people are not born citizens; they’re born aliens.
   Most important for the purposes of the Cruz question, a natural born
   citizen cannot be someone whose birth entitled him to citizenship
   because of a statute—in this case a [12]statute that confers
   citizenship on a person born abroad to an American parent. In the 18^th
   century, as now, the word natural meant “[13]in the regular course of
   things.” Then, as now, almost all Americans obtained citizenship by
   birth in this country, not by birth to Americans abroad. The natural
   way to obtain citizenship, then, was (and is) by being born in this
   country. Because Cruz was not “natural born”—not born in the United
   States—he is ineligible for the presidency, under the most plausible
   interpretation of the Constitution.

   The historical background supports this view. In the founding era, it
   was possible—even common—for a head of state to be foreign born, and
   even to be a foreigner. The then-king of England—George III—descended
   from the German House of Hanover. His immediate predecessors—Georges I
   and II—were German born. William III—who came to power in the Glorious
   Revolution of 1688, which initiated the constitutional monarchy headed
   by the Georges—was himself Dutch. In the 1600s, the crown was passed
   among another group of foreigners—the House of Stuart. James I, who was
   jointly king of England and Scotland, was Scottish born, as was his
   son, Charles I.

   Legislators create laws, not words.

   The English tolerated foreign rulers because the rules of dynastic
   succession were widely accepted at the time. But the English resented
   and distrusted their foreign monarchs. After deposing James II—who as a
   Catholic, and a cousin and ally of Louis XIV of France, was suspected
   of foreign sympathies—Parliament banned Catholics from the throne.
   Moreover, Parliament declared that the nation would not be obligated to
   fight in defense of foreign dominions of a British king who is not “a
   native of this Kingdom of England.”

   The founders admired the British form of government and modeled the
   president after the king. The risk that a person with foreign
   connections and sympathies might seize the presidency would have been
   uppermost in their minds when crafting the language that determined who
   could hold office. Other provisions in the Constitution ensured that
   members of Congress had significant attachments to the United States,
   though they could be foreign born; in the case of the presidency, the
   founders used stronger language.

   Cruz’s defenders point out that many of the founders were lawyers who
   were familiar with British law, which prevailed in the colonies before
   the Revolution. While in the common law “natural born subjects” of the
   British crown meant people born on territory controlled by the British
   king, Parliament passed several statutes in the 17^th and 18^th
   centuries that gave the foreign born children of British subjects the
   status of “natural born subjects.” The founders, when they used the
   term “natural born Citizen,” may well have had this broader
   interpretation in mind, as argued by law professor Michael Ramsey in
   [14]a comprehensive and carefully reasoned academic paper.

   However, the statutes typically provided that a foreign born person
   would be considered a natural born subject for all “intents and
   purposes.” As legislatures often do, Parliament preferred using a
   comprehensive legal fiction (a person born abroad is treated as if he
   were natural born even though he is technically not) to using
   cumbersome new language piecemeal (explaining, every time new laws are
   passed, that they applied to foreign born subjects as well as natural
   born subjects). Parliament did not change the ordinary meaning of the
   words natural born; it just gave other people the status of those
   natural born.

   If you are a foreigner and try to become President through subterfuge
   (i.e. by falsely claiming to be a natural born citizen) isn't that the
   highest level of espionage?  More...

   Legislators create laws, not words: The ordinary meaning of natural
   born stayed the same even while legal fictions created by statutes
   proliferated. Similarly, the ordinary meaning of the word person is
   human being even though Congress has provided [16]that corporations are
   persons for certain purposes. When most citizens at the founding read
   natural born, they must have assumed someone actually born in the
   country, just as today when you see the word person in the newspaper,
   you don’t assume that that the reporter means a corporation as well. To
   naturalize an alien is to confer citizenship status but not to somehow
   convert him to having been born in America; similarly, to confer
   citizenship by statute to someone born abroad to an American parent is
   not the same thing as retroactively making that person born in this
   country—making him natural born—which would be impossible.

   Times have changed since the 18^th century. I doubt that a President
   Cruz would try to bring America under Canadian control. And I’m not
   worried that Americans will hand the presidency to Vladimir Putin or
   David Cameron. But Cruz, whose campaign website has a [17]section
   headed “[18]RESTORE THE CONSTITUTION,” believes that the Supreme Court
   has gone astray by refusing to enforce the original understanding of
   the Constitution. If he’s right, then he’s not eligible for the
   presidency.
