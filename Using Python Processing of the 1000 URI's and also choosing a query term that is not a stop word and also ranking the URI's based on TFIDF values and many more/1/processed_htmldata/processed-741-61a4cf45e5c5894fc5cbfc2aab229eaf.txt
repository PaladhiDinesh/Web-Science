Cruz Wanted a Border Wall in 2012 While Trump Was Still Lobbying for Amnesty

   [44]Donald Trump Supports Amnesty

A common claim by Donald Trump and his supporters is that he was talking
about building a wall before the other GOP candidates, Ted Cruz in
particular. This is 100% false. Ted Cruz was defending the building of the
border wall to a series of moderators in July, 2012. At that point, Trump was
on record as still supporting amnesty for illegal immigrants.

   The only defense that he and his supporters can muster is that he has
   “evolved” on his beliefs of nearly seven decades. This is awfully
   convenient, of course, considering that his new talking points match
   the narrative that is required to stir up what psychologists are
   calling the “authoritarian wing” of the Republican party. These are the
   Republicans who are angry about what the government is doing and who
   want someone strong to tell them what to think and how to act. It’s the
   daddy-issues wing of the party – those who know enough to want change
   but who don’t take the time to research the claims of their chosen
   candidate.

   These people won’t be reached. Instead, we’re appealing to the curious-
   but thoughtful-Republicans who are interested in hearing what Trump has
   to say but who won’t follow him blindly based upon the unlikely claim
   that he’s erased 67-years of liberalism just in time to be Mr.
   Conservative. They will research him and come to the conclusion that he
   was pro-amnesty less than two years before his infamous anti-immigrant
   rant when he launched his campaign.

     Congress must protect our borders first. Amnesty should be done only
     if the border is secure and illegal immigration has stopped.

     FLASHBACK: Donald Trump Tells Illegal Aliens: 'You've Convinced Me'

     If you believe Trump did a 180 on [51]#amnesty in less than 2 years,
     he probably owns swamp land in Florida to sell you.

   Meanwhile, consistent Ted Cruz has been fighting for a wall on the
   border for several years. Here’s a couple of instance against hostile
   audiences when he was making the difficult pitch for building a wall in
   front of people who clearly were against the concept.

   ide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

   Now, let’s take a look at three more videos. The first one was made by
   a super PAC supporting Cruz. Before you believe that it’s obviously
   going to be biased, it’s important to note that they’re using actual
   footage of Donald Trump and others over the years clearly stating what
   he truly believes.

   ide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

   Here’s my personal take on the two scenarios surrounding Donald Trump.
   Did he have a revelation after 66-years of life to reverse nearly all
   of his views, or is it more likely that he saw an opportunity to follow
   the Obama administration and achieve his personal goal of being
   President of the United States even if it meant denouncing his own
   perspectives and reinventing himself as a pseudo-conservative?

   ide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

   For those who don’t care what he thought for 66-years and believe that
   he’s against amnesty today, you should really take a closer look at
   what his actual policy on illegal immigration is. He’s actually to the
   left of a few candidates on the issue, particular Cruz.

   ide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

   Trump’s supporters will never look into the border wall or amnesty
   matters because the truth goes against the narrative they’ve been sold.
   However, if you’re undecided and believing that Trump is the gold
   standard for stopping illegal immigration, you should definitely do the
   research. Trump’s greatest ally is ignorance..

Winghunter
       2/8/16: Mark Levin: “Ted Cruz first had the idea to build a wall
       back on the border in 2011, before Donald Trump, and has been the
       only candidate whose opposition to amnesty has been unequivocal.
       The audio tape of Cruz talking about the wall is played on Levin’s
       show dated 2/8/16.
