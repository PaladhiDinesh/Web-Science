The Best Wrinkle Cream is Sunscreen

     * [29]12 Comments

   Note from Auntie Snail: This post was updated on 4/23/2015 to reflect
   some new information I’ve read about effective sunscreen quantities.

   I spent most of my twenties wondering why my face was still getting
   tanned (sun damage) and why I was still getting dark spots on my cheeks
   (sun damage) even though I tried to wear a moisturizer with SPF every
   day and sometimes even a CC cream with SPF. Then my thirties hit, and
   all that SUN DAMAGE (and my one really, really misguided year working
   in a tanning salon and using the tanning beds after closing up several
   nights a week) caught up to me.

   The thing I didn’t know–and that a lot of people don’t yet know–is that
   when it comes to sunscreen, quantity matters. The bottle might say SPF
   15, but unless you’re using at least the correct amount, you aren’t
   getting anywhere close to SPF 15 protection. You’re not going to get
   SPF 15 if you only use a few drops of your SPF 15 daily moisturizer,
   and you’re not going to get SPF 15 just because you dabbed on a bit of
   SPF 15 foundation or powder. Also: You’re not going to get SPF 15 (let
   alone 30, or 45, or 50) by layering on a little drop of SPF lotion here
   and a little swipe of SPF powder there. It doesn’t add up that way.

   If you want to prevent wrinkles and sunspots, you need to protect
   yourself from the sun, and if you want to protect yourself from the
   sun, you should be protecting yourself with adequate amounts of
   sunscreen every time you expose your face to the sun.

How much sunscreen do I need?

   What’s an adequate amount of sunscreen?

   It’s a lot.

   To get the advertised amount of SPF protection on a product’s label,
   whether it’s foundation or moisturizer or dedicated sunscreen, you need
   to wear about 2 mg/square centimeter of it just for your face. Hoojoo
   Beauty has a great, in-depth explanation of [30]sun protection to
   prevent sun damage, complete with graphs and discussion of other
   sunscreen technicalities, but what it boils down to is this: The
   general guidelines suggest that you need about 1/4 tsp of sunscreen for
   your face. These calculations were done using the facial surface
   area of men whose face sizes are in the 95th percentile, however. It is
   entirely possible that you could need less due to having a small face.
   In my opinion, though, it’s better to be safe than sorry (and sun
   damaged), and there isn’t that much variance in face sizes unless
   you’ve got a gigantic giant face or a teeny tiny itty witty bitty
   little pixie face, but keep it in mind and don’t get stressed if you
   think you’ve put on less.

   1/4 tsp can really seem like a lot the first few times. Get a 1/4 tsp
   measuring spoon and measure out any kind of lotion you have on hand.

   See?

   I’m used to it by now, so I just eyeball about a nickel-sized amount
   every day and apply it at the end of my morning [31]skincare routine. I
   rub it between my hands to distribute it on my palms, then swipe it
   over my face, avoiding my eyes, rub it in a bit, then let it absorb for
   about 15 minutes or so.

   Unfortunately, many people find that the sunscreens available to them
   at the drugstore just aren’t pleasant to use in the correct quantities.
   Thanks in part to the FDA’s slowness at approving newer sunscreen
   ingredients and in part to Western culture’s appreciation of a good
   tan, US sunscreen formulations tend to be less advanced and less
   cosmetically elegant than their counterparts manufactured by the
   Japanese and Korean skin care industries. Mass-market US sunscreens are
   often thick, greasy-feeling, and smell strongly of sunscreen. They also
   often leave a chalky white cast that just really doesn’t look right on
   anyone who’s not currently performing as a geisha.

   This is why many Asian skin care fans choose to import Japanese and
   Korean sunscreens by buying them online or having friends and family in
   Asia ship the good stuff over. Asian sunscreens are generally more
   pleasant to use in the recommended quantities: less greasy (some are
   even strongly mattifying), with less white cast or no white cast at
   all, and without that distinctive sunscreen smell that screams “I just
   went to the pool and my mom dumped a bottle of Coppertone on me.” I’m
   no expert, but I’m guessing that the reason Japanese and Korean
   sunscreens are so much better is due at least in part to the fanatical
   East Asian love of fair skin, which is in direct conflict with many
   Asian complexions’ tendency to tan easily.

   Another reason to look at Asian sunscreens is the fact that UVA
   protection is measured and printed on the labels. You’ll find it
   expressed as a PA rating with one or more plus signs after it, from PA+
   up to PA++++.

UVA protection and PA ratings: Why do they matter?

   In the US, sunscreens only need to show their SPF rating. SPF is a
   metric used to measure a sunscreen’s level of UVB protection. UVB rays
   are responsible for tanning, burning, and skin cancer, so SPF certainly
   is important. But UVA is also important, and apart from the “broad
   spectrum” designation that shows that a sunscreen has some UVA
   protection, US sunscreens don’t give any indication of just how much
   UVA protection they provide.

   Like UVB rays, UVA rays cause skin cancer. They’re also a prime
   contributor to sun damage and photoaging, so if you want to prevent
   wrinkles and slow down your skin’s aging process, you absolutely must
   have a good level of UVA protection. Also, UVA is still present in bad
   weather, since UVA rays penetrate cloud cover, so keep that in mind
   when you’re tempted to skip the sunscreen because it’s raining out.

   Hoojoo Beauty explains UV rays in more depth [32]here. For our
   purposes, the key takeaway should be to look at the PA rating on the
   Japanese or Korean sunscreen bottle. More pluses equals more
   protection. Japanese sunscreens go up to PA++++; Korean sunscreens only
   label up to PA+++, though that is more thanks to regulatory reasons and
   not because there are no Korean sunscreens with PA++++-equivalent
   protection. Since there’s not really a reliable way of knowing which
   Korean sunscreens are labeled PA+++ but actually equivalent to PA++++,
   however, I stick to Japanese sunscreens like Biore and Hada Labo for
   now. (Also, Biore and Hada Labo sunscreens are easily found on Amazon.)

   How do the different levels of PA protection break down? Here’s my
   take:
     * PA+: I wouldn’t wear this unless it was my last option and the
       zombie apocalypse had already happened so the state of my skin
       doesn’t matter anymore because I’m about to die. (Though I would
       like to know how Glenn is maintaining his smooth and undamaged skin
       in those zombie-riddled Atlanta summers.)
     * PA++: I guess it’s okay, if I’m in a pinch and have literally no
       higher sunscreen options to choose from. I’d definitely be sticking
       to the shade as much as possible.
     * PA+++: This is decent. I’d be afraid that the sunscreen I have is
       on the lower end of the spectrum, though, so I still avoid this.
     * PA++++: Ride or die.

   To sum it all up: If you want to prevent wrinkles, don’t rely on
   half-assed measures like a pearl-sized amount of SPF lotion. Cover your
   face in 1/4 tsp of a high-SPF, high-PA sunscreen every, rain or shine.
   I’ve been doing that for over a year now, and my skin condition has
   improved by leaps and bounds, with no new sun damage as far as I can
   see, while the rest of my routine assists in repairing the old sun
   damage I accumulated during my Lost Decade.

   And don’t forget to wear your shades! They’re the easiest way to
   prevent sunspots around your eyes and crow’s feet from squinting in
   bright light.

   Sun can’t hurt me when I’ve got my PA++++ sunscreen and shades on.

   Do you wear sunscreen every day? What’s your favorite brand?

       Yes! I’m a diehard sunscreen wearer, too. Currently using Nivea Sun
       Cream and Sekkisei UV Essence (both PA++++). So far, they are just
       okay, with an edge to the Nivea.

       Are we not allowed to put sunscreen on our eye area? Why??? What
       about protecting our eyes from wrinkles?

                 There’s actually a sunscreen stick that both Vichy and La
                 Roche Posay make for your eye area. I don’t know about
                 the Vichy one(but I assume they are both similar) but La
                 Roche Posay makes one with ppd 26 which I assume is quite
                 high and spf 50 if you want to try it. It’s very gentle
                 and doesn’t sting or make your eyes watery but it does
                 leave a bit of a white cast.

       What do you recommend to someone allergic to all/most chemical
       sunscreens? Do you know of any light (but well-working) mineral
       based sunscreens?

            Hiya! I don’t have a ton of experience with physical-only
            sunscreens, so I’m afraid I can’t help too much there. The
            only one I can think of off the top of my head is Atopita,
            which my buddy Joan at Kinseng reviewed here:

       hey fiddy! just this year I’m starting to embrace my sunscreen and
       wear it religiously everyday rain or shine. but since I read it
       almost everywhere that we have to reapply after two hours
       regardless the SPF, I wanna ask whether or not you reapply your
       sunscreen and if you do, do you reapply it, like, another 1/4 tsp
       or less? :/

            Hi! The reapplication guideline is actually to reapply for
            every 2 hours of sun exposure, not every 2 hours by the clock
            (whew, ain’t no one got time for that). I usually don’t
            reapply since I’m usually not out in the sun that much in a
            day, but when I do, I just squeeze out a bit less than 1/4 tsp
            and gently pat it in over my makeup :)

       Arrrrgggghhhh! I’ve just realized that all the time/money/energy
       and love i’ve given my skin in the past 12+ months has been
       practically negated by the suck-y sunscreens I use! Read this post,
       keep reading more of yours and others, did the research, and
       ordered the new Biore. I’m a korean skincare addict
       work-in-progress. Ugh.

            right? And I hope you like the Biore! I still haven’t even
            heard of one available to me that comes close to it <3

   #instamakeup [119]How about some gold for Valentine's Day? Not jewelry
   (that would take away from the #skincare budget!!), but the #Elizavecca
   Milky Piggy Kangsi Pack with 24K gold extract! This #kbeauty wash-off
   mask was sent to me by @Memebox_USA for their #brandambassador program.
   I don't take wash-off packs super seriously. As long as they are
   pleasant to use, non-irritating, and have some noticeable immediate
   benefit, I'm happy. Even better when the product is cute and fun, which
   this one is! @elizavecca_ masks are killer skincaretainment! I used
   this mask immediately after cleansing. It comes out of the tube as a
   soft, spreadable, sparkly golden goo that turns white and crumbly as it
   dries. Initially, it has a pretty but somewhat strong floral fragrance
   (not my favorite), but the fragrance dissipates very quickly after
   application. I put on a pretty thick layer, which took about 20 minutes
   to fully dry. At that point, the dry and cracking mask looked and felt
   just like a #claymask. It rinsed off much more easily than traditional
   clay masks, though, and didn't leave my skin feeling at all dry or
   tight. My face after rinsing felt super soft and hydrated. The clay
   component of the mask got my pores looking nice and clean, and my skin
   overall looked brighter, clearer, more even and more
   translucent--purified! I followed up with my regular morning routine
   and did some extra plumping with a sheet mask. Verdict: Many wash-off
   masks deliver the same results as the Elizavecca Kangsi Pack, but are
   those other wash-off masks as enjoyable to use? Probably not! I got a
   kick out of this unique mask and will definitely whip it out in future
   for an occasional treat. #fiftyshadesofsnail #rasianbeauty
