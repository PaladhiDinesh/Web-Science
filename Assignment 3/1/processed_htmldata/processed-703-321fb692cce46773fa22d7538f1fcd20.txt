   For Charles and David Koch (left and right, respectively), it has
   become hard to buy a presidential election.
   “Everything is on the table,” says one source. That includes sitting
   out 2016.
   by
     * [26]Daniel Schulman

   “You’d think we could have more influence,” Charles Koch [27]told the
   F.T. last month over pulled-pork sandwiches at the staff commissary of
   Koch Industries in Wichita, Kansas. The wealthy industrialist and
   conservative impresario was giving a rare interview in support of his
   new book, but his disillusionment with the state of the Republican
   presidential race (and politics in general) was apparent. In 2012, he
   and his younger brother, David Koch, raised approximately $400 million
   through their donor network with the primary goal of electing Mitt
   Romney—only to be outmaneuvered in the end by Barack Obama’s campaign.
   During the intervening years, the Kochs’ political operatives studied
   what had gone wrong in 2012 and redoubled their efforts to ensure that
   the same fate would not befall them again. By the start of the 2016
   election cycle, the brothers and their allies had pledged to raise
   nearly $900 million to elect Republicans, particularly whomever ends up
   facing Hillary Clinton—or, perhaps, Bernie Sanders—in the general
   election.

   But things don't seem to be working out as smoothly as planned. Like
   other members of the Republican elite, the Koch brothers misjudged
   Donald Trump. They never considered the real estate scion a serious
   contender, and his politics on taxes, trade, and foreign policy clashed
   thoroughly with theirs. (Charles Koch noted that Trump’s Muslim
   registry, for instance, would “destroy our free society.”) Even when
   Trump, who has known David for years, sought their support—going as far
   as hiring Corey Lewandowski, a veteran of their advocacy group,
   Americans for Prosperity, as his campaign manager—the Kochs rebuffed
   him. Then Trump turned on them. When the Koch network left Trump off
   the invite list for an August donor summit attended by five of his
   G.O.P. rivals, he [28]trolled his opponents on Twitter: “I wish good
   luck to all of the Republican candidates that traveled to California to
   beg for money etc. from the Koch Brothers. Puppets?”

   Charles Koch’s candid lament at the office canteen drew predictable
   ridicule from critics on the left, who found it deliciously ironic
   coming from a billionaire marshaling hundreds of millions of dollars to
   sway the election. But the comment also revealed a different irony: the
   Kochs, after building a shadow party on the right, are now struggling
   to gain traction in a political landscape they have helped to bring
   into existence.

   This election cycle was supposed to be the one in which the Koch
   network fulfilled its mission of installing a Republican in the White
   House. But that goal, and the millions behind it, are at risk. And
   before the Kochs begin to take on Hillary or Bernie, they are carefully
   considering whether to wage a war against Trump.

   The Kochs had initially opted against engaging in the primaries, both
   because there was no consensus pick within their network or a single
   candidate who encapsulated their views. (The closest one,
   ideologically, was Rand Paul, who [29]dropped out of the race on
   Wednesday.) But for months, the Koch network has considered diverting a
   portion of its massive war chest to a campaign targeting Trump, even at
   the risk of alienating a handful of their members who support the
   candidate. Koch officials say they will move forward with this plan
   based on how the early primaries shake out. (Ted Cruz’s caucus win on
   Monday must have come as a mild relief.)

   But Trump’s second-place Iowa finish was more a blow to his ego, in
   some respect, than the viability of his campaign. If he prevails in New
   Hampshire, where he’s maintaining a huge lead in the polls, pressure is
   likely to mount within the Koch network to launch an offensive before a
   march to the nomination gains formidable momentum. When the Kochs and
   several hundred of their allies gathered last weekend for another
   summit, halting Trump was a major topic of discussion.

   What form might this attack take? According to The Hill, the Kochs’
   operatives [30]have carefully assessed Trump’s vulnerabilities—and
   those of the other candidates—and determined that highlighting his
   track record of bankruptcies and predatory business deals harms his
   standing with likely voters. (The Democrats deployed a similar
   strategy, to great effect, against Romney’s “vulture capitalism.”) “As
   to whether we would mount something like that, everything is on the
   table,” one senior Koch official told me. “But there’s no real plan. In
   all of our meetings we’ve discussed it.”

   One thing that has held the Koch network back so far, in addition to
   the Trump backers within their ranks, is the concern that taking on
   Trump would inevitably draw the thin-skinned tycoon’s legendary
   invective, which it almost certainly would. If the Kochs go after
   Trump, rest assured that he will take every opportunity to highlight
   how he’s being attacked by a cabal of billionaires seeking to control
   the outcome of the election. And this more or less explains their
   caution to this point. By taking on Trump, the Kochs risk lending
   credence to his claims of being an outsider who is battling against a
   corrupt political system rigged by the elites.

   The bizarro-world nature of the 2016 race is confounding to Charles
   Koch, an iron-willed, M.I.T.-trained engineer who has devoted his life
   to the twin goals of expanding his family-owned conglomerate and
   disseminating the gospel of the free market. Koch, who rejects party
   labels and describes himself as a “classical liberal,” has been on a
   long—often frustrating—quest to change the political culture of the
   United States. Starting in the 70s, the Kochs had set out to demolish
   the two-party political system by backing the insurgent Libertarian
   Party. Eventually, they abandoned this quixotic effort while pursuing
   the more pragmatic strategy of working through the Republican Party
   structure in the hopes of eventually nudging it closer to their
   libertarian worldview.

   And this seemed to be working. By methodically constructing a sprawling
   operation with all the trappings (and more) of a traditional political
   party—from fundraising to micro-targeting to candidate recruitment—the
   Kochs had eventually obtained political power by decentralizing it.
   Their ascendance came as a series of court decisions, including
   Citizens United v. F.E.C., stripped away restrictions that had
   prevented corporations and individuals from giving freely in support of
   political candidates and causes. The effect was to create a new, and to
   some frightening, brand of politics in which wealthy donors held more
   sway over the political process than at any time since the Gilded Age.
   The Kochs, with their organized network of fellow mega-donors, were
   emblematic of this shift away from party power. Who needed a political
   party when you and your friends could simply create your own?

   In their own way, the Kochs inspired other donors to consider
   alternative outlets for their advocacy. No longer do wealthy
   contributors have to rely on crusty party institutions. They are free,
   together and separately, to pursue their own agendas with as much money
   as they can bear to part with. Hedge-fund mogul Paul Singer, a Koch
   network member who is backing Marco Rubio, is among those who have
   applied the Koch model to create a group of contributors to concentrate
   on his own set of pet issues, including supporting Republican
   candidates who back same-sex marriage. But you don’t even need a
   network to have an impact. Consider that the extraordinarily
   well-funded outside-spending campaign supporting Cruz is bankrolled
   almost entirely by a pair of fracking billionaires and two investment
   tycoons.

   The real irony, of course, is that the rise of the maverick mega-donor
   class, which the Kochs helped pioneer, may inevitably dilute their
   clout. There is now an unprecedented flood of money, from competing
   interests and factions, coursing into the political system. By adopting
   the characteristics of a political party and remaining mostly neutral
   up to this point on the Republican race, the Kochs are losing some
   relevance—as is the Republican Party, whose dominance they successfully
   challenged.

   Trump’s candidacy could force a reckoning within the Koch network,
   whose members are largely leaning towards Rubio and Cruz. If Trump
   becomes the nominee and he faces self-declared socialist Bernie Sanders
   in November, the senior Koch official explains, members of the donor
   network are likely to hold their noses and back Trump’s candidacy. But
   there’s another scenario that could prove far more controversial and
   possibly damaging for the network: a Trump-versus-Clinton matchup.
   There is absolutely no love between the Clintons and the Kochs, whose
   company experienced one of the most traumatic periods in its history as
   it fought off regulators during Bill Clinton’s presidency. But, so
   strong is the dislike for Trump within the Koch network, that a
   Clinton-Trump race is a tough call. “I could see the network not
   participating in the presidential election at all,” says the senior
   Koch official. Such a decision would likely cause some donors to part
   ways with the Kochs, particularly those who are committed to electing a
   Republican at any cost.

   The uncertainties facing the Kochs and their allies—and their decision
   about whether to take on Trump before it’s too late—reflects a
   surprising, and perhaps heartening, reality within our political
   system. Even for America’s most powerful billionaires, buying an
   election is not as easy as it sounds.
