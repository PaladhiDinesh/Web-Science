UW-W Walmart Athletes of the Week

   For the week of February 1 - 7, 2016:

   MEN'S BASKETBALL
   15921

   [101]Trinson White (Milwaukee, Wis./Riverside), Senior, Forward
   White averaged 21.0 points, 8.0 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game last
   week to help the Warhawks move up to a tie for fourth place in the WIAC
   standings. He tallied a game-high 23 points on 7-of-11 shooting from
   the floor and 7-of-8 at the free-throw line and grabbed seven rebounds
   as UW-Whitewater finished a season sweep of UW-Stevens Point with a
   72-51 victory on the road last Wednesday. Three days later, White
   posted 19 points, including 14 in the second half, and added nine
   rebounds and four assists against first-place UW-La Crosse at Kachel
   Gymnasium.

   WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
   15732

   [102]Abbie Reeves (Salem/Westosha Central), Senior, Guard
   Reeves recorded 17.5 points and 3.0 rebounds per game and shot 12-of-21
   (57.1 percent) from the floor to help the No. 15 Warhawks split a pair
   of games last week. She tallied a game-high 23 points on 9-of-14
   shooting to help UW-Whitewater to a 73-55 victory at UW-La Crosse on
   Saturday. Reeves finished with 12 points and hit 5-of-5 at the
   free-throw line Wednesday against 16th-ranked UW-Stevens Point. Over
   her last four games, she is averaging 17 points and has hit 13
   three-pointers.

   GYMNASTICS
   16061

   Specialist
   [103]Mackenzie Smith (Milwaukee, Wis./Martin Luther), Junior
   Smith won the uneven parallel bars with a season-best score of 9.725,
   which tied for the 11th best mark in program history, to help the
   Warhawks defeat Gustavus Adolphus (Minn.) 189.100-178.750 on Saturday
   at Russell Arena. Her performance helped UW-Whitewater post a
   season-high score on the bars of 48.100, the No. 3 score in the school
   record book. Smith's consistency on the bars over the last two weeks –
   she also registered a 9.725 at Division I Southeast Missouri State on
   Jan. 29 – has helped her increase her season average in the event to
   9.508
   16067 All-Around
   [104]Courtney Pickett (Brentwood, TN/Brentwood), Junior
   Pickett matched her season high score with a 38.100, the 19th-best
   score in school history, to win the all-around competition and help the
   Warhawks defeat Gustavus Adolphus (Minn.) 189.100-178.750 in a dual
   meet Saturday at Russell Arena. She won both the balance beam (9.600)
   and the floor exercise (9.575), finished third on the vault (9.475) and
   placed fifth on the uneven parallel bars (9.450). Pickett's tally on
   the bars helped UW-Whitewater post a season-best 48.100, the third-best
   score in the event in program history.

   [105]Brett Harms (Whitewater, Wis./Whitewater), Sophomore
   Harms won the 1-mile run with a career-best time of 4:21.05 to help the
   No. 6 Warhawks win the seven-team Pointer Invitational on Saturday at

   also helped UW-Whitewater's 4x400-meter relay team post a 3:34.47 to
   finish fifth in the event.

   dash to help the sixth-ranked Warhawks win the seven-team Pointer
   Invitational on Saturday at UW-Stevens Point. His long jump mark of
   24-00.25 (7.32m) ranks No. 1 in the nation by more than three inches.
   Starnes ran a career-best time of 7.10 in the 60 preliminary race and
   finished with a 7.18 in the final. He now ranks No. 1 in the nation in

   Her result currently ranks 30th in the WIAC.
