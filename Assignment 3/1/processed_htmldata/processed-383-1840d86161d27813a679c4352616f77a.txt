Can hiring ex-offenders make a business more profitable?

   Companies that hire former inmates say those employees are often model
   workers who are eager to prove themselves. But many businesses remain
   wary of giving ex-offenders a chance

   More than 65 million people in the US have a criminal record. Now, a
   growing number of US companies are hiring former inmates, a move that
   industry leaders say is good for business and society.

   Jimmy Erickson went to prison for a violent felony when he was 25. When
   he was released, at 46, he felt reformed and determined to build a new
   life. A month and a half later, he got a job with Butterball Farms, a
   Michigan company with a track record of hiring former prisoners.

   Erickson has now been with Butterball for seven years and has received
   several promotions. He married and bought a home. At first, Erickson
   says, he battled against a constant anxiety that everyone knew about
   his criminal history and judged him for it. So he concentrated on
   proving himself from the moment he was hired.

   “At first I was apprehensive about trying to form relationships with
   people, but I had the mindset that this was my opportunity,” he says.
   “I’d work my shift and whenever they needed someone to stay over, I
   volunteered. Anything they asked me to do, I did it.”

   Butterball represents a growing number of companies hiring former
   inmates. Major corporations like Target, Home Depot, [47]Walmart and
   Koch Industries have joined more than 100 cities and 19 states in
   passing “ban the box” legislation to prohibit employers from requiring
   job applicants to check a box indicating whether they have a criminal
   record. Checking that box often leads to automatic exclusion from
   consideration without the opportunity to explain the nature of the
   crime.

   Instead, more companies wait until later in the interview process to
   ask about criminal history, a change aimed at giving those with a
   record a fair chance to compete for jobs. In November, the Obama
   administration followed suit, taking executive action to “ban the box”
   in federal hiring. And, just last week, a bipartisan congressional task
   force on prison reform[48] released a report calling for stronger
   employment and other programs to help ex-offenders reenter society.

   urged

   Most people coming out of the prison system don’t have the smooth
   transition to employment that Erickson had. A [50]2009 study found that
   up to 75% of ex-offenders were unemployed as long as a year after
   release. Employer surveys show that [51]almost 90% of large companies
   do employee background checks, and most are not willing to hire someone
   with a criminal record.

   “Six or seven years ago, employers looked at you like maybe you had a
   screw loose when you talked about hiring ex-offenders,” said Joyce
   White Vance, US attorney for the Northern District in Alabama who has
   worked with the Birmingham Business Alliance to encourage hiring of
   ex-offenders. “Now it’s much more part of the mainstream conversation.”

   Law enforcement officials, civil rights organizations and business
   leaders say giving former inmates a better shot at employment is good
   for business and society. More than 65 million people in the US have a
   criminal record, from low-level property crimes to violent
   felonies.[52] More than 600,000 are released from prison every year.
   Excluding such a large group of people from the employment pool, they
   say, is impractical and bad for the economy,[53] costing tens of
   billions of dollars annually.

   Some businesses simply see it as the right thing to do, realizing that
   those who have criminal records face an uphill battle to find jobs and
   frequently end up back in the legal system partly because they couldn’t
   find work to support themselves. In fact, cutting the skyrocketing cost
   of running prisons, which house nearly 2.4 million inmates nationwide,
   has been a major incentive for finding employment for former prisoners,
   Vance says.

   Employers are finding that by being more inclusive, they are benefiting
   from employees like Erickson who are determined to excel.

   “We’ve found that just by us giving that opportunity, a lot of people
   so appreciate it that what we get back as a company in return is much
   greater than what we ever gave in the beginning,” says Bonnie Mrozcek,
   chief talent officer for Butterball Farms.

   Butterball is a leader in the effort to get more so-called returning
   citizens into stable employment. But its original motive wasn’t
   strictly altruistic, says Mroczek – 20 years ago, Butterball was having
   trouble filling positions and wanted to expand the applicant pool. The
   company discovered ex-offenders were great workers with lower turnover
   rates on average than other employees.

   The company began to champion for hiring former inmates but found
   strong resistance from the business community. So in 2012, Butterball,
   based in Grand Rapids, started the[54] 30-2-2 initiative, which set out
   to get 30 employers in its hometown to hire a minimum of two former
   inmates and track their job performance for two years, hoping to show
   other businesses that ex-offenders could be desirable, competitive
   applicants.

   These days, companies in the initiative are also working with job
   placement services and staffing agencies to find suitable job
   candidates. Now the 30-2-2 program is [55]being adopted in New Orleans.

   colleague, the bank robber

   Matching businesses with potential employees remains a significant
   challenge overall. Agencies that offer skill training to former
   prisoners historically lack the staff to build a strong relationship
   with local businesses and place job seekers. But that’s changing with
   more funding from the US Department of Labor to fund those liaisons,
   says Stephanie Akhter, the re-entry and employment project manager at
   the Council of State Governments Justice Center.

   A patchwork of state and federal regulations that are intended to
   ensure public safety have also created a major barrier for ex-offenders
   to find work. Those rules typically impose restrictions on voting,
   access to housing, public benefits and jobs, but they sometimes create
   unintended consequences. A classic example is that many states prevent
   formerly incarcerated people from working as barbers and stylists, even
   though these are common job training programs in prisons. A[57]
   national study by the American Bar Association identified a staggering
   38,000 state and federal statutes that impose such consequences on
   people convicted of crimes, the majority pertaining to employment.

   Many businesses remain wary about hiring people with a criminal past
   because they worry that ex-offenders pose safety risks, says Madeline
   Neighly, a senior policy advisor for corrections and reentry at CSG
   Justice Center. Some businesses also cite concerns about getting sued
   by other employees for failing to conduct a good background check if
   the former inmates they hired turned out to be problem workers. But,
   according to Neighly, there is little evidence that this represents a
   significant risk, and some states now have regulations to shield
   employers from negligent hiring claims.

   “It’s natural for people to have a stigma, but once you expose hiring
   managers or executives to real people, it diffuses the stigma,” says
   David Rattray, executive vice president for education and workforce
   development at the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, which is part of a
   pilot program, [58]Back on Track LA, that helps ex-offenders get jobs
   and education. The chamber hired two former inmates and hosted a summit
   last fall to line up support for the program. It also takes members on
   tour of the local jail to dispel stereotypes.

   “It’s not a simple ‘just add water’ solution,” Rattray says. “But if we
   do it at the LA Chamber, I think we will get more and more employers
   learning from other employers and us, and choosing this option.”
