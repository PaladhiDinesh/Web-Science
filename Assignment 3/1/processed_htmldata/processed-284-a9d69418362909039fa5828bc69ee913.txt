   BRONX — A man was slashed in the face Saturday morning as he left the
   West Farms Square-East Tremont Avenue subway station after an argument
   with two other men, police said.

   The 32-year-old victim was slashed in the right cheek with an unknown
   object just before 4 a.m., police said.

   The attack followed an argument between the victim and two other men,
   according to authorities.

   The victim was taken to [94]St. Barnabas Hospital, where he received
   stitches and was released, police said.

   The [95]NYPD said there is no indication the victim knew his attacker
   before the assault.

   No arrests had been made as of Monday morning, police said.

   The incident follows a [96]series of slashings this year across New
   York, including multiple attacks in the subway system.
