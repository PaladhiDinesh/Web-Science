Holding Back China's Capital Flight ‘Dam’ Is Key

   China Debate: FX Reserves vs. Economic Reforms
     * Reserves fell more than $200 billion over last two months
     * Households have yet to show signs of rush to put money abroad

   The decline in China’s foreign-currency reserves to a four-year low,
   even without evidence of widespread domestic capital flight, adds
   pressure on policy makers to strengthen the economy through fiscal
   easing and structural reforms.

   China’s reserves, once a continuously rising hoard, fell $99.5 billion
   in January, continuing a slump from 2015 as the People’s Bank of China
   sought to shore up the yuan. While estimates of the sources of the
   hard-currency outflows differ, much of the total is thought to be
   pay-downs of foreign debt. A much bigger threat -- "the dam that the
   PBOC must make sure doesn’t break," according to Frederic Neumann at
   HSBC Holdings Plc -- would be an exodus of funds from domestic
   investors.

   "The worst fears of cascading capital flight have not come to pass,"
   Tom Orlik, a Bloomberg Intelligence economist, wrote after the reserves
   report on Sunday, noting that the drop was less than some had
   anticipated. "Households are not maxing out their $50,000 annual quota
   for FX purchases."

   That puts a premium on maintaining confidence in the outlook, amid
   volatility in the stock market and a trenchant decline in old-line
   industries including shipbuilding as China shifts its economy toward
   services and consumption. Continued progress in merging enterprises and
   shutting down loss-making units would help ease pressure on the yuan,
   according to China International Capital Corp.

   "Elimination of excess capacity will weigh on economic growth in the
   short term, but will improve the efficiency of resource allocation and
   boost confidence in China’s economy and the renminbi," CICC economists
   including Bian Quanshui wrote in a note last month.

   To help ensure growth doesn’t fall below the 6.5 percent minimum pace
   identified by President Xi Jinping, fiscal policy has greater scope
   than monetary policy, given that interest-rate cuts could undermine the
   yuan.

   With finance chiefs from the world’s biggest economies set to gather in
   Shanghai later this month, the U.S. has been among those calling for
   fiscal measures that would support the leadership’s own consumption
   goals.

   China’s annual gathering of its legislature, the National People’s
   Congress, may shed light on the government’s fiscal plans. Last year,
   one focus of the conference was efforts to overhaul local government
   debt to allow provincial authorities to be more supportive of spending
   and growth.

Breathing Space

   Meantime, China’s financial markets will be closed this week for
   celebrations of the Lunar New Year, giving authorities some breathing
   space. The country’s reserves stockpile fell by more than half a
   trillion dollars in 2015, the first-ever annual decline, raising
   questions about how iron-clad the buffer is.

   “While the remaining reserves represent a substantial war chest, the
   rapid pace of depletion in recent months is simply unsustainable,”
   said Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist at IHS Global Insight
   in Singapore. “Domestic private investors and global currency traders
   see a one-way bet against the currency. This has resulted in
   large-scale private capital outflows since early 2015 as expectations
   mount that the PBOC will eventually be forced to capitulate once its
   reserves are sufficiently depleted.”

   China increased its gold hoard in January, raising its holdings to
   57.18 million ounces at it looks to diversify its foreign-exchange
   stockpile. Analysts including Orlik and those at Goldman Sachs Group
   Inc. noted that the PBOC might have accumulated forward positions in
   the currency market or used other entities, such as commercial banks,
   to absorb capital-outflow pressures and cushion the yuan’s drop --
   items that wouldn’t immediately show up in the January reserves data.

   The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey is for the yuan to fall to
   6.76 a dollar by the end of this year, with Rabobank Group the most
   pessimistic with a 7.53 prediction. The currency has declined 1.24
   percent so far this year, closing at 6.5755 in Shanghai on Friday.

   "Bloomberg Intelligence Economics’ base case remains that the People’s
   Bank of China will keep a close hold of the yuan through this period of
   selling pressure," Orlik wrote Sunday.
