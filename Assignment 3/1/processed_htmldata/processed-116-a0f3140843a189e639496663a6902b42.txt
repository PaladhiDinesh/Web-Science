Subway rider Randy Aveille, 44, was attacked at the Church Ave. subway stop
in Brooklyn by a man who called him a “cracka.”

   A 44-year-old white straphanger was beaten in a Brooklyn subway station
   by a black man who told him, “Cracka, you don’t belong here,” police
   sources told the Daily News.

   The suspect also allegedly elbowed the victim’s fiancée in the head,
   then spit in another straphangers’ face.

   “Someone get his white cracka ass off the floor,’’ the suspect said,
   according to police sources. “It’s a black neighborhood ... You don’t
   belong here.”

   The incident, which happened about 9:45 p.m. Saturday at the Church
   Ave. stop, is being investigated by the NYPD’s Hate Crimes Task Force.
   No arrest has been made.

   The victim was getting off the train when the suspect, believed to be
   about 40 years old, approached from behind and allegedly punched him in
   the face. He knocked him to the ground and called him a “cracka,” a
   derogatory term for white people, police sources said.

The incident happened about 9:45 p.m. Saturday at the Church Ave. stop in
Brooklyn.

   When the victim’s fiancée tried to intervene the suspect allegedly
   elbowed her, walked away and confronted another subway rider, who told
   cops about the incident.

   The victim’s nose was bloodied and his right eye was bruised but he did
   not require medical treatment, police sources said.

   The NYPD has classified the attack as a bias incident.
