Property owners of proposed Walmart development sue Edmond

   Wed Feb 03 07:26:39 EST 2016 | NewsOk
   EDMOND — Covell Creek LLC, the owner of property at Covell and Coltrane
   roads where Walmart proposed a Neighborhood Market, has filed a lawsuit
   against the city of Edmond. The petition, filed in Oklahoma County
   District Court on Tuesday, challenges the city council's  decision on
   Jan. 11 to deny a Walmart site plan appeal to build the grocery store.
   The decision came after more than two hours of discussion with 17
   homeowners speaking against the 41,952-square-foot business. ..
