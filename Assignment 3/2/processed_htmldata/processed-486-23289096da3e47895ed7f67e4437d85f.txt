Wal-Mart Heir Gives Clinton $335,000

   Hillary WALLY

   Hillary Clinton on Walmart’s Board of Directors

   NATIONAL (VFB) – Less than two weeks after the world’s largest retailer
   [27]Walmart announced it would raise hourly wages for U.S. workers to
   $10 an hour, election filings released Sunday show Walmart heir Alice
   Walton gave [28]$335,000 to Hillary Clinton’s so-called “Victory Fund.”

   The political donation, given in December, immediately caught the
   attention of Senator Bernie Sanders who wasted no time hammering the
   [29]former Walmart Board Member Clinton.

     A main characters in Sanders' stump speech is the Walton family
     (WalMart). Alice Walton gave Clinton's DNC/state party fund ~$350k
     in Dec.

     — Gabriel Debenedetti (@gdebenedetti) [30]February 2, 2016

   For years, Sanders has been an outspoken critic of Walmart’s massive
   corporate welfare. That’s because the nation’s largest private sector
   employer is also the [31]biggest consumer of [32]taxpayer supported
   aid.

     I got a message for the Walton family of Walmart: Get off of welfare
     and pay your workers a living wage.

     — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) [33]January 19, 2016

   As more Americans learn that they’re being forced to
   [34]subsidize corporate greed, the federal minimum wage, which
   currently sits at $7.25/hr, has become a central theme of the election
   (for Democrats).

   Bernie Sanders has [35]consistently advocated for a $15/hr [36]federal
   minimum wage.

     The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation
     wage and must be raised to a living wage of $15 an hour.

     — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) [37]January 28, 2016

     .[38]@BernieSanders: "We are going to raise the minimum wage to 15
     bucks an hour." [39]#IowaCaucus [40]pic.twitter.com/2xrrBNIe01

     — FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) [41]February 2, 2016

   On the other hand, Hillary Clinton, who [42]gets paid $300,000 for a
   single speech, is against a $15/hr wage, and has said $12/hr is
   sufficient.

     Sanders calls for $15 an hour minimum wage, Clinton backs $12 an
     hour [43]https://t.co/LMgdqqOQ4z [44]#DemDebate

     — Bloomberg Business (@business) [46]November 15, 2015

     In spin room, Clinton's campaign manager explains why she supports
     $12 minimum wage, as opposed to $15. [47]#DemDebate
     [48]https://t.co/Ilh1Sk9tWG

     — CBSN (@CBSNLive) [49]November 15, 2015

   Back to the Walmart donations…

   Walmart claims [50]the raise from $9 to $10/hr [51]will cost the
   company $1.5 billion.

   That means:
   A $12/hr minimum (Clinton’s plan) would cost Walmart $3 billion/yr.
   A $15/hr minimum (Bernie’s plan) would cost Walmart $7.5 billion/yr.

   So even though Clinton and the Walton klan [52]go way back, donations
   to her “Victory-fund”  are merely an [53]investment in the retail
   giant’s future. Every year under Clinton’s $12/hr wage plan, Walmart
   would stand to earn an additional $3 billion.

     Walton, Benioff join billionaires backing Clinton in 2016 |

       Well skip the innuendo and go ask the woman why she’s sending her
       money to Hillary. Whe might be surprised what she tells us. I know
       it doens’t have anything to do with vets. Maybe business things
       Bernie is too draconian and and isn’t being reasonable. Maybe it IS
       just about $3 an hour…but I expect is bigger than that.
       Maybe she really wants the Republicans to win so she doesn’t want
       them facing a more powerful Hillary.
       I’m not sure all things are clear here.
