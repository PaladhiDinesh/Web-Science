Trump and Sanders are doing so well because they tap into the same anxiety

   Last summer, as America fawned over Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders,
   the media dismissed them as unelectable—reasonable-seeming bets given
   Sanders’s socialism and Trump’s chronic offense-giving. But after both
   took second place in the Iowa caucuses, Sanders and Trump are now on
   track to win the New Hampshire primaries for their respective parties
   (or so say the polls). The men have something else in common too:
   outrage at trade policies that have hurt America’s middle class.

   Of course, populist upstarts like Ross Perot and Ralph Nader have
   flared up in past elections—but they ran as third-party candidates.
   Sanders and Trump are seriously challenging their parties’ mainstream
   contenders. It’s an imperfect measure, but if you combine their vote
   shares in the Iowa caucuses and the [25]average of the New Hampshire
   polls, the Sanders-Trump populist bloc beats out the aggregate share of
   establishment candidates (namely, Hillary Clinton, Marco Rubio, John
   Kasich, Chris Christie, and Jeb Bush) and conservatives (Ted Cruz and
   Ben Carson).

   It’s probably no coincidence that both campaigns are resonating with
   voters in a way they haven’t in the recent past. Over the course of the
   last decade or so, changes in the US economy have crept from hurting
   primarily working-class households to undermining middle-class
   households too, says John Russo, visiting scholar at the Kalmanovitz
   Initiative for Labor and Working Poor at Georgetown University.

   The share of the US families occupying America’s middle class (meaning,
   three-person households earning $42,000-126,000, in 2014 dollars) has
   [26]withered rapidly, according Pew Research Center. In absolute terms,
   more people have slid into society’s poorest class than have graduated
   to the upper-class tier.

   There’s now a “critical mass” of households suffering economic
   insecurity that now includes both income groups, Russo told Quartz.

   “The way it’s talked about [by both candidates] is not terribly
   dissimilar. Sanders has a lot to say about trade; you hear the same
   thing coming from Trump,” he says. “There’s a similarity in terms of
   two types of populism that are out there now and I think it stems from
   the politics of resentment and the decline in the American dream.”

   Russo isn’t the only one to notice that shared emphasis on “fair
   trade.” A few days ago, [27]Trump told CNN that he and Sanders “very
   much agree” on trade. Both men argue that the US’s knee-jerk promotion
   of free trade and corporate investment overseas has shifted decently
   paying jobs abroad.

   And those are hardly the only eerie commonalities. Both want to offer
   [28]universal healthcare, expand social security, and increase
   infrastructure investment. They reject receiving corporate campaign
   donations and openly scorn the media.

   Of course, there are also gaping differences in how Trump and Sanders
   address growing middle-class resentment. For example, Trump’s bête
   noire is immigrants who are [29](supposedly) taking American jobs.
   Sanders, meanwhile, whips up outrage at the banks for squandering
   wealth and at the rich for not paying enough taxes. But the fieriness
   of rhetoric? Plenty similar.
