How Tom Brady and Deflategate Explain Donald Trump's New Hampshire Appeal

Call it the ideal gas theory of politics.

   New Hampshire voters are angry. They believe a corrupt and power-hungry
   band of millionaire and billionaire families are running America into
   the ground, led by a coddled, vindictive, and dictatorial leader who
   doesn't share their values and won't help them win again.

   Which is why they think NFL commissioner Roger Goodell needs to go.

   "I'd like to moon him," said Roberto Cassotto of Hampton, New
   Hampshire, as he waited in line for a Donald Trump rally on Thursday in
   Portsmouth.

   One year ago this week, the NFL began investigating allegations that
   the New England Patriots illegally deflated footballs ahead of the 2014
   AFC championship game. The league suspended Patriots quarterback Tom
   Brady for four games, fined the organization, and docked it two draft
   picks; Brady's suspension was later overturned by a federal judge. In
   the 12 months since, "Deflategate" has transformed Boston sports radio
   into the football equivalent of InfoWars, falling deeper and deeper
   into the realm of conspiracy theory. Deflategate's version of the
   [28]melting point of steel is the Ideal Gas Law, which posits that
   extreme cold weather—of the variety that New England experiences in
   January—will naturally deflate balls.

   Now, as Trump tries to hold off a pack of challengers in the Granite
   State, he's hoping to get a boost from a powerful voting bloc—aggrieved
   New England Patriots fans whose suspicions of the NFL fit neatly with
   their suspicions of Washington. Other candidates have tried to channel
   enthusiasm for the Pats into a New Hampshire win. Ohio Gov. John Kasich
   brought Patriots legend Mike Vrabel (an Ohio State grad) with him to a
   town hall in Bedford. Marco Rubio has promised to appoint Brady to his
   cabinet. (An exception to this is Jeb Bush, who touted the endorsement
   of Peyton Manning, Brady's rival, ahead of Super Bowl Sunday; oh, Jeb.)
   But no one has been more shameless about playing the Pats card than
   Trump, who tells every audience he sees—even outside New England—about
   his friendship with Brady, who kept a "Make America Great Again" hat in
   his Patriots locker and told reporters that he considered Trump a
   "friend."

   "I'm a friend of Tom Brady, very good friend, and he was so nice to
   me," Trump told an [29]Iowa radio host last month. "Because he said,
   you saw what he said a couple weeks ago. He called, he said, 'Trump is
   the greatest winner.' When you get that, and then all of sudden in
   Massachusetts.…we got poll numbers that were 52 percent." Trump has
   been one of Brady's loudest Deflategate defenders, calling the NFL's
   punishment "[30]ridiculous."

   The NFL really has presented no solid evidence the balls were deflated
   by the Patriots. Unlike jet fuel melting steel, the Ideal Gas Law is a
   real thing that anyone who's driven in a northern winter can understand
   pretty easily. Brady was suspended for refusing to turn over his
   cellphone to investigators, not because of the results of the
   investigation itself. As an [31]ESPN investigation coldly documented,
   the clearest explanation for all of this is that the NFL felt it went
   too easy on the Patriots for a different scandal a decade ago and went
   a little overboard. Patriots fans have a simpler explanation for why
   their team is being persecuted: "They hate us 'cause as they ain't us,"
   one Trump supporter told me.

   On sports radio, where conservative candidates go fishing for voters
   (in an hour and a half on Friday morning, I heard four pro-Cruz ads and
   one pro-Fiorina spot), they're talking about nothing else. Hosts and
   their callers have begun to think the whole saga in distinctly
   political, if not outright religious terms. Someone on a midday program
   suggested the Patriots hire former George W. Bush spokesman Ari
   Fleischer to defend the team's reputation in public, and a team of
   crack investigators to dig up opposition research on Goodell and feed
   it to journalists. When New York Times magazine scribe Mark Leibovich
   called into the "Dennis and Callahan" show to discuss a [32]recent
   profile of Goodell, one of the hosts confessed that the whole league
   management reminded him of Scientology.

   The foil to Brady is Manning, whose own indiscretions (the [33]alleged
   purchase of human growth hormone) Pats fans believe have been swept
   under the rug by the establishment, which is to say the league office.
   Deflategate started as a sports story, but it's becoming spiraled into
   something bigger—a story about a group of Americans who are sick and
   tired of a powerful and corrupt cabal picking winners and losers.

   When I asked Jerry Elward, a Trump supporter who lives just across the
   state line in Wells, Maine, whom he considered more corrupt, Roger
   Goodell or President Barack Obama, he didn't hesitate: "Goodell." "Not
   very honorable," Elward said. "I look at Trump the other way—very
   honorable."

   You get the picture. Tom Brady isn't the single reason any of these
   folks are supporting Trump, but he is a useful stand-in for why they
   are.

   "They should be together, like, Brady for vice president!" Cassotto
   told me. "I think Brady should throw a touchdown pass to Trump just as
   he goes up for his inaugural address. Brady should be on the other end
   of the stage and it should be a long bomb to Trump! And [Trump] should
   hold it up in the air," Cassotto continued, his hands up above his head
   ready to haul one in. "'America is great once again.'"
