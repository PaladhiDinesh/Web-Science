   Are your Electric lawn Mowers environmentally safe?
   michealsmith

   When it comes to the week end nearly everyone around the world decide
   that they need to mow the lawn and in the US alone there are around 50
   million people mowing their lawn which means there is around 800
   million gallons of petrol per year being used just on electric lawn
   mowers which is a staggering figure.

   Just by using your mower for one hour it is equivalent to driving for
   350 miles as one petrol mower emits 87 pounds of greenhouse gasses and
   around 54 pounds of other toxic pollutants annually into the atmosphere
   and over 17 million gallons of gas is used in lawn mowers which believe
   it or not is more than the spillage of oil by the Valdez a year.

   The EPA stated that petrol powered lawn mowers produce the same amount
   of pollution as would 45 new cars each being driven for 12 000 miles.
   In addition to the contamination of ground water spilled fuel
   evaporates into the air and toxins are emitted which cause smog and in
   turn effects the ozone layer.

   Petrol mowers release hydrocarbons which not only cause smog but
   account for major damage to the respiratory system due to the carbon
   monoxide and carbon dioxide which also contributes to the global
   warming effects. Not only does this damage ones lungs but contributes
   towards cancerous tumors, heart disease and weakens the immune system.

   Smog is also known to inhibit plant growth and the EPA is now taking
   drastic measure to regulate mower emissions. Electric cordless and cord
   mowers save on gas spills and awareness programs are set in place
   making people more aware when choosing a lawn mower. The only lawn
   mower that does not emit any carbons is the push mowers.

   Ozone alert hours are prevalent during the summer months when ground
   ozone levels rise to unhealthy levels it increases as well as aggravate
   those suffering from asthma and allergies. The environmental agencies
   will then call an Ozone action day whereby no mowers may be used on
   that day.
