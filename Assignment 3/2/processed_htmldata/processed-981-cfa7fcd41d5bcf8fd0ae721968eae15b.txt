[28]How to Grow Bananas

   Many may think that bananas are actually trees. Actually, these are
   considered as perennial herbs that are abundantly grown in most
   tropical areas. Tropical areas? But what if you would like to grow
   bananas at home so you can reap the fruits of your labor? What are the
   things you need to know to learn how to grow bananas?

   Where to Get Your Baby Banana Tree?

   The first step that would get you started in learning how to grow
   bananas is to learn where to get them. You can do this easily on the
   Internet since most sites have catalogs for these things, and you
   simply click on your pick.

   You would see that there are offers on baby banana trees, banana
   rhizomes or suckers. It would be solely up to your preferences on what
   to start out with.

   If you do not really have any notion on learning how to grow bananas,
   it would be most appropriate to get yourself those baby banana trees
   that are planted already in pots or containers.

   Where Can Your Tree Grow?

   Choose a suitable location. Most of the pro gardeners would probably
   advice beginners to plant bananas in a place where there is ample sun
   exposure. Why? Because, typically, bananas need around twelve hours of
   sun exposure everyday to help it grow.

   The location should also be easy to protect from other harmful things
   like insects or birds.

   The type of soil is also important. You may need a light and
   well-drained soil for this.

   How to Take Care and Grow Your Tree?

   If you purchased a banana rhizome or sucker, you need to make a hole in
   the soil by digging about a foot for both its depth and its width in
   the soil. Then, plant your banana, and cover it with the surrounding
   soil or dirt.

   If you have a baby banana tree in a container, just plant it in the
   soil just like any plant placed in containers.

   It’s very important to keep the surrounding area of your banana free
   from weeds. Mulch the soil to help keep the weeds away.

   Before you water your banana, be sure to add fertilizer. You can water
   this whenever you notice the soil gets dry. But do not drown the soil
   and avoid having standing water around the tree.

   When your banana has grown to about 3/4ths in height, and you notice
   some banana suckers at the base, remove these immediately. But don’t
   remove them all. Leave one sucker to make it grow in the next few
   years.

   The time to reap may take some time. You will know when it is time to
   harvest when you notice that the bananas are plump and round, and also
   would not have ribs anymore. They will actually be green in color. But
   when you remove them from the tree, you will see that they will ripen
   on their own.

   You can choose to harvest them individually or by the bunch.

   After harvesting, it is pertinent to cut the tree down. That single
   sucker you left before will continue to grow and become a new tree that
   will give you more of those delicious bananas to enjoy.

   Another important point to bear in mind in learning how to grow bananas
   is that it takes about ten to fifteen months for the trees to have
   bananas. But after months of waiting, and if you had followed all the
   simple steps, you are sure to be happy with the produce that your plant
   will be able to give you at the end of a long wait.
