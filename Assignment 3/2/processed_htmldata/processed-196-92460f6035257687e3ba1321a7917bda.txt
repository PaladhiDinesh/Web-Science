   MONTREAL—The 50-year-old Montreal Metro is finally getting some new
   digs.

   The Bombardier Inc. and Alstom consortium tasked with manufacturing the
   next generation of Montreal subway cars has delivered the first vehicle
   for passenger testing. The new AZUR metro car sports larger doors, an
   eight per cent bump in passenger capacity, as well as better
   suspension—giving passengers on the iconic wheeled subway trains a
   smoother ride.

   “We are very proud to take part in introducing AZUR métro cars into
   service today,” Montreal’s mayor, Denis Coderre, said. “This historic
   event will have a major, positive impact on everyone using our
   well-established public transit network. Once again, Montréal is
   demonstrating that it is a world leader in sustainable mobility.”

   The first new train will enter service on the city’s Orange line, with
   crews monitoring its performance closely for the first two months. If
   all goes well following the initial testing phase, the Société de
   transport de Montréal (STM) plans to continue to roll out the new
   trains across its network for the next two years. The metro operator
   has ordered 51 trains comprised of 468 cars.

   The project is creating work at more than 150 Canadian suppliers, and
   each train contains more than 60 per cent Canadian content. The
   Bombardier-Alstom consortium is expected to continue delivering new
   vehicles until 2018.

   With Montreal subway passengers slated to get a smoother ride,
   Bombardier continues to navigate a bumpy road in Toronto, where transit
   riders are still waiting for the company to deliver a host of new
   streetcars. The Toronto Transit Commission said it would sue the
   Montreal-based company as a result of delivery delays last fall.
