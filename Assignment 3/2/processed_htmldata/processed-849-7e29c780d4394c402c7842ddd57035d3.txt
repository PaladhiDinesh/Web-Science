“Inspiration” and “Politicking” Right Here in Londonderry

   First of all you just can’t argue that we live in the very best State
   in the Country… New Hampshire!  I can feel it in the air and see it in
   our development that great things are just beginning and to come!  My
   dream for Londonderry and New Hampshire is that this is a place, state
   that our children want to stay in, raise their families in and always
   come back too… and that’s what’s happening now!  Londonderry and New
   Hampshire are becoming (and in many areas already are) an Inspiration
   to other Towns and States……How Great Is That!

   The “Inspiration” part of this weeks “On The Road With Sherry” happened
   just yesterday. . .  Tim Beaton who moved into Londonderry not long
   after me as it turns out, in the early 70’s, called to ask if there was
   some way he could register to vote.  Now that sounds easy to most of
   us, but Tim was stricken at a young age with Multiple Sclerosis.

   Yesterday I had the honor of meeting Tim at his home and registering
   him to “Vote” for the first time.  I asked Tim why “now” with wanting
   to Register?  Tim said that through the years life got in the way… to
   busy… meant too… all those things that we all say about so many
   things.  I asked if he had children and he said no… he shared with me
   that his wife died very young of Lung Cancer.  He lost her in just 4
   short months from the day she was diagnosed.  No warning, no big signs
   early on. Tim went on to explain to me that Donald Trump “Inspired” him
   to Register to Vote!  How Great is That! Tim loves his track record in
   business turning things around, his Passion, his energy, and that his
   top goal is to make America Great Again!

   Mr. Trump inspired Tim, but Tim Beaton inspired me!  I so enjoyed our
   time together and I know we will be seeing each other again!  Here Tim
   is in this tough situation that would break most of us and he was one
   of the happiest, most grateful people I have met in a long time.  We
   talked about the Candidates, Londonderry and even my girls.

   On the way to Tim’s house I pulled into a place that I didn’t even know
   existed in Londonderry the “Leslie C. Bockes Memorial Forest”.  Tim
   told me that there are trails back there and many people hike our great
   woods from this location.  It had a nice safe parking area right on
   Mills Road.   Tim asked me to remind everyone that this beautiful trail
   is right there.

   You have to “Google” this Trail.  I just stopped typing to you because
   I had to learn more… Tim really got me thinking about it and honestly I
   would have just driven right by!

   We have another “Gold Mine” right in Londonderry!” The Google Site for
   this trail is beautiful.  Here’s what I learned….It was started by
   Reverend Leslie C. Bockes and her family.  She initially started it as
   a summer camp for inner city youth from Lowell, Massachusetts.   Now it
   is known as a Tri-Town Forest being shared by Londonderry, Hudson, and
   Windham.  There are 226 acres waiting for us!  The trail that many
   people already enjoy is a 3.6 mile loop from the parking area.  There
   is a beautiful sign posted with information to get you “headed in the
   right direction” I guess you could say.

   The logging road is considered an easy trail and is great for Horse
   Back Riding, Hiking, Snow Shoeing and Skiing. Remember this is just one
   of the many trails available in these Tri-Towns.

   I can’t believe I had no idea about this!  Thank You Tim!

   Now back to the “Politicking” part… In our house right now the 4 of us
   are loving every minute of living in our Great State where there could
   not be a better place to be during all of this “Politicking”.  We
   haven’t decided yet who we are going to support, but we are doing our
   very best to watch the debates on TV, attend, listen, and read the
   information that is out there.  We are proud to be “Independent Voters”
   or as we need to put on the State Registering to Vote form….
   “Undeclared”.

   In New Hampshire we don’t have a formal Independent party.  Maybe it’s
   time that changed… We want the best person for the Huge Undertaking at
   Hand whether they are Republican or Democrat in every office.

   Honestly I like to see how hard they are willing to work, how
   personable they are, and yes their background is important but if they
   have backbone and great listening skills they will be smart enough to
   surround themselves with specialist in each of the vital areas.
   President Regan and President Kennedy would be great examples of this
   in my book anyway.

   Well a couple weeks back John and I were coming out of our new found
   Bagel Place I told you about in Nashua.  It was one of our very early,
   unshowered, hoping no one would see us drives to the farmers market…
   Again.  As we walked into the shop “Outside” was standing Mike
   Broderick who is running for the position of Mayor of Nashua.

   Mike was so personable, friendly and sincere that we wanted to stop and
   learn more about him.  What an impressive guy!  He simply loves
   Nashua!  He was in our National Guard, he raised his family there; he
   started and owns his own business in Nashua over 30 years ago.

   John and I were “Inspired” by him!  Standing out there on his day off,
   handing out flyers, taking a chance, putting yourself out there….
   Politics are not easy and we all know how nasty they can get.  His
   Flyer says “As your experienced and committed Mayor, I will work for
   you to insure a better quality of life for you and your families”.  To
   me part of that means he wants to keep our young people and families
   here, too!

   Mr. Broderick had a great handshake, looked you in the eye with
   sincerity… and if we could vote he would have our vote on September 8th
   in Nashua.  Vote Broderick!  I know you won’t be disappointed.

   With a Grateful Heart for the “Gifts” of Our Great State, Londonderry,
   Meeting Tim, for good men and woman who are willing to stand up for
   what they believe in with Grace Under Pressure and for all of
   you….especially “Wayne” and his gift of words.

   Happy Happy Birthday to Me “55” Today xoxoxoxo

Londonderry Comments

     * [262]Steve Homsey: Martin, As I believe the myth of Conservatism
       needs to be Abolished as well. Let’s spend 1 trillion on the New
       F-35 Strike fighter, Let’s spend 5 trillion on War. You know...
     * [263]Martin Srugis: Please spare us the lecture. As I thought the
       system is rigged on your side as well as ours. Point being, you are
       no better than I. Socialism needs to be opposed where ever...
     * [264]Steve Homsey: Typical GOP Response. If it doesn’t come from
       Rush’s behind it just cant be true, right? Here’s another: Donald
       Trump, AKA Mr. Pants on Fire! From Political fact...
     * [265]Martin Srugis: I checked into Fact Check, they don’t tell you
       who they are or were they get their money from. H’mmm?
     * [266]Steve Homsey: Ken, No, lies like WMD and wasting 5 Trillion
       Dollars! But can’t afford to fund Social Security, can’t afford to
       fund Healthcare, can’t afford any otherr social...
     * [267]Steve Homsey: Martin, You have days mixed up. The clown show
       was on Saturday!!! Here are some highlights:https://www.youtube
       .com/watch?v=wMyRoeNmEeY Only people who got it right were in the
       crowd,...
     * [268]Ken McLoon: You mean lies like “If you like your health care
       plan, you can keep your health care plan”? How many times did we
       hear that. Or how about “The average family will see...
     * [269]Steve Homsey: One hopes the same can be said for Trump
       supporters… As long as Republican’s are allowed to out and out
       right LIE to people, I am unsure if People are smart enough to
       make...
     * [270]Ken McLoon: We all know that Bernie Sanders support is mostly
       coming from young people. If Bernie wins the popular vote, and the
       delegates select Hillary, one of two things will happen. There
       will...
     * [271]Steve Homsey: Example (as Republican’s are the hardest to
       “school”, as their learning windows have been NAILED Shut!) Hillary
       and Bernie: Hillary beat Bernie in Iowa by .2%, 49.8...
     * [272]Gail manning: Great job. Sherry
     * [273]Steve Homsey: Martin, You do know the Republicans use Super
       Delegates right? I think they just call them Undecided or
       Uncommitted Delegates, but it’s the exact same thing. Either way,
       either...
     * [274]Steve Homsey: Hey, I know the negatives are going to fly. But,
       don’t shoot the messenger. I don’t make this stuff up you know:
       “When it comes to that whole truthiness thing,...
     * [275]Steve Homsey: Martin, I’ll tell you. I am sure it’s foreign to
       you, however, CBS did a piece on FACT CHECK sites this morning.
       Some 82 in all worldwide. They don’t come out and...
     * [276]Cole Ostemie: Hang these c_unts
     * [277]Martin Srugis: The clown show was on last night. Tell me, “why
       does the Progressives need super-delegates to their convention?
       Maybe you can explain it better than Wasserman tried to do.
     * [278]Steve Homsey: I Highly doubt it! Both Sanders and Trump are
       Running on Rhetoric. If anyone watched the debate on PBS yesterday
       they would have seen this. Like it or not we have to deal with...
     * [279]Frank Campisi: Just over 10,000 Londonderry residents went to
       the polls and 62% of them voted for a candidate on the Republican
       ballot. Donald Trump won the town with 37% which is slightly
       better...
     * [280]Martin Srugis: Of course there is, how do you think Vermin
       Supreme got seven votes?! The state needs to fix this drive-by
       voting. ID and proof you live in town and not a student. I’m glad
       you...
     * [281]Steve Homsey: So Martin, So all 6,100? BY the count listed
       here it totals 6,298. If I were not the person I am I WOULD BE
       SCREAMING VOTER FRAUD!!!!!! Me thinks the numbers posted here are
       not...
