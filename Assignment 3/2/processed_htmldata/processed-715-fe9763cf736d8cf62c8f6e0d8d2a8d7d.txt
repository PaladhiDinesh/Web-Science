   SANTA CLARA, Calif. (CBSNewYork/AP) — Cam Newton’s dream season ended
   with a nightmare performance.

   Fresh off being named the league’s MVP, the Panthers fifth-year
   quarterback was stymied by an aggressive Denver Broncos defense in his
   first Super Bowl appearance on Sunday.

   It didn’t get any better off the field, as Newton also walked out
   during his postgame interview.

   “I don’t know what you want me to say, I’m sorry,” a very dejected
   Newton said, prior to walking off.

   CBS Sports Radio’s Jim Rome took a shot at Newton following his
   postgame press conference.

   “Cam’s presser was weak. If you’re going to celebrate when you win,
   you’ve got to face the music when you lose,” Rome tweeted.

     Cam's presser was weak. If you're going to celebrate when you win,
     you've got to face the music when you lose.

     — Jim Rome (@jimrome) [102]February 8, 2016

   The 6-foot-5, 245-pound quarterback who scored 45 touchdowns during the
   regular season — and five more in the playoffs — failed to produce a TD
   running or throwing for the first time this season and the Panthers
   lost 24-10 in Super Bowl 50.

   Newton didn’t get much help from his offensive line which allowed a
   Super Bowl record-tying seven sacks, or his wide receivers, who dropped
   big passes at key times.

   Newton spent much of the game under heavy duress as the Panthers were
   unable to handle the pressure of Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware on the
   edges. Miller had 2 1/2 sacks, including two strip-sacks against
   overmatched right tackle Mike Remmers that led to Denver’s two
   touchdowns.

   Denver’s first touchdown came when Miller blew past Remmers and ripped
   the ball out of Newton’s grasp. Malik Jackson recovered the ball in the
   end zone for a touchdown to put the Panthers in an early 10-0 hole they
   could never dig out of.

   Newton never looked comfortable in the pocket, side-arming throws,
   overthrowing wide receivers and generally running for his life.

   Eventually frustration began to set it.

   With Carolina trailing by six late in the fourth quarter, Miller broke
   through again and knocked the ball from Newton’s hands. With the ball
   rolling on the turf, Newton opted not to dive in the pile and the
   Broncos recovered at the Panthers 4 to set up C.J. Anderson’s clinching
   TD run.

   With less than three minutes remaining, Newton was knocked down in the
   end zone and screamed at an official looking for a late hit but didn’t
   get one.

   The question surrounding the Panthers all year long was whether their
   wide receivers would be good enough for Newton after Kelvin Benjamin
   went down with a season-ending knee injury in training camp.

   Carolina still managed to finish No. 1 in the league in scoring this
   season, putting up 500 points in the regular season and 80 more in the
   postseason.

   But a key drop by Jerricho Cotchery early came two plays before
   Newton’s first fumble. Ted Ginn Jr. also had a ball go through his
   hands and into the awaiting arms of T.J. Ward for an interception that
   denied Carolina a scoring opportunity.

   The Broncos neutralized tight end Greg Olsen and the Panthers lost
   Philly Brown to a concussion in the second half rendering their offense
   useless.

   The Panthers could never establish a running game with Jonathan Stewart
   held to 29 yards on 12 carries and one touchdown run while battling
   through a foot injury.

   Newton finished with 265 yards passing and only a 55.4 quarterback
   rating.
