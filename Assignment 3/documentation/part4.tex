\label{part4}
\begin{verbatim}

4.  Compute the Kendall Tau_b score for both lists (use ``b'' because
there will likely be tie values in the rankings).  Report both the
Tau value and the ``p'' value.

\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Here I need to calculate the kendall Tau b value and p-value.
\item I used Tau b because there are tie values in the rankings.
\item Tau b  score is used to measure the association between the ranks produced by TFIDF and Page rank.
\item I have both the TFIDF and page rank values into two vectors and ``cor.text'' command is used in ``R''  giving method as ``Kendall'' which returns Tau b value and p-value.
\item Output :- tau = 0.7833, z= 2.8088, p-value = 0.0024
\item Here 3 URIs have 0 rank and 6 of them have 0.6 rank. So, there are a lot of ties and Kendall's tau coefficient shows a high correlation.
\end{enumerate}
