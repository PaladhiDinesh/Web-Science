\label{part2}
\begin{verbatim}
2.  Manually classify the first 50 entries, and then classify (using
the fisher classifier) the remaining 50 entries. 

Create a table with the title, predicted category, actual category,
and cprob() and fisherprob() for the actual category.


\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
\item In order to classify the feeds into the respective categories I need to train the data first.
\item So what I did first is to divide the data into two parts. First 50 feeds are for training the code and the next 50 are for getting automatic classifications based on training.
\item This is done with the help of docclass and feedfilter codes which are taken as a reference from Programming collective Intelligence textbook.
\item Later by using the code I figured out to get the cprob() and fisherprob() values for the feeds.
\item I have saved all those outputs and can be seen in the following tables below.
\item Sample output for the first 50 feeds can be seen in the fig\ref{Samplet1} and the sample output for the last 50 feeds can be seen in the fig\ref{Samplet2}/.
