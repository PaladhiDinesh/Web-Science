I tried to understand ``Friendship paradox'' from the source provided in the question.
It is the phenomenon which states that your friends on an average will have more friends than you.
Based on this phenomenon this question is phrased and the solution proves it.
As facebook has increased its privacy settings, we cannot scrap friends details now and so we got XML file from our professor which was previously saved in 2013.
Now this file should be processed and I need to get the number of friends my friends have and it compare it with my count of friends.
I used minidom to parse the graphml file and Tag name ``data'' was used to get all the data elements with this tag name.
Later with the help of key value from the data attributes I managed to get the ``Label'' and ``friend_count''. 
When I manually parsed through the file I discovered that some of them does not show up their friend_count.
So people with friend_count are only considered and all of them have been written into a csv file. Python code for this can be found in \ref{lst:q1-1}
One csv file consists of all the Labels of friends and their friends count but it does not ``Michael Dr.Nelson's'' friends count. This is shown in \ref{Sample list1}
Other csv file consists of the same data as in previous file but ``Dr.Michael Nelson's'' friend count is included here. This is shown in \ref{Sample list2}
The reason for creating to different files is that one with Dr.Nelson's count is used to plot graph and other one without Dr.Nelson's count is used to calculate mean,median and standard deviation.
Once I got these two files I wrote code in R to find out mean,median and standard deviation and they are shown in \ref{lst:q1R}.
A bar plot is also drawn which shows friends on x-axis and friends count for each friend on y-axis. This can been seen in \ref{graph1} and the code for it can be seen in \ref{2nd:q1R}
Friends count of Dr.Michael Nelson is indicated with a blue arrow mark in the graph so that we can visualize the friendship paradox here.
The Mean we calculated is 358.987 and the friends count of Dr.Michael Nelson is 154. Therefore friends count of Dr.Michael Nelson is less than the Mean which shows that Michael Nelson's friends have more friends than Michael Nelson. 
This proves Friendship Paradox using facebook friends list.

This question is about determining whether ``Friendship paradox'' holds for Twitter account. Here I took ``followers '' as a value of measure to prove the paradox.
In order to prove this I need to have the twitter data,so I started to write a python code \ref{lst:q2-1} to get data from twitter using twitter API. I choose the source account as my account(``dineshpaladhi'') because I have 52 followers.
From my previous assignments I got my Customer and Access tokens. I used tweepy library in order to get the follower's screen name and the number of followers they have.
Screen_name and followers_count gives us the required data and they are stored in two csv files.
First csv file can be found here \ref{Sample_t1} and it contains the followers screen name and their followers count along with my followers count.
Second csv file can be found here \ref{Sample_t2} and it does not contains my followers count.
Files are saved in this way so that it would be easy for me to plot graphs and calculate mean,mode and standard deviation separately.
R code for calculating mean,mode and standard deviation can be seen here \ref{lst:q2R}.
R code for bar plot can be seen here \ref{2nd:q2R} and my followers count is indicated with a blue arrow mark in the graph so that we can visually see friendship paradox.This can been seen in \ref{graph2}.
The Mean I calculated is 71.365 and the followers count of ``dineshpaladhi'' is 52. Therefore followers count of ``dineshpaladhi'' is less than the Mean which shows that ``dineshpaladhi's'' followers have more followers than ``dineshpaladhi''. 
This proves Friendship Paradox using Twitter's follower list.

This question is about determining whether ``Friendship paradox'' holds for LinkedIn account. Here I took ``connections '' as a value of measure to prove the paradox.
This is similar to the question 1 and the process of getting LinkedIn data is different and rest of all is the same.
Now in order to get LinkedIn data I planned to not use API as it wasted a lot of my time and I was unsuccessful.
So, I thought to scrape the data using command prompt and the command to get all my connections is shown in \ref{code_1}
The sample output for this is shown in \ref{Sample Connections}.
My plan was to strip unnecessary data from each of the my connection's link and take them into a csv file.
Later on I would run a for loop which takes each connection and get the number of connections they have and store in a file.
This gives me the required data and then the same graph,mean,median,mode can be calculated. 
I was unable to complete this solution.

This question is similar to the second question. There I used ``followers'' and here I need to use ``following''.
I choose the source account as my account(``dineshpaladhi'') because I have 186 people following me.
So, this should prove that ``people I am following following more people?''
To make it more understandable, here I used ``friends'' to represent ``following'' people .
Python code is same for this except for the api object we use. Earlier I used api.followers in order get followers and now I used api.friends in order to get the list of people I am following. Python code for this can be seen here \ref{lst:q3-1}.
First csv file can be found here \ref{Sample_t3} and it contains the friends screen name and their friends count along with my friends count.
Second csv file can be found here \ref{Sample_t4} and it does not contains my friends count.
R code for calculating mean,mode and standard deviation can be seen here \ref{lst:q3R}.
R code for bar plot can be seen here \ref{2nd:q3R} and my friends count is indicated with a blue arrow mark in the graph so that we can visually see friendship paradox.This can been seen in \ref{graph3}.
The Mean I calculated is 8292.253 and the following people count of ``dineshpaladhi'' is 186. Therefore following people count of ``dineshpaladhi'' is less than the Mean which shows that ``dineshpaladhi's'' friends have more friends than ``dineshpaladhi''. 
This proves Friendship Paradox using Twitter's following list.
