   Plus-size vlogger Shiann Friesen is fighting back after a Walmart
   employee urged her not to try on a sweater because she would "stretch
   it" too much.
   Friesen, 19, captured the incident [73]in a video, which she posted to
   her YouTube channel, [74]ShiCurves, on Jan. 26. In it, the Canadian
   vlogger [75]attempts to try on a sweater and other clothing in the
   dressing room, but the female Walmart employee takes the clothes away
   from Friesen.
   "Sorry, I'm really confused, what were you asking me not to do?"
   Friesen says.
   "Just don't try to push it," the woman tells her.
   "I don't understand," Friesen responds.
   "Just don't try to put on something that's obviously not going to fit.
   That's all I'm asking," the employee says. "Just don't stretch it.
   That's all I asking. I'm not trying to impertinent or anything."

   Friesen then turned off her camera out of fear that she would be asked
   to delete the footage, but says that she informed the employee that
   this was a [76]form of discrimination, and told the store manager about
   the incident.
   "I was so shocked I had to ask her to repeat what she had said, because
   maybe I would hear it differently," Friesen tells PEOPLE. "And of
   course, I didn't. But I quickly recognized that I was [77]being
   discriminated against, and I was hurt. I felt anger, and vulnerability;
   something I never would have expected to happen to me. It brought out
   flashes of stories I've heard on the news, now only it wasn't some
   stranger being discriminated, it was me."
   Friesen says in the video that she's since reached out to Walmart, and
   they've been very apologetic. She plans on sending her video footage
   and a statement to the company.
   "Every single person from the Walmart team I talked to has been
   extremely sorry and extremely shocked that this even happened at one of
   their stores," Friesen says.
   PEOPLE reached out to Walmart Canada to comment on the incident, who
   added that they had just become aware of it and were working on
   reaching Friesen.
   "The only thing we know of at this point is the video," Alex Roberton,
   senior director of corporate affairs, tells PEOPLE. "But there's no
   record of her reaching out to the store or to head office at this
   point."
   After PEOPLE informed them that Friesen says she's been in contact with
   Walmart corporate, he added, "One of our core beliefs is respect for
   the individual, that's certainly paramount. So obviously whoever she
   talked to [at Walmart corporate] is reacting appropriately. I just
   don’t have a record of those conversations here. We'll continue our
   efforts [to reach Friesen] on our end."
   Roberton was unable to speak to any plans to fire the Walmart employee.
   "We wouldn't discuss that publicly," he explains.

Would You Do That to a 14-Year-Old?'

   The [78]entire incident was eye-opening for Friesen.
   "People have had their opinions on what I should put on my body, but
   never have I been denied the right to try on an item," Friesen tells
   PEOPLE. "I've never experienced discrimination against my size, first
   hand."
   "I felt vulnerable and almost like I was 'naked in a crowd,' so to
   speak," Friesen says. "But, ultimately it made me stronger. It gave me
   the fuel I needed to stand up against situations like this, and be that
   voice. Would I want it to happen all over again, no, but I can say it's
   defiantly given me a different perspective."
   Now she hopes that publicizing her experience will stop [79]anything
   like it from happening again.
   "I think discrimination can happen to anyone, thick or thin," Friesen
   says. "That's another reason I made this public, because people need to
   be educated that discrimination can happen to anyone. Since making my
   story public on my YouTube channel, I have had viewers come forward
   with times they've been discriminated against and some of those stories
   are from being 'too thin.' "
   "I am hoping this gives people the confidence to stand up to injustice
   and discrimination. It is my mission to teach people they have worth,
   and need to pride themselves enough to stand up and speak out about
   injustices in the world, that is my duty as a human."
