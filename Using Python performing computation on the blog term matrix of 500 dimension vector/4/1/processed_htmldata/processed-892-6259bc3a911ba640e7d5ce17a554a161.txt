   McDonald's Kale Salad

   When future historians ponder the [35]Great Kale Shortage of 2016,
   they'll note the decision by Ronald McDonald, the formerly trendsetting
   culinary icon, to put the leafy green crucifer onto [36]the menu at the
   1,400 Canadian locations of his eponymous eatery. Kale, once found
   primarily in green smoothies, artisanal chips, and paving the streets
   of Brooklyn, has been fully democratized.

   Inevitably, much of the resulting discussion has focused on health.
   When you try to turn a salad into a full meal, no matter how healthy,
   calories do happen. Still, the "Keep Calm, Caesar On" and "I'm
   Greek-ing Out" salads are notable for their robustness: with 730
   calories, 53 grams of fat, and 1,400 mg of sodium, the Caesar option
   [37]easily outstrips even a Double Big Mac.

   But this well-intentioned chatter misses a question of much greater
   importance to devoted gastronomes: Is it any good?

   My meal got off to an inauspicious start when my server informed me,
   with a sympathetic cluck, that they didn't have the grilled chicken
   option on the premises that day. Leaving aside my suspicion that the
   option was only available on days not ending in "y," I settled for the
   "crispy chicken" alternative, an elongated relative of the McNugget. My
   friend Andrew opted for the same, and the brown paper bag, as we
   carried it through an undulating crowd of teens from the local high
   school on lunch break, had a satisfying heft.

   [ce7c68d3c9e87fc4f39a7bb8f9d4c5d9.jpg]
   Yes, that's one tiny piece of kale.

   I'd enlisted Andrew to join me for two reasons. Starting in the late
   1980s, we spent our high-school years dashing out to McDonald's once a
   week for a special treat. Our friendship was formed over Big Macs with
   the pickles removed and those tiny bags of French fries they used to
   serve. Now Andrew is something of a foodie who has his own sous-vide
   machine at home and more or less knows how to use it. He also enjoys a
   well-made kale salad.

   The salads were playfully plated in a way to evoke instant curiosity.
   Where, we wondered, was the kale that everyone was talking about? Some
   modest excavation revealed small, teardrop-shaped leaves of baby kale
   salted into the romaine-heavy mix.

   On its own, the kale had an exceptionally mild, almost iceberg flavor,
   suggesting that McDonald's has found a cultivar that will appeal to the
   broadest swath of the nation’s palate. In addition to the kale and
   romaine, there was also one small purple leaf of unclear provenance;
   later research suggested it was probably the "premium lettuce mix,"
   theoretically consisting of "Lolla Rosa lettuce, red leaf lettuce,
   tango lettuce, green leaf lettuce, and green oak lettuce." Andrew, to
   his disappointment, didn’t get one.

   Developing World)

   Kale is only part of the story of this salad — a minor part. In
   addition to the chicken, there were generous portions of bacon and
   Parmesan cheese, as well as pouches of roasted garlic focaccia croutons
   and a creamy Asiago Caesar dressing. These constituents mingled
   together in a plastic-fork-bending crescendo of saltiness that
   counterbalanced the crisp freshness of the greens.

   "It's actually pretty good," Andrew noted after a few bites.

   It's tempting to see, in the audacity and innovation of the recipe, the
   influence of the frontier spirit at the far-flung edges of the
   McDonald's empire. The Canadian market, after all, was where the
   chain’s daring experiments with pizza made the most headway in the
   1990s. One wonders also whether the hint of sweetness in the dressing
   is a nod to the northern predilection for maple syrup (though this
   effect is, in fact, cleverly executed with plain old sugar).

   But could the kale salad play in Peoria? By the time I scraped clean
   the bottom of my cardboard bowl, I was wishing I'd ordered two cups of
   water, but I wasn’t hungry. Also absent was that feeling of
   self-loathing that follows a particularly regrettable meal. I felt like
   I'd eaten food — and, under the circumstances, I'd call that a victory
   for the onward march of kale.
