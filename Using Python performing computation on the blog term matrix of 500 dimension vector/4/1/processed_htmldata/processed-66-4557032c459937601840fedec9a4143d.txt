   The New York City subway is not an especially prudish place. In
   addition to the unflappable readers of romance novels, there are the
   advertisements, which specialize in double entendre. A mattress company
   entices riders by promising a comfortable place to “go too far.” A
   plastic surgeon’s office illustrates breast enhancement with
   clementines transformed into grapefruits. But [55]last fall, when a
   young company called [56]Thinx that makes “period underwear” —
   constructed of special fabric to ensure menstrual blood doesn’t leak or
   stain — submitted a proposal for ads that employed grapefruit halves
   (and runny eggs) in an if-Georgia O’Keeffe-painted-food kind of way,
   the media company that evaluates ads for the [57]MTA balked. You may
   have heard about this, because it was big news on the internet: “Will
   the New York City Subway Ban These Ads for Using the Word ‘Period’?”
   [58]asked Mic, in a post that was widely aggregated and shared with
   righteous anger on Facebook and Twitter. (“Yes @mta, let’s not suggest
   that women get periods” and “DEAR NY SUBWAY, THERE WILL BE BLOOD.”) The
   MTA told the [59]Times that this wasn’t at all the case, that the ads
   were still in the review process, and that “of course” they would run.
   “We were hoping to work with the advertiser to refine the copy,” said a
   spokesperson. But the ins-and-outs of the bureaucratic approval process
   were really beside the point, because Thinx had experienced what its
   founder Miki Agrawal said was the third of its five viral moments to
   date — and in the process had increased its revenue by a factor of 23.

   As any casual observer of the Donald Trump campaign can tell you,
   internet outrage is the fastest route to “earned media” — free
   publicity — and this is something Agrawal understands intuitively.
   “Literally, my director of marketing called me sobbing after we spent a
   month busting our asses working on these ads,” she told me, a month
   later, scraping soy yogurt from a bowl, perched at her kitchen table in
   front of a Mac laptop with a prominent Burning Man decal on it. “I was
   like, sweetheart, I got this.” Agrawal’s apartment is a lofted condo
   inside an old Catholic church, strewn with succulents and yoga
   accoutrements. A surfboard sat on a sunny balcony. I’d walked there
   from the Bedford Avenue L stop, which was by then entirely covered in
   the grapefruit Thinx ads. Agrawal, who has large brown eyes framed by
   bangs and the sort of asymmetrical shaved sideburn Skrillex made
   famous, was wrapped in a plaid blanket over her black crop top and
   artfully torn leggings. She spoke quickly, intensely, and with her
   hands. “The good news about the way this world is today is that if
   there is a good fight to be fought, there are people who will listen to
   you and write about it. Subject heading: ‘SCANDAL with the MTA’?” Her
   eyes got wider. “It’s like, Ooh, I’m going to open that email. You know
   what I mean?”

   If Agrawal were a man, her type would be immediately recognizable: She
   meditates with the app Headspace, she does Crossfit, she has given a
   [60]TEDx talk, she quotes Steve Jobs and Tim Ferriss. She is
   self-mythologizing, utterly confident even in situations where she has
   no good reason to be, and it all serves her exceedingly well. She is a
   tech bro — except she’s a woman, trying to sell underwear. Or, as she
   sees it, innovating in the “period space.”

   Agrawal says she came up with the idea for Thinx ten years ago, when
   she and her identical twin sister, Radha, were running a three-legged
   race at their annual family reunion, Agrapalooza, and Radha’s period
   started, so the twins had to three-leg their way to the bathroom for
   damage control. (Though not until after they’d won, “which is my
   favorite thing about it.”) “As she was washing the blood out of her
   bathing-suit bottom, that was the aha moment,” Agrawal explained. “We
   were like, what if we could make a pair of underwear that never leaked,
   that never stained, that absorbed blood?” Five years later, Agrawal was
   on vacation in South Africa, where she met a young girl on the street
   who was missing school because she had her period. She  then learned a
   [61]statistic that helped her see a way to elevate her business idea
   into a cause: One in ten African girls miss school every month because
   of their periods. This was, she said, another aha moment. “I came back
   super-jacked” and decided to pursue something a little like the Toms
   Shoes model: For every pair of Thinx that’s sold, the company will
   donate toward the cost of one set of reusable pads for a Ugandan girl,
   via a company called [62]Afripads that was started by “a beautiful
   Canadian couple who were traveling in Uganda, discovered this problem,
   and wound up staying.” Reusable pads like Afripads “do exist in
   America, but they’re, like, the most uncomfortable,” Agrawal explained.
   “You’re like, why do I have fleece in my crotch right now? This is,
   like, a joke. But for people who literally have nothing, it’s a dream
   come true. For us, we’re like, I just want to wear underwear and bleed
   in my underwear. You know what I mean?” She laughed.

   I didn’t, actually, having spent the past 18 years trying to avoid
   exactly that scenario, but Agrawal wanted me to try a pair, especially
   when she found out the timing of my visit was felicitous. “This is
   happening right now,” she said with delight. “You’re going to take your
   tampon out, and you’re going to put this underwear on.”

   Agrawal ripped open a cardboard box and pulled out a pair of Thinx’s
   new boy-short line — meant to be [63]transmasculine-friendly, an
   innovation that led to the company’s fifth viral bump — and dispatched
   me to the bathroom, where a pair of her own just-washed Thinx were
   dripping into the tub. The underwear, which costs between $24 and $38,
   comes in a range of styles, including lace, and absorbencies, including
   a thong for light days and a brief that can absorb two tampons’ worth
   for heavy days. The technology behind it is a little murky — Thinx’s
   patent filing refers to layers of fabric, including a
   “moisture-impermeable polymer layer,” a “moisture-absorbent layer,” and
   a "moisture-wicking layer" — but the promise of the garment is that, if
   used as a backup, waiting too long to change a tampon will never result
   in a spoiled pair of underwear. Or they can enable a more radical
   “free-bleeding” approach, for those who, like Agrawal, are suspicious
   of Big Tampon. “What kind of tampon are you wearing? Did you not read
   the article that just came out about them causing cancer? You need to
   be wearing organic cotton tampons if anything,” Agrawal said. “Which,
   by the way, we’re introducing. Just friend to friend, don’t wear that
   regular shit! You have no idea! Toxic shock syndrome starts after three
   hours, and there are so many cases that get, like, pushed under the rug
   by tampon companies.” (The FDA does not consider either Toxic Shock
   Syndrome or cancer a serious risk of using tampons, and while it's true
   that there are [64]no studies of long-term tampon use, there's
   also [65]no medical data suggesting women should use organic products
   instead.)

   Agrawal frequently speaks in data-driven, consciousness-raising sound
   bites — many of which, upon closer inspection, turn out to be
   exaggerations, the kind of apocryphal stats that get repeated by
   celebrities and recirculated on blogs. “Twenty billion plastic
   applicators end up in a landfill every year,” she says, though
   technically that number also includes pads. (Thinx is also, as it
   happens, introducing silicone applicators that women can carry in their
   purses that look like a stylish lipstick and are supposed to last up to
   a decade.) There’s lots more that worries and enrages her: “The average
   American goes through 57 sheets of toilet paper a day.” And! “There are
   500,000 women in America that are victims of female genital
   mutilation.” (That’s the number who are at risk.) Plus! “There are a
   million women who are sold in the sex trade in America.” (It’s
   difficult to quantify this one, but …) And! “95 percent of women in
   porn are victims of abuse and sexual abuse,” a friend who works in the
   industry told her. And! Plus! “My sister is a surgeon at Hopkins and
   was given 20 percent less than her male counterparts, and she graduated
   top of her class at Harvard, Yale, and Hopkins. You know what I mean?
   And this is happening RIGHT now.”

   But Agrawal, like many in the tech and business worlds, believes that
   all this overwhelming awfulness can be gradually fixed — without
   sacrificing profit. “I would not be able to be super-jacked about a
   product that’s just a product,” she explained. “I need to feel like
   there’s a great cause.” But on the other hand: “If you just do good,
   you’re a nonprofit. And they are just shit, the way they’re designed,
   the way they’re marketed. You have to have a level of motivation to
   make a big dent in the universe.”

   Canny marketing is what Agrawal sees as central to her company’s
   success. The traditional way that “feminine hygiene” products have been
   marketed is as sanitized as the name of the category itself. Ads for
   pads and tampons use a blue fluid as an improbable stand-in for blood
   and employ images of women frolicking in fields of daisies or swimming
   in white bathing suits: happy, tidy menstruators. But in recent years,
   young women especially have taken pride in not shying away from talking
   about the gorier aspects of their monthly uterine exodus. [66]BuzzFeed
   ran a popular, memorable quiz called “How Metal Is Your Period?” (“Have
   you ever needed to use two tampons?” and 104 other such questions.) A
   [67]woman ran the London Marathon last year while free-bleeding, blood
   visibly staining her bright-orange leggings as she traversed 26 miles.
   “I thought, if there’s one person society won’t f*** with, it’s a
   marathon runner,” she [68]wrote on her personal blog. “If there’s one
   way to transcend oppression, it’s to run a marathon in whatever way you
   want.” Her story went viral, crystalizing a new online movement: period
   feminism, in which frankly confronting the world with the biological
   realities of being a woman has become a cause — sometimes a slightly
   ironic one, sometimes a completely earnest one. The idea, in a
   reductive nutshell, is that menstruation is a wholly natural part of
   life for anyone born a woman, and feeling obligated to hide the smells
   and the stains and the cramps is as symptomatic of the patriarchy as
   unequal pay and sexual harassment. And there’s a little fun to be had
   in the shock value of it, too: the modern day equivalent of bra
   burning.

   Thinx is unapologetically riding this tide of period feminism, to great
   success. The company sends out a weekly [69]newsletter called “This
   Week in Feminism,” with subject lines like “On Thursdays We Wear
   Feminism” (a reference to a line from the movie Mean Girls), and
   “Season’s Bleedings” and “Fa-la-la-la-la-la-va-gi-na,” for the
   holidays. Interspersed with hashtags like #periodproud, there are links
   to stories about voting rights for women in Saudi Arabia and sexual
   assault in the United States and updates on anti-abortion legislation,
   on Emma Watson’s [70]feminist book club, and on the State of the Union.
   (“Who else remembers Shania’s hit single “Man! I Feel Like A Woman
   (Because I Am Being Ignored Again)”???) There are inspirational lines
   like “When life hands you lemons, you squeeze them into the eyes of the
   patriarchy.”

   “I only started relating to being a feminist, literally, right when I
   started my company,” Agrawal told me. “Every time I thought about the
   word feminist, I thought about an angry, ranty … girl. When you hear
   those spoken-word poets and feminists, who are just like” — she made a
   high-pitched version of the Charlie Brown grown-up wah wah white-noise
   sound — “I just couldn’t relate to that. I was always on the ‘women are
   equal’ front and into empowerment and laughter and inspiration,” she
   continued. “But I learned so much in the past few years about the
   plight of women … What I tell my team every day is that we have to be
   accessible. We have to build a bridge to redefining what feminism is,
   and we have to do it in a way that makes your mouth go like this,” she
   said, forming her mouth into what she termed a “smirk.”

   Last fall, Agrawal and two other Thinx employees visited Gloria Steinem
   to talk about period feminism. Steinem had printed out a copy of the
   [71]fourth Thinx newsletter — which included stories on John Oliver’s
   feminism and the pros and cons of decriminalizing sex work — for
   discussion. Agrawal said she loves Steinem’s sense of humor, especially
   as it was on display in her classic 1978 Ms. magazine essay “If Men
   Could Menstruate.” “We helped her rewrite the piece with all current
   references, because before she was referencing dead people who are now
   dead,” says Agrawal. (A fictional Paul Newman’s Tampons was replaced
   with Channing Tatum’s Tampons; Muhammad Ali was updated to Tom Brady.)
   Sitting on Gloria Steinem’s couch was srsly the epitome of
   fempowering,” reported the next edition of the newsletter.

   At 37, Agrawal is a veteran “serial social entrepreneur,” as she likes
   to put it. In addition to Thinx, she is a partner in her twin sister’s
   company Super Sprowtz, which involves puppets teaching kids about
   nutrition, and helps out with Daybreaker, a monthly morning “rave” that
   Radha started. (The parties begin at 6 a.m., are completely sober, and
   often include a yoga class.) Agrawal grew up in Montreal, with a father
   who’d immigrated from India and a mother from Japan. Shortly after
   graduating from Cornell, where she and her twin were both soccer stars,
   she began working as an analyst for Deutsche Bank, next to the World
   Trade Center. On September 11, she woke up very late, only to discover
   that a terrible hangover had possibly saved her life, she says. Two of
   her colleagues died that morning, she says, and that led her to the
   very first of those aha moments: Why waste time not living your real
   dreams? At first, this meant trying out for a semiprofessional women’s
   soccer team, the New York Magic. Then, after she blew out both of her
   ACLs in subsequent seasons, it meant quitting her job to try writing
   screenplays and working as a freelance film and TV producer. But then,
   after diagnosing herself as lactose-intolerant following a particularly
   painful experience with craft services, Agrawal had the idea to start
   an organic, vegan pizza place. She had no experience, or capital, but
   she did have a tenuous connection to Richard Wolf, an owner of Tao (her
   sister’s boyfriend’s sister was friends with his wife). She needed to
   turn that tenuous connection into a real connection, so she planned a
   supposedly serendipitous run-in where she told Wolf she was “proud” of
   him for his success. This is standard operating procedure according to
   her 2013 [72]self-help-autobiography, Do Cool Sh*t: Quit Your Day Job,
   Start Your Own Business, and Live Happily Ever After, a book full of
   exclamation points, acronyms, action items for self-actualization, and
   a cover blurb that begins “Miki Agrawal is a real piece of work.” She
   writes, “I often find myself saying things like, ‘I’m proud of you.’ It
   implies familial bond, like a proud parent.” She offered Wolf an “MB” —
   a mutually beneficial experience — in which she would follow him around
   during the run-up to the opening of his new Lower East Side restaurant,
   to learn the nuts and bolts of running such a spot, and he would get
   free assistance. “I think he probably felt a bit on the spot with his
   wife and friends right there watching, but regardless, he agreed! Yes!
   I was so excited!” she writes in Do Cool Sh*t.

   Agrawal networked her way into a series of meetings with small-scale
   investors, borrowed a boardroom from a friend who worked at MTV, and
   cold-emailed a Food Network producer, successfully offering herself as
   the subject of a “Recipe for Success” episode by promising, she wrote,
   “that this show will be the train-wreck show that they’ve been waiting
   for. Reality TV is all about chaos, and I would give them chaos on a
   silver pizza tray.”

   As promised, the opening of Agrawal’s new restaurant, [73]Slice, was a
   disaster. In her excitement, Agrawal had ignored Wolf’s advice to
   soft-open the restaurant and had instead spent the weeks in the run-up
   to the launch hand-delivering press kits to every media outlet in town,
   including Daily Candy and the New York Times, which ran prominent
   coverage that sent an overwhelming tide of customers to the new
   restaurant — one of the first places in New York to offer gluten-free
   crust — to eat pizza that was, by her own admission, not good. The
   reviews weren’t kind. So Agrawal hand-delivered 5,000 letters of
   apology to residents of the neighborhood. Once she got the recipe
   worked out, she began going to playgrounds and giving free pizza to
   mothers; she became a spin instructor so that gym managers would let
   her set up a table where she could hand out Slice samples. “A lot of
   people have a lot of pride. I just didn’t give a shit,” said Agrawal.
   Eventually, she hired someone to manage operations and rebranded the
   restaurant as [74]Wild. It worked — the restaurant now has two
   locations, in Williamsburg and the West Village — although Agrawal said
   the whole experience helped her realize that logistics weren’t her
   strength: “I am a creative.”

   As the pizza restaurant became a grind, Agrawal was ready for the next
   idea. In 2009, she tried creating fresh, organic, make-your-own-pizza
   kits, but after about a year she pulled the plug. It’s not something
   Agrawal highlights on her résumé, but neither is she embarrassed about
   it. After all, failure is almost a rite of passage in the tech world,
   and that’s how Agrawal thought of herself when she started formulating
   her plans for period underwear. When I wondered if the name Thinx was
   perhaps an attempt to call to mind Spanx, Agrawal told me no.
   “Originally we were calling it Prance, which was … we don’t want to be
   a fashion brand, we want to be a utility brand,” she said: “the Goretex
   for underwear.” Plus, she added, it’s smart underwear—“underwear that
   thinks about you, underwear that thinks for you and thinks about girls
   around the world.” The “x just feels very tech.” In 2010, she began
   working on the new project in earnest, and the following year, trying
   to make connections she might parlay into investments, she signed up
   for Summit at Sea, an invite-only cruise in which young entrepreneurs
   pay a few thousand for the privilege of mingling with one another and
   dancing to house band the Roots. The year she went, the big names
   included web-entrepreneurial guru Gary Vaynerchuk, Richard Branson, and
   Zappos’s Tony Hsieh — the last of whom Agrawal zeroed in on. She parked
   herself across the bar from him one night and stared until she caught
   his eye, then waved until he smiled. “And that was it,” she wrote in Do
   Cool Sh*t. “It didn’t matter that he didn’t remember me at all. I had
   the smile, which meant I had the in!” She didn’t ruin the moment by
   talking to him — instead, she sent him an email after the cruise
   pretending they’d actually met and inviting him to lunch to talk about
   Thinx. To Agrawal’s surprise, when they met up, Hseih instead said he
   wanted to invest in her restaurant, which could open a new location in
   Las Vegas, where he was trying to engineer a thriving downtown
   district. (Wild Las Vegas has since closed, and Agrawal sold half her
   stake in the two New York locations.) Jonathan Swerdlin, who is
   chairman of the Thinx board — “I’m a man, but I’m also a feminist” —
   said that it’s obvious Agrawal’s charm is part of what’s propelled her
   forward: “There are very few people who can be as present as she is in
   conversations,” he said. “A large part of her success is meeting a lot
   of new people and a lot of the right people.”

   Hseih wasn’t the only meaningful connection Agrawal made on the Summit
   at Sea cruise — later that year she decided to go to Burning Man with a
   pal she’d met at Summit at Sea. By day three on the Playa, she and
   Andrew Horn had decided to get “Burning Man married” by the Reverend
   FunkPocket on the Pier to Nowhere, overlooking sand with the piped-in
   sounds of waves. Agrawal wore an impromptu sari she’d fashioned out of
   cloth from Walmart. “It was this trust fall,” said Horn, of their
   headlong romance. Horn and Agrawal renewed their vows at the next
   year’s Burning Man, proceeded by what Horn called his alternative
   bachelor party: “We had these very vulnerable conversations about our
   fears. It was very powerful.”

   They plan to get properly married sometime soon, for their parents.
   (Horn has a startup of his own, Tribute, to help people put together
   video compilations, meant to be “the Hallmark of the digital age.”) She
   chalks up their success together to factors described in an acronym
   Horn developed even before they met to measure what he wanted in a
   partner: LACE, meaning Looks, Adventure, Challenge, Enhance.

   When Agrawal was trying to raise funding for Thinx (most of which ended
   up coming from the Sri Lankan company that manufactures the underwear,
   along with products for Spanx, Victoria’s Secret, and Nike; her COO is
   the daughter of the factory’s owners), she didn’t talk about feminism —
   because most investors are men. Instead, she talked about data. I asked
   her to give me the man pitch, and she rattled off that feminine hygiene
   is a $20 billion category that women use for the better part of their
   lives and that there have been only three major innovations in the past
   hundred years: the invention of the commercial tampon in 1933 (“By a
   man!”), the addition of the adhesive strip underneath pads in 1969, and
   the menstrual cup in the 1980s. That there are more than 20 million
   millennial women in this country, and that at least 10 percent of them
   — educated, relatively affluent urban dwellers — would be intrigued by
   the design focus and “yas, queen”–filled messaging that Thinx intended
   to offer. “I also had one guy put a pad on and walk around,” said
   Agrawal. “I said, put it underneath your balls. He was like, ‘Oh my
   God,’ and I was like, ‘YEAH, that’s what we have to deal with.’” Thinx
   also created a 13-minute documentary in which Agrawal lays out the
   company’s mission while wearing three different hats, a dream-catcher
   necklace, and a feather in her hair. (From Do Cool Sh*t: “Step 1: Wear
   a cool, eyecatching outfit.”) In the film, she heads to Uganda to meet
   with girls using the Afripads that Thinx provides, pulls up Leviticus
   on her smartphone and reads the passage that refers to women being
   unclean, explains that the linguistic origins of the word taboo are
   related to the Polynesian word for menstruation, and asks friends like
   CW star Sophia Bush and Rabbi Debbie Newman to talk about their
   periods. (“Periods are dope,” says one.)

   “We get a new phone every single year, but you’re telling me that 50
   years have gone by since there’s been a new innovation in periods?”
   demands Agrawal in her doc. But it’s not entirely true that no one else
   has tried to “disrupt” periods recently. Patents exist for a “[75]cell
   phone based tampon monitoring system,” a vibrating tampon (to,
   supposedly, aid cramps), and a combination pad-tampon — kind of like a
   spork for your vagina. There are a few other companies currently
   offering period underwear — [76]Dear Kate, [77]Lunapads, and
   [78]PantyProp — but none has acquired the brand recognition of Thinx. I
   mentioned that I was working on this story to a few friends, women in
   their late 20s and early 30s who fit precisely the demographic Agrawal
   sees as her target, and they all had heard of them. “They serve me a
   ton of Facebook ads,” said one. Along with these, there have been
   copious Instagram ads, YouTube vlogger outreach, and a spate of excited
   coverage in places like Forbes, BuzzFeed, and the small but beloved
   Toast. ([79]Sample headline: “In Which I Freely Endorse THINX Period
   Underwear.”) My friends were curious: How do you wash them? Rinse by
   hand, they were dismayed to learn, before using a cold-cycle wash. What
   had it felt like to wear them rather than a tampon on a heavier day? A
   not dissimilar sensation, in some ways, to wearing a pad; I wound up
   reverting to my usual tampon. One friend of mine who has especially
   torrential periods and can bleed through a tampon in the course of her
   commute to work declared it a “billion-dollar idea” to use them as
   backup. I said that I’d found them most potentially useful at the
   barely there tail end of my period, and another friend shrugged: “I
   just don’t wear anything those days. I wear old underwear.” Or just
   black underwear, as lots of other women do — but don’t often talk
   about. That gets at the paradox of period panties: Thinx’s marketing
   tells women that they shouldn’t feel shame about menstruation, but to
   some degree actually selling the product to them rests on there being a
   deep reservoir of it. It's about keeping things clean, containing the
   mess, avoiding embarrassment.

   Agrawal and I headed to the Sweetgreen a few blocks from her apartment.
   After complimenting the salad-maker’s tattoo, Agrawal asked her for a
   single tortilla chip to munch on while her salad was made. She is, in
   addition to being gluten-free, dairy-free and sugar-free. When we met,
   she was a recent convert to veganism (she’s since dropped it), an
   experiment she’d been trying ever since she had become friends with
   John Mackey, the Whole Foods founder and a vegan activist. She and her
   sister had met him this fall at a CEO summit where Agrawal had given a
   talk about Thinx “in front of the most epic CEOs EVER.” Mackey and his
   business partner had given their talk about the recent difficulties of
   Whole Foods’ first-ever round of layoffs. “I was crying,” said Agrawal.
   “It’s a $14 billion company, and here are these two beautiful human
   beings who are just pouring their hearts out onstage.” She and Radha
   “just bum-rushed them and were like, ‘We want to help you guys bring
   Whole Foods to the next level and make it more relevant to
   millennials.’” The Agrawals arranged to have dinner with them that
   evening and used the intervening hour to prepare a 40-page deck of
   ideas — creating imaginary characters, like Whole Foods shopper Jackie,
   from Portland, Oregon, an avatar of locavorism with whom shoppers could
   identify; sprucing up the tone of their ads and social media to be
   “cheeky, clever, confident, energetic, perky, irreverent — because
   their voice was fucking boring”; telling the stories of a handful of
   urban farmers. “We don’t want to be Trader Joe’s. We’re cooler than
   them,” said Agrawal. “Their food just blows.” Mackey invited them to
   spend a few days at his house and later recommended the sisters be
   hired as consultants. When I asked Agrawal to put me in touch with a
   few people, she signed the emails to both her sister and Mackey the
   same way: “LOVE YOU!!! Xoxo.”

   This is poised to be a big year for Thinx: The organic tampons will
   roll out by the summer, as will the silicone applicators. While Agrawal
   won’t share specific sales figures (Thinx is a private company), she
   says it has sold “hundreds of thousands of pairs” of period panties
   “for multiple millions of dollars.” The staff has grown from five
   employees to 30 in the past six months. She hopes there will soon be
   ads in L.A., Portland, and Seattle. In New York, the ads are blanketing
   Grand Central and the Broadway-Lafayette subway station; in February,
   one out of every ten New York City subway cars will contain a Thinx ad.
   “Now the MTA is literally green-lighting everything,” says Agrawal. “We
   have a relationship that is awesome, and they’ve given us carte
   blanche.” The newest copy is less coy than the grapefruit version:
   “Thinx is a security blanket for your vadge,” reads one ad.

   Agrawal has also begun to think more about how to market Icon, the
   company’s new underwear line for new mothers who are experiencing bouts
   of incontinence. (Tagline: “For women who tinkle.”) A portion of each
   Icon sale goes to help fight the obstetric-fistula crisis — bladders
   torn during childbirth are often not repaired in certain parts of the
   world, and that can be deadly.

   And of course Agrawal has a “side hustle,” as she calls it: bidets. For
   [80]Tushy (tagline: “For people who poop”), she’s partnering with
   Charity: Water to work on sanitation in Africa. This time around,
   environmentalism (toilet-paper overuse) and general health (Agrawal
   mentioned hemorrhoids) will be the animating causes. “I’m realllly
   passionate about it, because when people take a shit it’s literally
   like wiping shit around. GBS: People have straight-up gross-butt
   syndrome,” she said. “Periods, pee, and poop. I’m not going to do a
   business unless I feel like I’m approaching a taboo head on anymore. I
   just love the taboo space.” (She is personally impatient with taboos,
   too: While on a call with a fact checker from New York, Agrawal
   switched over to speakerphone and audibly urinated, then flushed.)

   There are currently two models of Tushy available, both for under $100:
   white and silver, and a shiny black with gold trim, “so you sit on the
   throne.” Agrawal is confident she can get people to buy the Tushy, that
   she will be able to spin shit into gold. “It’s a brand play,” she told
   me, simple as that.
