   Four Republican presidential candidates are in a fierce battle — for
   second place in New Hampshire, according to a new poll.

   Donald Trump is crushing the field by grabbing 34 percent of the vote
   in the nation’s first presidential primary, the University of
   Massachusetts/WHDH poll found.

   Grouped closely behind are Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, each with 13
   percent, followed by Jeb Bush and John Kasich, at 10 percent each.

   The trailers are Chris Christie (5 percent); Carly Fiorina (4 percent)
   and Ben Carson (3 percent).

   “This is everything for [Kasich and Christie],” pollster Joshua Dyck
   told The Post on Monday. “I think one of them will survive, maybe.”

   Kasich has already announced he’ll pull out of the race if he doesn’t
   do well in New Hampshire.

   The poll was conducted between Friday and Sunday, so Saturday night’s
   GOP debate may have affected some responses, but only slightly.

   Pollsters found that 75 percent of the state’s Republican-leaning
   voters who favor Trump will “definitely” vote for him, with 57 percent
   of Cruz supporters saying they were certain to vote for their
   candidate.

   The same pollsters showed Bernie Sanders with a 56-to-40-percent lead
   over Hillary Clinton among Dems.
