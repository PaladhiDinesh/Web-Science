   Woman Keeps McDonald’s Happy Meal Untouched For Six Years – And This Is
   The Shocking Result Anthony Pearce's Blog Monday, February 8, 2016
   A mum claims to have conducted an experiment where she kept a
   McDonald’s Happy Meal for SIX years – just to see if it would
   decompose.
   Jennifer Lovdahl, from Alaska, in the U.S., posted a status on Facebook
   about a meal she bought from the fast food chain back in 2010.
   She said: “It’s been 6 years since I bought this “Happy Meal” at
   McDonald’s. It’s been sitting at our office this whole time.”
   Shockingly, the attached pictures – one of the box, with receipt,
   another of the meal itself – show that the food has hardly changed.
   [2]She wrote: “[It] has not rotted, moulded, or decomposed at all!!! It
   smells only of cardboard. We did this experiment to show our patients
   how unhealthy this “food” is. Especially for our growing children!!
   She added: “There are so many chemicals in this food! Choose real food!
   Apples, bananas, carrots, celery….those are real fast food.”
   The picture shows four chicken nuggets with fries, both of which look
   slightly paler that usual, but otherwise are the same.
   The receipt on the box reads 8 January, 2010, although it had not been
   confirmed that the image is real.
