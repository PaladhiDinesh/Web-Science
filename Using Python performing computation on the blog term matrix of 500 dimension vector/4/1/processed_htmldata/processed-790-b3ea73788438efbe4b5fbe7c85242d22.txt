   Back in 1990 I was working for Drake Publishing, churning out porn
   magazines. I worked mostly on Cheri, but also a little bit for High
   Society, Celebrity Skin, and a real bottom feeder called LIVE! I also
   did a few issues of Buxom (have to say putting word balloons on boobs
   was a lot of fun -- wish I could remember the jokes), Climax, and some
