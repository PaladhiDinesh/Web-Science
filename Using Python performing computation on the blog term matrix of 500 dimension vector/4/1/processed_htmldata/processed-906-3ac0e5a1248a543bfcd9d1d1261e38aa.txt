   Meet my version of The McWhopper [Photographs: J. Kenji Lopez-Alt]

   Burger King's marketing team has always been better than its culinary
   team, and their latest publicity stunt is one of the best I've ever
   seen. Their proposal? That on September 21st, World Peace Day, Burger
   King and arch-rival McDonald's bury the hatchet, putting aside their
   beef with each other's beef, and open up a one-day-only pop-up
   restaurant in Atlanta (midway between their corporate headquarters)
   serving McWhoppers, a hybrid between the Whopper and the Big Mac, their
   respective flagship sandwiches. I decided to deal with the
   disappointment of never seeing this sandwich come to fruition the only
   way I know how: by making it myself.

   This burger was created to help spread awareness for September 21st,
   World Peace Day. See [19]Peace One Day for more information.

Why It Works

   Whole Story
     * By combining the best elements of Burger King and McDonald's—the
       flame-broiled beef and the special sauce, respectively—you end up
       with one spectacular fast food burger.

Ingredients

     * 2 medium onion
     * 3 tablespoons mayonnaise
     * 1 tablespoon sweet pickle relish
     * 2 teaspoons yellow mustard
     * 1 tablespoon ketchup
     * 2 teaspoons sugar
     * 1/4 teaspoon marmite, vegemite, Maggi seasoning, or soy sauce
     * 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
     * 3 seeded hamburger buns
     * 14 ounces fresh ground beef chuck
     * Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
     * 2 slices American cheese
     * 3/4 cup shredded iceberg lettuce
     * 6 slices fresh tomato
     * 8 dill pickle chips

Directions

    1. 1.
       Finely mince half of the onion and place on a double layer of paper
       towels on a microwave-safe plate and microwave for 10 minutes on
       low power until mostly dehydrated but not browned. Set aside.
    2. 2.
       Meanwhile, divide remaining half onion into two pieces. Thinly
       slice one piece pole-to-pole and set aside.
    3. 3.
       Take remaining quarter onion and grate it on a microplane grater or
       he small holes of a box grater. Transfer to a medium bowl. Add
       mayonnnaise, relish, mustard, ketchup, sugar, marmite, and turmeric
       and stir to combine thoroughly. Season to taste with freshly ground
       black pepper
    4. 4.
       Using a sharp, thin knife, carefully remove the crust from the
       bottom half of one of the buns and the crust from the top of its
       partner to form two "center" buns for the constructed McWhoppers.
       Set buns aside.
    5. 5.
       [22]Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is
       lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on
       one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover
       grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half
       the burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting, cover, and
       preheat for 10 minutes. [23]Clean and [24]oil the grilling grate.
    6. 6.
       While grill preheats, divide ground beef into 4 even balls. Press
       them into very thin, even patties about 1/2 inch wider than
       diameter of the buns.
    7. 7.
       Season patties generously with salt and pepper and place directly
       over hot side of grill. Cover and cook until grill marks appear,
       about 2 minutes. Rotate patties 90 degrees and continue cooking
       until well-charred on first side and juices are beginning to bubble
       up through the top of the patties, about 2 minutes longer.
    8. 8.
       Carefully flip patties and top two of them with a slice of American
       cheese. Immediately transfer the patties to the coolest part of the
       grill. Toast burger buns over direct heat until nicely browned.
       Transfer buns to a serving platter.
    9. 9.
       To construct burgers, spread 1/4 of sauce evenly over each bottom
       bun. Add divide fresh onions evenly between them, then add 1/4 of
       shredded lettuce to each. Add tomato slices. Top with the
       cheese-topped beef patties followed by the center buns. Spread
       remaining sauce evenly over the two middle buns, top with pickles,
       followed by the remaining beef patties, the dehydrated onions, and
       more shredded iceberg. Close the burgers and serve.
