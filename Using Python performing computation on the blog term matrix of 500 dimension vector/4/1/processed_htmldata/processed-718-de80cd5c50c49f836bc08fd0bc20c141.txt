On primary eve, Trump touts early opening for D.C. hotel

   By [238]Kyle Cheney

   02/08/16 02:53 PM EST

   HAMPTON, N.H. — A day before voters head to the polls in the
   presidential primary here, Donald Trump’s company blasted out a press
   release declaring that he would open the Trump International Hotel in
   Washington, D.C. — just a few blocks east of the White House — in
   September, two years ahead of schedule.

   The hotel, which will occupy the Old Post Office building on
   Pennsylvania Avenue, would open at a crucial point in the general
   election timeline, should Trump win the Republican nomination in July.
   The project has been a regular part of Trump’s speeches on the campaign
   trail, a talking point in support of his claim that he’s a master
   negotiator and was able to win approval for his project from the Obama
   administration.

   The press release, though, heaps praise on the federal government —
   specifically the General Services Administration — for helping the
   project move forward.

   “For decades people have looked in wonderment at the magnificence of
   the Old Post Office building and structure. There is nothing like it
   and we are so proud to have not only brought this incredible building
   back to life, but also to a position far greater than it ever was at
   its previous zenith,’ Trump said in a statement. “It was an honor to
   have dealt with the professionals at the General Services
   Administration. It was their total passion and hard work that helped
   bring this unrivaled project to fruition.

   The release also included a statement from Trump’s daughter, Ivanka,
   who is expected to join Trump’s other children in running the company
   should Trump win the presidency.

   The hotel includes 263 rooms and 35 suites, as well as a 13,200-foot
   “Presidential Ballroom.”
