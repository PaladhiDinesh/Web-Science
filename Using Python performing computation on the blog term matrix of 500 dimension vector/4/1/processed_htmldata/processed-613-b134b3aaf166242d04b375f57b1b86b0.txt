Sarah Palin Defends Donald Trump Against Pro-Life Women

   Palin on CNN

   by [25]Dr. Susan Berry1 Feb 2016[26]0
   1 Feb, 2016 1 Feb, 2016

Sarah Palin defended Donald Trump’s reversal on abortion Monday against
pro-life women who say they are “disgusted” by him and are urging Republicans
to vote for anyone but him.

   “I’m so glad that Mr. Trump has seen the light and understands the
   sanctity of innocent life and how a baby in the womb should be most
   protected,” Palin [27]said during an interview on CNN, according to
   Politico.

   “What has been kind of sad about the situation, though, politically
   speaking, are groups that are pro-life and want to, they say they want
   to bring more people into the fold,” she continued. “They [are] giving
   Trump a hard time for his past views on abortion.”

   In 1999, Trump said during an interview with NBC’s Meet the Press that
   he was “very pro-choice.” Since then, Trump has said he is pro-life.

   “Let me be clear – I am pro-life,” Trump [28]wrote last week in a
   Washington Examiner op-ed.

   “Over time, our culture of life in this country has started sliding
   toward a culture of death,” Trump added. “Over 50 million Americans
   never had the chance to enjoy the opportunities offered by this
   country,” he said, speaking about the numbers of aborted babies in the
   United States since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision 43 years
   ago.

   In addition, Trump acknowledges he was pro-choice prior to a personal
   experience that changed his mind about abortion.

   However, a group of state and national pro-life women leaders [29]urged
   Iowa voters last week to support any GOP candidate except Trump. They
   said:

     Trump cannot be trusted and there is, thankfully, an abundance of
     alternative candidates with proven records of pro-life leadership
     whom pro-life voters can support. We have come to this conclusion
     after having listened patiently to numerous debates and news
     reports, but most importantly to Donald Trump’s own words.

   The pro-life women went on to explain they are “disgusted” by Trump’s
   treatment of women, particularly Fox News host Megyn Kelly and his GOP
   rival Carly Fiorina.

   “He has impugned the dignity of women,” they asserted, pointing out
   that Trump’s Atlantic City casino hotel boasted the first strip club
   casino in the nation.

   President of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List Marjorie Dannenfelser
   is among the women activists protesting Trump. She said regarding
   Palin’s defense of the GOP frontrunner, “She should know that the
   conversion is good news but the critical question is are you ready to
   advance, defend and answer questions on the issue. If not, then you’re
   not ready for prime time. She of all people should understand that.”

   “Trump cannot handle the most basic of questions, begging off and
   claiming everyone knows the answer,” Dannenfelser added. “Palin and
   Trump should know what happens when you are ill prepared. You will be
   squashed and the cause you purport to support will suffer for it.”
