   Bernie Sanders Calls Wal-Mart Walton Family Wealth Unacceptable

   “The major welfare abuser in America is the wealthiest family in
   America, the Walton family,” Sen. Bernie Sanders says, referring to
   founders of Wal-Mart Stores.
     * Walton family demonstrates nation’s “rigged” economy in that
       Wal-Mart doesn’t pay its employees a “living wage,” forcing many
       workers to turn to food stamps, Medicaid and subsidized housing
       funded by taxpayers, the Democratic presidential candidate says at
       campaign event in Keene, N.H.
          + “I say to the Walton family, get off of welfare. Pay your
            workers a living wage”
     * Sanders says it’s unacceptable that Walton family has more wealth
       than bottom 40% of Americans
     * Says income, wealth inequality in U.S. worse today than any time
       since 1928
     * NOTE: Wal-Mart, Walton family representatives didn’t immediately
       respond to request for comment
     * NOTE: Sanders is campaigning in N.H. ahead of that state’s Feb. 9
       primary; he came in 2nd to rival Hillary Clinton yday in Iowa
       caucuses, losing 1st place by less than 1 ppt
