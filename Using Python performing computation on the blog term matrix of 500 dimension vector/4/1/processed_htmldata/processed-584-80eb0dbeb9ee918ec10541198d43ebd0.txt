Mexican ex-president: No, we won't pay for Trump's 'stupid wall'

   By [246]Nick Gass

   02/08/16 12:13 PM EST

   Updated 02/08/16 04:04 PM EST
   [247]Share on Facebook [248]Share on Twitter

   Former Mexican President Felipe Calderon assailed Donald Trump's call
   to build a wall between his country and the United States and make
   Mexico pay for it as "stupid," calling the Republican candidate "not
   [a] very well-informed man" and "completely crazy."

   "Mexican people, we are not going to pay any single cent for such a
   stupid wall," Calderon [249]told CNBC in a recent interview. "And it's
   going to be completely useless."

   Story Continued Below

   The U.S. would stand to be the first loser of such a wall, said
   Calderon, who served as president of Mexico from 2006 to 2012.

   "If this guy pretends that closing the borders to anywhere either for
   trade [or] for people is going to provide prosperity to the United
   States, he is completely crazy," Calderon said.

   During his campaign launch last June, Trump made a point of emphasizing
   the role that border security and immigration would play in his
   campaign, pointing to Mexico as one country where [t]hey're bringing
   drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are
   good people."

   "It is incredible that a quite admirable society like the American
   society could produce such kind of candidates," Calderon continued. "I
   cannot understand that. No offense, no offense to America. So Donald
   Trump … is ambitious but not exactly [a] very well-informed man. I
   don't want to say ignorant, but he is not very well informed."

   Trump responded Monday on MSNBC, insisting that Calderon was wrong.
   “He’ll pay. Trust me, he’ll pay,” Trump said. “We have such a trade
   imbalance with Mexico. We have such a trade deficit. The wall is
   peanuts compared to that number.”
