Trump vs. Fox: Who's Winning?

Does the Billionaire Candidate Actually Need the Net's Blessing?

   What use does a billionaire have for a kingmaker? It's a question media
   watchers and political junkies are gnawing on like a terrier worrying a
   rat, as Donald Trump continues his churlish and improbable bid for the
   Republican nomination. Does the billionaire who pays his own freight
   actually require the blessing of the news network that admirers and
   detractors alike believe serves as a gatekeeper to the GOP?

   After bailing on [133]Fox News Channel's Jan. 28 GOP debate, the
   frontrunner suffered the first significant reversal of his campaign,
   losing the Iowa caucus to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and barely holding off
   Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for second.

   Speaking to reporters in New Hampshire as his next test loomed, Mr.
   Trump acknowledged that skipping the debate likely contributed to his
   defeat. "That could have been with the debate," Mr. Trump said. "I
   think some people were disappointed that I didn't go into the debate."

   While ditching out may have sent the wrong message to Iowa -- Mr. Trump
   won only 13% of voters who made their decision after the debate, while
   Sen. Rubio took 31% -- the anti-establishment candidate also faced a
   strong turnout by staunch conservatives and evangelicals. But FNC
   wasn't having any of that. After the results came in, network pundits
   repeatedly suggested that Mr. Trump's absence led to his also-ran
   finish. "Trump missed his opportunity to make his closing arguments,
   and it looks like he's paying a price for it here," said FNC
   contributor Kirsten Powers.

   Then again, Mr. Trump may have fared even worse if he had taken the
   debate stage. FNC moderator Megyn Kelly, the object of much of Mr.
   Trump's petulant ire, deftly used video clips to illustrate how Sens.
   Cruz and Rubio have a tendency to talk out of both sides of their
   mouths. Neither pol held up well under Ms. Kelly's interrogation, and
   one can only imagine how the mercurial real estate mogul would have
   fared.

   If it's too soon to make a definitive judgment on whether Donald Trump
   needs Fox News more than Fox News needs Donald Trump, the events in
   Iowa suggested that neither entity will be so careless as to ever again
   take the other for granted. But FNC's Iowa debate was its second
   most-watched program in its 20-year history, and advertisers thus far
   are very pleased with their investment. That's a win. After losing in
   Iowa, Mr. Trump appeared on Sean Hannity's show to spin the numbers and
   swear that everything had been smoothed over with Fox. As it stands,
   the score is Fox News 1, Donald J. Trump 0. Check again after Tuesday's
   results in New Hampshire.
