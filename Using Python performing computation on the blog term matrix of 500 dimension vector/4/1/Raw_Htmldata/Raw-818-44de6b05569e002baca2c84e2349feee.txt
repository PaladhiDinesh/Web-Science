<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><meta http-equiv="Content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"><meta name="keywords" content="Particle News, Particle Media, News"><meta name="description" content=" (CNN)Responding to a volley of critical tweets and comments from Jeb Bush, Donald Trump on Monday called his rival -- the son of one president and brother of another -- an &quot;embarrassment to his family.&quot;
Moments earlier, Bush told CNN's Dana Bash he was a &quot;joyful warrior,&quot; who wouldn't sit back and watch &quot;someone try to hijack a party that I believe will allow people to rise up again.&quot; 
Trump, who had been watching Bush's interview, fired back immediately, launching a series of aggressive attacks and insults at the former Florida governor.
&quot;Jeb is having some kind of a breakdown,&quot; he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. &quot;He's an embarrassment to his family. He has to bring his mother out and walk his mother around at 90 years old. I think it's a very sad situation that's taking place.&quot;
&quot;Frankly, he's a stiff,&quot; Trump said. &quot;He's not a guy who can be president. He doesn't have what it takes to be president.&quot;
Barbara Bush, Jeb's mother, recently joined her son on the campaign trail in New Hampshire, where the former first lady ripped Trump, saying she was &quot;sick of him&quot; and &quot;not crazy about what he says about women.&quot;
Trump, though, kept his focus trained on Jeb Bush.
&quot;He's a desperate person. He's a sad and a pathetic person. He doesn't even use his last name in his ad,&quot; Trump said, asked to react to a tweet Bush's campaign sent out earlier calling him a &quot;loser&quot; and a &quot;liar.&quot; &quot;He's a sad person who has gone absolutely crazy. I mean, this guy is a nervous wreck.&quot;
The billionaire also swatted away Bush's claim to being the only GOP candidate willing to stand toe-to-toe with Trump on the debate stage.
