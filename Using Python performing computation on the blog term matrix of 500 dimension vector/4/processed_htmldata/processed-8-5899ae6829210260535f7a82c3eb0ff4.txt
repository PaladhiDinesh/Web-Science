   Police say they're searching for two pranksters who allegedly broke
   into a conductor's booth aboard an R train in Manhattan and announced
   over the public address system the train had been hijacked by ISIS,
   according to MTA sources.

   The incident happened on the Brooklyn-bound train between the 23rd
   Street and Union Square stations late Thursday night.

   said.

   Police said they're searching for the suspects, believed to be in their
   20s.

   Crozier told the Post.
