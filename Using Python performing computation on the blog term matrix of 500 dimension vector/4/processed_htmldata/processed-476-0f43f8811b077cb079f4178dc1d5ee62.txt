   DIY Game Day Snack Stadium #GameDayGlory AD #football #snacks
   It’s playoff time and excitement is in the air! We love to have people
   over to watch games and cheer on our favorite teams. What does every
   football party need? Great friends and great snacks. This year I
   decided to celebrate with a fun, DIY snack stadium.

   When I sat down to design the snack stadium, I wasn’t sure what size to
   make it. I realized that size hinged on the materials I used. I
   considered wood, but that would make for a heavy stadium and require
   painting. You all know that I am a simple kind of gal, so I wanted my
   stadium to be easy. I decided to use white foam boards. They are light,
   easy to cut, and make for easy storage. The standard size of a foam
   board is 20″ x 30″, so I knew my size limits. I grabbed some graph
   paper and started designing.

   aJJSvvd0fRXx4UZt0vEDV3IrWSWjk9PTwhyUzK1nwAo0RBlyRWcMZwct3P4TnODUVn]
   I began thinking of how I wanted to decorate the snack stadium. I have
   access to a printer that makes 11″ x 17″ prints, so I created large
   graphics. I decided to cut them in half so that they can be printed on
   a standard printer. I am offering both the 11″ x 17″ and 8.5″ x 11″
   graphics as a free download so that you can print and decorate your own
   stadium.

   GuqAgGXSpBU6d8VSdWUVh4QmUzrpjuFzFl9DoiRU_K_p2ZYEmmm9zM26e1k-DQVC21]
   Using your utility cutter carefully cut out the foam stadium pieces
   along the marked lines.

   Assemble your snack stadium as follows:

     * Attach pieces A & C to form the inside walls of the stadium.
     * Attach pieces E to each corner.
     * Attach pieces B & D to create the outside walls of the stadium.
     * Attach pieces F to the outside corners to finish off the stadium
       structure.
     * Optional: Attach pieces X1 & X2 for inside platform if desired. We
       had to trim these slightly for them to fit.

   I used white utility tape along the edges to hold them together. I put
   it together with small pieces of tape and then went back and used
   bigger pieces of tape to make the corner edges nicer.

   Decorate your snack stadium. I attached the pennants to baker’s twine
   and strung it between skewers stuck into the outside edge.

   Here is how I filled the stadium:

     * I created Skittles® Candy Bark* and placed it in the end zone.
       *recipe below
     * I opened a tall jar of TOSTITOS® Medium Chunky Salsa and placed it
       in the middle of the sidelines. TOSTITOS® Original Tortilla Chips
       filled the space on each side of the salsa.
     * I opened jar of queso and placed it to the other side of the
       stadium flanked by TOSTITOS® Scoops.
     * SNICKERS® Minis were placed in two corners of the endzone and
       Skittles® were placed in the other two.
     * Pepsi™ 20 oz. bottles were placed on the outside corners of the
       stadium.
     * Football players were created with SNICKERS® Minis and soft taffy
       candies. I unwrapped red and yellow soft taffy candies and
       microwaved them for about 3 seconds to soften. I cut each in half,
       rolled each into a little round helmet shape, and place on top of
       unwrapped the SNICKERS® Minis. The helmets stuck to the chocolate
       as it hardened.

   I picked up all my supplies for this snack stadium at [29]Walmart. No
   game day celebration is complete without chips and dips, soda, and
   candy. I picked up SNICKERS® Minis 40oz., Skittles® XL 41 oz.,
   TOSTITOS® Medium Chunky Salsa, TOSTITOS® Original Party Size and Scoops
   Party Size, and
   Pepsi™ 20 oz. bottles.
