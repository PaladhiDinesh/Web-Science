Donald Trump vs. Ted Cruz: A fight for conservatism’s future?

   NASHUA, N.H. — The battle between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump isn’t just
   a fight for the Republican presidential nomination. It’s also a
   struggle for the soul of conservatism in America.

   Trump, the blunt real estate mogul new to political combat, represents
   a less ideological brand of conservatism, one that is more a quick
   reaction to events. Build a wall to discourage illegal immigration and
   potentially create a new bureaucracy to round up people for
   deportation. Question Muslims coming into the country. His solutions
   are rooted less in ideological theory. He is above all else a
   negotiator, a deal maker.

   Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas with a sharp, deeply felt conservative
   message, offers a solid ideological foundation. His ideas stem from a
   firm belief in smaller government, philosophies with lineage that goes
   back to the mid-20th century. He does not negotiate. He does not deal.
   When Washington moves toward spending more, he stands in the Capitol
   door threatening a shutdown over any compromise going in the direction
   of more government.

   Trump’s effort to reshape conservatism in his own image is the newest
   iteration of a battle that dates back decades. Conservatism was nothing
   new, but was largely a loose collection of those opposed to the 1930s
   New Deal and its expansion of government. William F. Buckley Jr., the
   author and commentator, thought the ideology needed more of an
   intellectual bent, and he started National Review in 1955 as a forum
   for developing a solid philosophy.

   Those views, honed and promoted over the years, helped create separate
   identities for the two major political parties. Think Democrats and
   liberals, big government, diversity. Republicans: Lower taxes, law and
   order, muscular foreign policy.

   But Republicans in Washington have compromised. Spending has gone up.
   Government has grown. The party wins more seats in Congress, but seems
   to lose battles. Now comes this campaign, with Trump appealing to
   populists while brushing off some of the details of conservatism, and
   Cruz emerging as the voice of all those who want to draw a line.

   Cruz won round one Monday, as he topped Trump in Iowa’s Republican
   caucus. They face each other next in New Hampshire, then in South
   Carolina and perhaps beyond.

   On one side is the voice of Trump and the populists, feeling
   increasingly disenfranchised and frightened that their comfortable, if
   romanticized, way of life is slipping away. They seem unbothered when
   Trump defines conservatism as he sees fit. Spending is fine, he
   suggests, as long as it’s to stop illegal immigration. Nor do his
   supporters appear to mind what could be construed as opportunism, since
   he supported abortion rights or government-run health care several
   years ago.

   They’re not rabid partisans, and through the years their allegiances
   have shifted. Andrew Jackson was the founder of the modern Democratic
   Party. George Wallace in 1968 and Ross Perot in 1992 ran as
   independents. Wallace was the champion of the Southern white alarmed by
   racial integration and a society that had lost its moral compass. Perot
   mobilized a middle class troubled by runaway federal spending and
   seeing the two political parties as unresponsive.

   Their nemesis is the conservative establishment, painstakingly
   constructed and nurtured since the 1950s. It’s leaning gingerly to
   Cruz, but it might accept Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) who finished a
   close third in Iowa.

   “Ideology is getting lost here,” said Rich Lowry, editor of National
   Review, the conservative magazine that argues strongly against Trump’s
   message.

   Movement conservatives see 2016 as a rare opportunity to seize
   ideological control of Washington. The House of Representatives is
   solidly Republican and looks likely to stay that way. The Senate might
   go Democratic, but that’s no sure bet. Winning the White House could
   give Republicans power they have rarely had in the last century.

   Buckley understood the conservative cause could not succeed only as a
   proletarian uprising. “Idealism is fine,” he said, “but as it
   approaches reality, the costs become prohibitive.”

   The movement became an important political force in the 1960s,
   providing a libertarian, academic counterpoint to the expanding
   government that FDR’s New Deal had spawned and LBJ’s Great Society was
   about to greatly expand.

   Barry Goldwater’s 1960 “Conscience of a Conservative” became the
   manifesto. Conservatives, he said, saw “politics as the art of
   achieving the maximum amount of freedom for individuals that is
   consistent with the maintenance of the social order.”

   Goldwater won the GOP nomination in 1964 but was crushed in the general
   election. His followers were energized, though; they had created a
   movement strong enough to win the party’s biggest campaign prize. By
   1976, its leader now Ronald Reagan, the movement just missed denying
   moderate Republican President Gerald Ford his party’s nomination. Four
   years later, Reagan ran and won on a platform largely faithful to
   Goldwater’s ideas.

   The Republican Party now is unquestionably the conservative party. Yet
   it’s not a unified party.
