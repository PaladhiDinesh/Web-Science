   Week of February 5‚Äì12, 2016
   Riders this past week: 12,871
   Rider miles this past week: 104,712

   DOWN IN THE TUBE
   Jules Feiffer, the cartoonist, was seen on the subway heading from Sag
   Harbor to East Hampton on Friday afternoon. He was sketching people
   sitting near him. Some laughed. Others ran away.

   PROMOTING THE TOWNS
   Beginning next week, subway riders will be able to get a brief history
   of the town or village they are about to stop at. Look for the big blue
   button just to the right of the subway doors before you exit, press it,
   and a recorded voice will announce the next stop and then give a 15
   second summary of its attributes. For example, at [88]Bridgehampton,
   the voice says ‚ÄúBridgehampton, the home of baseball player [89]Carl
   Yastrzemski, potato farmers, the Beebee Windmill and the Candy
   Kitchen.‚Äù Just be sure not to press the button when the voice is about
   to announce ‚Äúwatch out for the closing doors.‚Äù That could cause people
   to get batted around or pinched up.

   ALTERNATE TRANSPORTATION
   As you probably know, Hamptons Subway provides alternative
   transportation for people who suffer from claustrophobia and are
   uncomfortable going through tunnels. On presenting a letter from a
   doctor, any straphanger can get passage on Hamptons Subway by going up
   the stairs and out to the street where eight-seat mini-vans are parked
   ready to take sufferers to wherever they want on our route. Just swipe
   your subway card when you get on. But now, we are taking the mini-vans
   out of service. They are being replaced by open convertibles and pickup
   trucks with bench seating in the back for the customers who now,
   sitting pretty much out in the open, should be just fine.

   SUBWAY COMMISSIONER VOTE LOOMS
   Anita Atlas, one of the stockholders of Hamptons Subway has challenged
   Bill Aspinall for the chairmanship of the Hamptons Subway, so,
   according to the bylaws, there has to be a vote. It‚Äôs now scheduled for
   March 10, and in anticipation of it, a debate was supposed to take
   place two days ago in the assembly hall of the Hamptons Subway building
   in Hampton Bays at 7 p.m. It never happened, though. Atlas pulled out
   when she learned that the moderator was to be Carly McKracken, who
   famously married Anita‚Äôs first husband, and the two are not friends.
   Anita said she would consider coming if there were a different
   moderator and would look at a list that Hamptons Subway could provide
   her to see who she considered acceptable, but that list has not yet
   happened. Atlas also called Aspinall ‚Äústupid.‚Äù We don‚Äôt know how this
   will wind up.

   MEDICAL MARIJUANA
   Hamptons Subway made an application to the state to be allowed to sell
   medical marijuana at the newsstands down on our platforms. We
   considered it a long shot. Nevertheless, as it has turned out, we were
   approved. Between Montauk and Westhampton, to get your medical
   marijuana, you will have to go down to the platform nearest to you and
   buy it at the newsstand that is there. Just remember there is no
   smoking on the subway platforms or cars so after you get it‚Äîin its
   tightly wrapped butcher paper‚Äîjust carry it with you up and out to the
   street before you use it. Yes, you will have to swipe your subway card
   to get there.

   COMMISSIONER ASPINALL‚ÄôS MESSAGE
   My compliments to our staff during the recent blizzard. I understand
   all the trains kept to their schedules. And the snow shovelers kept all
   the steps clear at the stops. Aloha from the British Virgins.
