The real Gigabit Challenge is getting ISPs to think like tech firms, The
Web-Deprived Study at McDonald's and more

   February 4, 2013 By [60]Ryan Kamauff

   logoimage Here are the top tech news and stories of the day.
     * PBS tweet entices SuperBowl watchers to Downton Abbey: how it
       happened - During last night's epic Super Bowl blackout, Marketing
       and Communications director of PBS, Kevin Dando, used Twitter to
       grab viewers for their network. The Super Bowl (the most watched
       television event of all time) was blacked out for 34 minutes. PBS's
       tweet was their second most popular tweet of the year.  Via Paid
       Content, more here.
     * The real Gigabit Challenge is getting ISPs to think like tech firms
       - More and more cities are looking to make gigabit connections to
       households a municipal matter. In this article, the author argues
       that Telcos need to increase R&D and operational investment, to
       push the threshold of the services they can offer. However, since
       Telcos believe they are just delivering a commodity, to do little
       to differentiate on quality but rather on price. Via GigaOM, more
       [61]here.
     * The Web-Deprived Study at McDonald's - In many families and
       communities, broadband internet is not accessible. I've often
       mentioned how close to (or more than) 50% of the internet using
       population uses it primarily from mobile devices, so this should be
       no surprise. In these neighborhoods, children congregate at the
       local McDonald's to take advantage of the free broadband. It seems
       sometimes that the digital divide, even as mobile and other costs
       go down, is staying the same (or growing) due to a lack of
       broadband in many rural communities. Via WSJ, more [62]here.
     * This Text String Crashes Almost Any App on a Mac Running Mountain
       Lion - Apparently there is a little "easter egg" of sorts in OS X
       Mountain Lion. The string: "File:///" automatically stops most apps
       in the OS. It seems to only work on Mountain Lion versions (not
       older versions) check it out for yourself. Via Gizmodo, more
       [63]here.
     * Another Microsoft partner plays the field: HP outs a $329
       Chromebook - HP is releasing details on their forthcoming
       Chromebook. I've been using a Chromebook for a few months, and have
       to say I am very impressed with what Samsung and Google teamed up
       to deliver. HP's will be $329, with a 14" screen (the largest among
       all Chromebooks). The device is around 4 lbs with a 4-hour battery
       (very different than the ARM Chromebook I use). Clearly the
       ChromeOS is gaining traction among OEMs, schools and other outfits,
       and may soon take the "Wintel" world by storm. Via GigaOM, more
       [64]here.
