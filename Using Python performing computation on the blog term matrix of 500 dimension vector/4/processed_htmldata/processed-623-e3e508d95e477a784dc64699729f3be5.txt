Scott Brown Touts Trump Ground Game, ‘Phone Banks Humming’ in New Hampshire

Former Massachusetts Republican Senator Scott Brown told Breitbart News Daily
host Stephen K. Bannon today he sees Donald Trump winning the New Hampshire
primary with John Kasich coming in second and “Rubio right there in third.”

   Brown previously thought Rubio would finish second. That was before New
   Jersey Governor Chris Christie banged the Florida Senator up pretty
   good in Saturday’s Republican debate. Brown called Rubio “brilliant,”
   adding that he considered him a good friend, but felt the cage match
   with Christie really hurt him.

   Asked about Trump’s “ground game,” Brown said he was confident the
   businessman has a good one in New Hampshire.

   “When I endorsed him I told him what needed to be done. There was
   basically no ground game” said Brown, while admitting Trump didn’t have
   a solid one in Iowa but placed second anyway.

   As for New Hampshire, Brown said Trump asked him if he would help, “So,
   I dropped everything and we’ve already gotten the phone banks humming.
   We’ve gotten the door knockers out. We had a great 72-hour plan that’s
   been implemented. Weather permitting, we’re encouraging people right
   now to go to their townhalls” to get an absentee ballot if needed to
   avoid not voting due to inclement weather on election day.

   Brown also predicted record turn out on the Republican side due to
   enthusiasm and cited enthusiasm on the Democrat side, as well. Brown
   predicted Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) would win given the dislike for
   Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire among leftists and various activist
   factions of the Democrat base. “She’s part of Wall Street. She’s part
   of big banks. She’s a liar. They don’t trust her. She may be indicted,
   so they’re going for Bernie big time.

   Brown predicted a solid double digit win for Bernie sanders over
   Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire.

   The entire interview with former Massachusetts Senator Scott brown on
   Breitbart News Daily can be heard below.
