The New York City Subway:

21 lines
469 stations
660 miles of track
Spotty cell signals

The Subspotting project captures, maps and visualizes the available cell
phone reception in the entire New York City Subway
     __________________________________________________________________

   Over a period of two weeks, the Subspotting project logged the cell
   phone reception of New York City’s four major phone carriers along all
   21 lines, 469 stations, and 660 miles of track covered by the MTA.

   The result is a visual portrait of the electromagnetic fields of New
   York City’s underground – a map that highlights the system’s dead
   spots, stretches of spotty signals and available pockets of
   connectivity.

The Most Connected

   [7.svg]
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

   The 7 train mostly runs aboveground, making it the most connected line
   with about 79% being connected. Even when going underground in
   Manhattan, it receives enough stray signals to keep you connected for
   most of your ride.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

The Least Connected

   [G.svg]
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

   With only about 12% of its entire length connected, the G train is the
   least connected train of the subway. You can find just a few tiny
   pockets of service around Smith / 9th Street and south of Court Square.
     __________________________________________________________________

     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

   Spotty reception most of the way from South Ferry to 125th Street, due
   to stray signals from aboveground.

Electromagnetic patterns

Each line has its very own electromagnetic pattern and characteristics, from
extended dead spots and pockets of strong reception to spotty service due to
stray signals from overground transmitters.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

Overground

   [A.svg]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [overground-line-chart.svg]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Around 40% of the MTA’s 660 miles of track run aboveground. Bridges and
   short aboveground stretches provide reception for brief moments along
   the journey.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

Deadspots

   [Q.svg]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [deadspots-line-chart.svg]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Unlike other subway systems, New York City’s tunnels are currently not
   equipped with WiFi or cell phone transmitters. So inevitably each of
   the lines comes with dead spots along the way.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

Spotty Signals

   [F.svg]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [spotty-signal-line-chart.svg]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Spotty underground signals are caused by stray reception from
   aboveground cell phone transmitters. Their strength varies according to
   the depth of the tunnel and even the type of materials in between cell
   phone transmitter and the tunnel.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

Carrier Differences

   [6.svg]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [carrier-differences-line-chart.svg]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Each carrier has a different aboveground transmitter density and
   placement – as you can assume, these also affect their underground
   coverage.

Please note!

   Cell phone reception is highly variably and changes over time. The
   Subspotting project provides a snapshot in time of cell phone reception
   in the New York City subway.

   The data for these visualizations is based on a one-time measurement of
   each subway line. To stay up to date about your reception underground

The background

Since the New York City subway tunnels are currently not wired for
connectivity, cell phone reception outside of stations is partially dependent
on stray signals from aboveground
     __________________________________________________________________

   [map-mta.jpg]

The system

   New York City’s very first subway line opened back in 1904: the
   original Eighth Avenue Line connected 207th Street and High Street.

   Today, the entire system is comprised of 21 official lines and 469
   stations across the five boroughs and carries an average of 5.6 million
   passengers along its 660 miles of track every day.

   In recent years, the MTA has started to equip select stations with WiFi
   and cell phone transmitters, but due to the remaining lack of
   connectivity in the tunnels, passengers rely on stray signals from
   surface transmitters to send or receive messages in between stations.

The origins of cell phone reception

   Mobile phone reception is based on the original discovery of
   electromagnetic waves in 1886 by German physicist Heinrich Hertz.

   Phones today sense the invisible radio waves with their antennas and
   use the electromagnetic spectrum to connect to different signal
   transmitters while we move through the city.

   Despite the increasing density of phone towers, even reception today
   still varies depending on proximity to a tower / transmitter and any
   interference from buildings, trees, and even the weather.

   A common sight in New York City:

   even fishing for service while underground.

The process

Over the course of two weeks, our data logger travelled the entire subway to
create a unique data set that has not been logged in its entirety before.

     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

01 Creating the custom data logger

   To record the data, we created a custom app that continuously logged
   the cell phone reception of each of the four major carriers in
   two-second intervals: AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon. Since each
   phone can only log one carrier at a time, our data logger consisted of
   four iPhone 5S, all neatly stored in a non-shielded case.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [loggerphones.png]
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

02 Logging the data

   Over the course of two weeks, our data logger travelled the entire
   subway system (once in either direction) to capture this unique data
   set.  Planning the logger's route took some time: since several lines
   use the same track at parts of their route, these parts only needed to
   be measured once (e.g., the 1, 2, and 3 trains use the same track
   between 59 St Columbus Circle and 96 St).

   Below, the measurements of the 1 train from Van Cortlandt Park to South
   Ferry. (Sprint, Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile):

     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

03 Data validation and cleaning

   After two weeks of data collection, we validated our results by
   calculating the correlation between riding the train in both directions
   to make sure our measurements were accurate.
   We cleaned up the data to remove errors and distilled the data into one
   distinct dataset per line containing the measurements for the four main
   carriers: AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint.

04 Adding context

   While data just by itself can seem mysterious, adding contextual
   information helps to understand it. Besides adding stations and
   boroughs to each of the lines we also indicated the WiFi enabled
   stations as well as underground and overground segments by hand. Below,
   the contextualized data of the 1 train.

     __________________________________________________________________

05 Simplifying the data

   The original cell phone data was logged in two-second intervals.
    To make it usable for the iPhone app, we aggregated the dataset into
   more comprehensible segments of time (green).
     __________________________________________________________________

     __________________________________________________________________

06 The output

   Based on this dataset, the app displays each line of the New York City
   subway with its available cell phone reception.  It additionally
   indicates the WiFi enabled stations, boroughs, and aboveground and
   underground stretches.
