   “Why is Fox News feuding with Donald Trump?” [40]Stephen Colbert asked
   FNC show host [41]Megyn Kelly on tonight’s live post-Super Bowl
   broadcast of [42]The Late Show. “What do you have against that good
   man. He’s just a billionaire who also wants to have the nuclear launch
   codes.”

   Kelly responded: “Donald Trump has been on Fox News 140 times in the
   last year. We are not feuding with him. But he does have a beef with
   me.”

   Colbert noted Trump’s tweet of a while back in which he said he would
   not call Kelly a “bimbo” because that would be politically incorrect,
   and would instead call her a “lightweight reporter,” wondering if Kelly
   would like to refuse to call Trump a “blowhard” or “second-place
   loser.”

   “The only thing I really wanted to ask him was, he recently said his
   supporters are so devoted to him he could go in the middle of Fifth
   Avenue and shoot someone and he wouldn’t lose a single voter. In
   response to which I want to ask him, ‘Were you talking about me?'”
   Kelly said with a smile. “I never go there anymore.”

   Kelly has emerged as one of the lead characters in the country’s most
   watched TV series, The [48]GOP Debates, after she was cited by
   Republican front-runner Trump as being among [49]Donald Trump
   MegynKelly 2-shot the reasons [50]he boycotted FNC’s recent debate on
   the eve of Iowa caucuses. It’s a move Trump later said may have cost
   him the win among GOP hopefuls in that state. Trump had a run in with
   Kelly at the first GOP debate of this election cycle, in August, when
   she opened with a question to Trump: “You’ve called women you don’t
   like ‘fat pigs,’ ‘dogs,’ ‘’slobs’ and ‘disgusting animals’. Does that
   sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as
   president? And how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton, who
   is likely to be the Democratic nominee, that you are part of the war on
   women?”

   Trump subsequently said of Kelly’s question-asking:  “You could see
   there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of
   her — wherever.” That debate exchange, and his subsequent comments,
   turned the FNC primetime star into a household name, and a Vanity Fair
   cover – which Colbert held up once or twice during his interview
   tonight.

   When Kelly moderates the next GOP debate, which Donald Trump has said
   he will attend, her first question should be: “Mr. Trump: Boo!” Colbert
   suggested. Kelly had her own thoughts on that.

   “I’m going to start with ‘Apology accepted,'” Kelly said.

   Our money’s on Trump having something to say about that on Twitter at
   the crack of dawn Monday morning.

   “And then we’re going to have at it, like we’ve had at it with all the
   other guys – and Carly – up there,” Kelly said. She and GOP candidate
   Carly Fiorina appear to be on a first-name basis.

   Colbert wondered how the elected officials who’ve done time at GOP
   debates kids tables feel about having “Donald Trump the lead guy at the
   Big Boy’s table” at virtually every debate since the White House race
   began.

   “Trump has electrified the Republican base,” Kelly acknowledged.

   Colbert’s Late Show tonight is live, as is Kelly’s primetime show every
   weeknight.  “I love it. I think it adds a lot to the show,” Kelly said.
   “If you’re not live at 9, because the shows around me are taped, you
   lose a lot.”

   Bill O’Reilly and Sean Hannity, between whose programs Kelly’s is
   sandwiched on FNC’s schedule, are “phoning it in,” Colbert said,
   throwing Kelly an opening.

   “Let’s just say they tape earlier in the day, which is an advantage to
   us,” Kelly replied, smiling again.

   “Wow,” Colbert responded, as his studio audience made surprised noises
   too.

   [53]Trump’s least favorite debate moderator was a later booking for
   Colbert’s post-[54]Super Bowl broadcast. She joined Whiskey Tango
   Foxtrot stars Tina Fey and Margot Robbie, Zoolander 2’s Will Ferrell,
   and Colbert’s former Comedy Central colleagues Keegan-Michael Key and
   Jordan Peele, who are starring together in Keanu,  as Colbert’s show
   makes TV history in becoming the first late-night series to snag a live
   post-Super Bowl broadcast.

       Megyn Kelly is as much a journalist as Lois Lane, Brenda Starr,
       Miss Polly Purebred, Ted Baxter and Ron Burgundy.

       FOX should stop degrading the political process. It was obvious to
       anyone who watched her argumentative, finger pointing, towards
       Mr.Trump (during their combative confrontation) that she hates him.
       She PERSONALLY attacked him. Not on political substance, but
       personally. It is now FOX’S responsibility to excuse HER from these
       amateurish “anti-debates”, and allow the voting public to hear an
       honest “debate” about real issues effecting ths country.
       I’m neither a conservative, nor a liberal. I’d appreciate the
       opportunity to hear some real substance before I decide how to
       vote. This FOX fiasco has proven that they should not be involved
       in the “debates”.

            Jason … I am not a trump supporter, but using your logic about
            personal attacks shouldn’t trump also not be involved?
               o Jason • on Feb 8, 2016 3:50 pm
                 Jeff, Donald Trump is running for president. It is our
                 obligation to decide if he is the person who can do the
                 job, not the ‘moderators’ of the debates. It is their job
                 to be impartial. On the “semi-debate” in question, Mr.
                 Trump was singled out and systematically attacked by
                 Ms.Kelly. If the voting public finds his response
                 offensive, or not fitting of a president, he won’t win
                 the nomination. However, I think that most of his
                 supporters understand why he responded as he did, and
                 obviously, it didn’t bother them.
                 Had it been a man who personally attacked him, I
                 guarantee you he would have ripped the host a new one!
                 She’s playing the gender card, and it’s getting rather
                 old. If she simply would ask the participants questions
                 that the American people need answers to, and stick to
                 issues of political significance, she might be viewed as
                 a little more professional.
                 Like I said, I just want to hear answers to THE issues
                 most relevant to our country. We don’t need any of the
                 moderators, of the semi-debate, to create topics that no
                 one cares about. The moderators agenda should be neutral.
                 Anything other than neutrality and they appear to come
                 across biased — as Ms.Kelly has.
                 All things being equal — and, regardless of who’s
                 nominated in either party….we are in big trouble.

                      Gender issues – contraception, abortion, equal pay
                      etc. are very political these days so it’s entirely
                      appropriate to ask a man known for only being
                      interested in the young and hot (creepily including
                      his own daughter) as evidenced by three wives. His
                      “must be on her period” response proves the
                      legitimacy of the MK’s questioning.

            any newsman would and should if they had the backbone to do
            it. Too bad Megyn has bigger “balls” than the rest of the news
            staff on Fox! To think that she wouldn’t be offended by such a
            base comment is ludicrous.

       Kelly & Trump are two sides of the same coin. They both spread hate
       to win appeal. However, Trump has more integrity. He’s honest about
       who he is. Kelly, on the other hand, is pretends to be an impartial
       journalist but has a legacy polluted by her awful race baiting
       reports.

            whatever big announcement he was going to make? There was
            nothing to find out except the President was born in Hawaii to
            an American citizen. Trump has no integrity.

            the varsity athlete had that mysterious foot injury and got
            his medical deferment to avoid serving in Vietnam. Then even
            more integrity was called on when he called those who did
            serve and were captured “losers.” How does anyone cast a vote
            for that?

                      Difference there, integrity-wise, is Ali (then
                      Cassius Clay) was a conscientious objector. He knew
                      that there would be consequences for his actions and
                      he still stood by his decision. Trump was a weaselly
                      little snot who claimed to have a boo-boo to get out
                      of service and now has the unmitigated gall to

       of people that reads the National Enquire and believe it.
       Stick to the real issues. This is a campaign for the POTUS not one
       for your ratings. Your advertisers are foolish to think they are

       Megan kelly was loaded for bear from the start of the first debate.
       Obvious she treated mr trump with disdain. She is snarky and has a
       very high opinion of herself in my personal opinion. Rather than
       moderating the news with her own opinions, fox should consider her
       for a new show where her looks and snarky approach would be better
       suited to her. She forgets viewers are looking for new facts with
       which they can form their own opinions and not tolerate hers or her
       behavior. Fox’s response to the mess was also snarky and
       opinionated.

       Does Trump have people out there on his defensive team commenting
       on stories such as this???…because this is clearly a Megyn Kelly
       bash. Megyn clearly had a point when asking him about his “name
       calling”! Trump lashes back at anyone he comes in conflict with in
       a derogatory manner. It’s Never His Fault…it’s their fault you
       moron. If he were to become President how is he going to
       respond/act to the many put downs he will receive from other
       political figures? Is he going to call them names like he does now?
       Is he going to start a war with them? How can anyone want Trump to
       represent the USA with his boorishness and childish ways?

       Stop attacking Megyn! She’s white–and that’s a verifiable fact! ;-)

            She’s white that is verifiable-What’s the point!!!!

                 It’s a reference to his infamous comment that Santa Claus
                 is white–“and that’s a verifiable fact!”–as if he were a
                 real person. She even apologized to children who may have
                 been watching, as if any children anywhere would be
                 watching Fox News.

                      You do realize Santa Claus is based on a real
                      person, right?
                         @ cadavra • on Feb 8, 2016 9:57 pm
                           Um, no. There was a Saint Nicholas, but he was
                           Greek with dark skin (and also very skinny).
                           Santa as we know him today is a blend of two
                           fictional characters, the Dutch “Sinterklass”
                           and England’s “Father Christmas.” The image of
                           the jolly fat man with the big white beard
                           comes from Thomas Nast, who drew it to
                           accompany the original printing of “The Night
                           Before Christmas.” Santa is about as “real” as
                           the Tooth Fairy.
                           BTW, Jesus wasn’t a blue-eyed blonde, either,
                           though Kelly insisted on that as well. But at
                           least he was a real person.

       Megyn Kelly it would be nice if you started off being a responsible
       moderator and letting this go in a mature manner. Is this really so
       hard to do???

       Megyn, you need to move to Hollywood before it is too late
       (age-wise). Trump doesn’t owe you an apology and FOX shouldn’t let
       you even ask him a question. #DonaldTrumpForPresident
          + Mark • on Feb 8, 2016 6:12 pm
            After some of the comments Trump made about her, he most
            certainly does owe her an apology. But I doubt that will ever
            happen, seeing as he clearly never learned how to apologize
            when he is wrong about something.
   25. Leslee • on Feb 10, 2016 8:35 am
       I have watched every GOP Debate, and enjoy them very much. However,
       I do think it is an absolute shame that Donald Trump did not attend
       the last debate because of Megyn Kelly; and feel that during the
       first debate Kelly did in fact attack Trump, and did not do this to
       any other canidate. So he shot back to defend himself; Kelly needed
       to take the heat, and Fox news needed to stay out of it. If she is
       such a great journalist, then she needed to put her big girl
       panties on and deal with the situation herself. But, instead of
       handling this in a professional way, she just kept bringing the
       Debate and Trumps Tweets up over again and again. So, hopefully if
       the situation ever happens again, Kelly will keep it professional
       and not try to be nasty and attack him personally, in no other
       Debate has this happened. And, also if it does Fox News will let
       her deal with it herself, instead of backing her when she was
       wrong; when they did that, people lost some respect for the
       Network.
