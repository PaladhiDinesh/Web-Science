[49]Former Mexican President Says Country Not Paying for a Stupid, Useless
Wall

   For the past several months, GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump
   has taken a harsh stance on immigration, stating more than once that he
   would finish the wall between the U.S. and Mexico and ensure that
   [55]Mexico pays for it.

   For the first time, [56]according to NBC News, a Mexican official has
   pushed back. Over the weekend, at a business summit in Egypt, former
   Mexican President Felipe Calderon (2006-2012) said, “We are not going
   to pay any single cent for such a stupid wall! And it’s going to be
   completely useless.”

   Calderon noted the drop in net migration from Mexico, which according
   to the Pew Research Center has been [57]on the decline for years. The
   number of Mexicans coming to the United States each year is now
   [58]lower than the number leaving. However, the other critical point
   Calderon made was that sealing yourself off from one of your largest
   trading partners is bad for business. Calderon said:

     “The first loser of such a policy would be the United States. If
     this guy pretends that closing the borders to anywhere either for
     trade [or] for people is going to provide prosperity to the United
     States, he is completely crazy.”

   Calderon makes an important point. Mexico is the United States’ third
   largest trading partner, after Canada and China, in terms of total
   trade in goods, while the U.S. is Mexico’s largest trading partner. It
   seems a bad policy position coming from Trump, who prides himself on
   his business acumen.

   the United States

   Consider this. In calendar year 2011, the two nations had a total trade
   in goods of [60]$460.6 billion and, in 2012, the total amount of goods
   traded was [61]$494 billion. Combined, trade in goods and services
   between Mexico and the United States totaled more than [62]$500 billion
   in 2011. And in 2012, that number was up to [63]$535.9 billion. As
   such, six million American jobs depend upon the U.S. trade relationship
   with Mexico. Also in 2012, in terms of imports, Mexico was the United
   States third largest supplier of goods, with the U.S. receiving
   [64]$277.7 billion worth of goods from Mexico.

   Rather than building a wall, perhaps the billionaire businessman should
   focus on policies that improve the flow of trade between the two
   countries by devising plans to upgrade the 47 land ports of entry which
   facilitate hundreds of billions of dollars in U.S.-Mexico trade every
   year. Things like improved infrastructure at the land ports of entry
   along the southern border, including additional traffic lanes and
   processing personnel, would allow more efficient and secure trade and
   border crossing. These improvements translate into direct economic
   benefits to border communities and states.

   Sensible and practical policies that ensure security, but also improve
   trade, may not make for exciting political slogans or talking points.
   They’re just good for the economy.

       Very interesting. However, if Calderon is the “former” president,
       simply put: he has no legal authority ANY LONGER. The argument can
       also go the other way: Trump is not – AS YET – president of the USA
       and his persuasion is not binding.
