Elevate your next Subway sandwich with the great taste of yakisoba

   Our reporter Meg ventures waist-deep in carbs to discover a new way to
   enjoy Subway — and she may never turn back.

   Even in Japan, the global sub chain Subway markets itself as a more
   health-conscious alternative to fast food. So, it was with a small pang
   of guilt that Meg constructed Kyukyoku no Yakisoba Pan (Ultimate
   Yakisoba Bread) using the delectably greasy fried noodles of yakisoba.

   Yakisoba in sandwich form isn’t anything new, and can easily be found
   in most convenience stores and supermarkets. Known more as a cheap and
   tasty snack, it is hardly considered healthy eating.

   Nevertheless, a while back, there was an April Fools joke going around
   that Subway was going to sell yakisoba sandwiches. The store denied the
   report, however, implying that it would never stoop so low health-wise.

   Meg, however, certainly would.

   Construction of the Ultimate Yakisoba Bread was simple enough. Meg
   first purchased a 6-inch Veggie Delight sub from Subway without
   dressing. Then she bought a pack of pre-made yakisoba and proceeded to
   stuff the noodles into the opened Veggie Delight.

   If looks alone were anything to go by this was shaping up to be an
   excellent sandwich, but, of course, Meg would have to go in for a
   taste.

   And it tasted even better than she expected! As we said before,
   yakisoba sandwiches are not new, but the Ultimate Yakisoba Bread
   clearly stood out as a superior sandwich.

   Usually when eating yakisoba with bread, it creates a dry sensation
   inside your mouth. And the occasional scrap of soggy cabbage does
   little to relieve this feeling. The Ultimate Yakisoba Bread, however,
   uses the very fresh and plentiful vegetables from Subway to completely
   eliminate that unpleasant dry feeling for a highly enjoyable eating
   experience.

   Meg would like to remind everyone that this isn’t an officially
   sanctioned Subway sandwich…but it should be added to their menu because
   it’s pretty awesome. Even if it does go against their healthy eating
   image, the taste is so good she thinks the general public would be
   willing to look the other way this one time.
