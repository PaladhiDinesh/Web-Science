Donald Trump: Jeb Bush ‘Total Stiff,’ ‘Like A Spoiled Child’

   Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks to a small crowd

   Hampshire. Trump, who came in second place in Iowa despite leading in

GOP frontrunner Donald Trump took questions for nearly an hour from voters in
Salem, New Hampshire on Monday morning, saying, “We have to get rid [of] the
Bushs of the world,” and calling former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush a “total
stiff.”

   “We have to get rid of the Bush’s [of] the world…guys like that will
   never straighten out the country,” Trump charged.

   Trump also said that the other GOP candidates have “good talent,” but
   not Bush, who Trump called a “total stiff.”

   “He’s like a spoiled child,” Trump jabbed. “I like a few of them. I
   think a few of them have good talent,” the real estate mogul said of
   his competitors. “I don’t have a lot of respect for Jeb.”

   Trump was asked how he will fight government corruption by a
   supporter who was holding the book [27]“Clinton Cash” by Breitbart
   News’ editor-at-large Peter Schweizer. The book highlights financial
   connections between foreign governments and the Clinton Foundation.

   “I’m not bought and paid for,” Trump responded. “I contributed to
   everybody,” he added. “I understand the system.”

   “We have to do something about it,” he charged.

   “It’s an honor to be doing what I’m doing,” Trump told his supporters,
   about funding his own campaign and not being “bought and paid for.”

   “You have to go out and vote tomorrow…you have to do it,” he reminded
   them, adding he isn’t asking for their money, just their vote.

   Trump was told by two of his supporters they would vote ten times for
   him if they could.

   Trump joked that there are a lot of places in this country where people
   vote ten times. He mocked the opposition of voter ID laws. “If I get
   the nomination, I’m going to fight like hell to make sure I don’t have
   some person that isn’t even a resident in this country [voting],” he
   pledged.

   “We have a movement going on. We’re going to take back our country,”
   Trump proclaimed.

   Moments after leaving his event in Salem, New Hampshire, Trump posted
   on Twitter again slamming Bush:

     Jeb Bush is desperate – strongly in favor of [28]#CommonCore and
     very weak on illegal immigration.

     — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) [29]February 8, 2016

     Jeb Bush has zero communication skills so he spent a fortune of
     special interest money on a Super Bowl ad. He is a weak candidate!

     — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) [30]February 8, 2016
