   A British woman believed to be linked to a paedophile ring for sex
   tourists in the Philippines is on the run from police after abused
   children as young as six months old were found living in squalor in her
   home.

   Lilian May Thomson, 66, has fled her remote rural home in Subic Bay,
   and is suspected of escaping overseas using a second passport or hiding
   in the Philippines despite warrants for her arrest.

   Now child protection campaigners have called for an international
   search for Thomson who they believe may have vital evidence about a
   major paedophile ring that peddles children for sex tourists in the
   sleazy Barrio Barretto red light area of Olongapo in Subic Bay.

   Scottish-born Thomson, dubbed the 'world's worst foster mother by
   investigators', was arrested in July 2014 when law officers and social
   workers went to her ramshackle tin-roofed home in remote countryside
   and found five Filipino children, including a malnourished baby boy
   aged six months and a girl of seven who was kept tied to a chair.

   Hard-drinking Thomson – who has several aliases and is known locally as
   Sherry Zimmer – allegedly hurled abuse at the investigators,
   threatening them, and bizarrely threw a ceremonial spear at them after
   grabbing the half-naked children and shutting herself inside the house.

   The children were taken to hospital where examinations concluded two
   girls aged seven, a girl aged six and a boy aged seven had all suffered
   sexual abuse.

   The boy later told how a male visitor to the house sexually abused him
   and took naked photographs of him.

   In interviews with psychologists, the girls – who like the other
   children appear to have been allowed to live with Thomson by
   poverty-stricken local families – described being taken to parties in
   Barrio Barretto where they say they were molested by men they called
   ‘uncle’.

   Despite the children’s evidence, Thomson was cleared of charges of
   child abuse and illegal detention and released in the middle of 2015
   after spending almost a year in custody.

   She was cleared after her defence lawyers argued her home was raided
   without a search warrant and evidence of abuse such as the girl found
   tied to the chair was not admissible because of the 'unlawful entry' by
   the officials.

   Her lawyers interviewed the children’s parents who later gave
   statements claiming they gave their permission for their children to
   live with Thomson and that they were treated well by her and not
   illegally detained.

   Police attempted to re-arrest her on two warrants for assaulting
   officers but have been unable to trace her. Court officials in nearby
   Olongapo confirmed Thomson was now considered a fugitive and would be
   arrested on sight.

   MailOnline visited Thomson’s home and found it abandoned with rows of
   empty brandy bottles outside and a sign next to the back door
   apparently directed at the children in her care reads: 'No Whining'.
   Thomson’s abandoned car was parked outside and had been stripped.

   Two local families said they had been hired to guard the property but
   knew nothing of Thomson’s whereabouts.

   'We thought she was still in jail,' one woman said. 'We have been asked
   to guard the house until she gets out.'

   Thomson, a mother of two, is originally from Dunfermline in Scotland
   and lived in the US for some years and has both American and British
   passports.

   She appears to have had a succession of young children and babies
   living with her since moving to the Philippines in 2001.

   She claimed she decided to set up a children’s charity called the Scott
   Foundation to care for underprivileged children in the Philippines
   after the death of her younger son, but the foundation is unregistered
   and Thomson has no childcare qualifications.

   Her arrest came after the three children, one of them half-naked,
   wandered into a girls’ home near Thomson’s house, run by children’s
   charity, the Preda Foundation, in July 2014.

   A Preda therapist spoke to the two girls and was shocked to discover
   they did not know their real names and only knew their nicknames.

   They also had no idea why they were being kept at Thomson’s house and
   how long they had been there.

   Preda alerted social welfare and National Bureau of Investigation
   officers who then raided the house and removed the five children
   inside. All five of the children are currently still in care.

   Father Shay Cullen, a Catholic missionary who started the Preda
   Foundation to fight child sex abuse and exploitation more than 40 years
   ago, said he believed Thomson may have knowingly or unknowingly been
   manipulated by a paedophile ring.

   'The little boy testified very clearly using anatomical dolls that a
   man took pictures of him naked in the shower and abused him,' he said.
   'The abuse of children by sex tourists is a huge industry and she is
   the key to finding the big players involved in this.'

   Father Shay said he hoped international law enforcement agencies would
   help re-arrest Thomson if she had fled the Philippines so that any link
   with a paedophile ring could be properly investigated.

   Thomson was made to surrender her U.S. passport after her arrest but
   may have left the Philippines using her British passport, he suggested.

   He added: 'The children in this case have suffered terribly but they
   have not had any justice yet and that is what we want to see.'

   Barrio Barretto in Subic Bay, where the U.S. once had a major naval
   base, is notorious for underage prostitution and has dozens of mostly
   American-owned bars popular with western sex tourists.

   International children’s charity UNICEF estimates that 100,000 children
   a year, mostly from poor families, are forced into the sex industry in
   southeast Asia.

       moving in a gender-equal world¿I had a sense of it, but I didn¿t
       start to really see evidence of it, I think, until I hit puberty.
       Media even before that age is already creating all these biases.
       \nDAVIS: And it¿s like, is this not the 21st century? I mean,
       really? But that isn¿t what made me do the research. I just started
       asking my friends if they had noticed. None of them¿feminists,
       mothers, daughters¿noticed until I pointed it out. Then I decided
       to bring it up within the industry. I knew a lot of people, so I¿d
       say, ¿Have you ever noticed how few female characters there are in
       kids movies?¿ when I met a director, a producer, whatever. And they
       said, ¿Oh, but that¿s not true anymore.¿ Then they would name a
       movie with one female character as the proof that things had
       changed. [Watson laughs] My point was the world is missing female
       characters. A lot of times 'I have so much experience!' Geena Davis
