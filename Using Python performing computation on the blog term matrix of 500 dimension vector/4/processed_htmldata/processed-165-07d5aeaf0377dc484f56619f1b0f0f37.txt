A Lovely Map of Phone Reception in the New York Subway

   Its creators probed the MTA’s 660 miles of track with a prototype data
   logger.

   A quintessential [25]New York experience—maybe even more than eating a
   lox bagel or being ignored by an outer borough-hating taxi—is entering
   the subway and having your phone reception promptly drop into a black
   hole.

   Yes, this most advanced of cities has extremely sucky train coverage.
   And while the MTA is [26]somewhere in the middle phase of wiring 279
   below-ground stations, there are still places you can’t make a call to
   save your life.

   These coverage deserts and rare oases are the subject of a fascinating
   new endeavor from [27]Daniel Goddemeyer and [28]Dominikus Baur, who’ve
   made an [29]iPhone app and [30]MTA-licensed posters illustrating the
   unequal geography of subway reception. “The Subspotting project
   captures, maps, and visualizes the available cell phone reception along
   all 21 lines, 469 stations, and 660 miles of track of the New York City
   Subway,” they write in a [31]press release. “It is the first project of
   its kind to capture the cell phone reception in the entire subway
   system to provide New Yorkers … with information on where to make the
   next call or send the next text while underground.”
   [32]Subspotting

   The project got started when Goddemeyer, a researcher and designer at
   Brooklyn’s [33]Object Form Field Culture, noticed on his uptown commute
   little areas of connectivity that allowed him to finish emails
   underground. That led to an extensive poking-around of the train
   system, in which the Subspotting team used a prototype data logger to
   detect levels of reception for Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint.

   The resulting app shows the quality of reception at stations on your
   line as different-sized bars. It also pinpoints places with wi-fi and
   colors blue stretches of track that are above ground. You can now use
   it (or the $40 posters) to plan where you’ll be able to call work, and
   roughly how much time you’ll have to tell the boss why another MTA
   delay is making you late.

   In their expeditions, the Subspotting folks found the 7 and J lines had
   the most coverage along their complete length (at 79 and 75 percent,
   respectively), while the G—doomed to be abysmal at everything—had the
   least at 12 percent. Here are some other fun things they discovered:

     Lots of spotty signals – The 1 train

     Spotty reception most of the way from South Ferry to 125th Street,
     due to stray signals from above ground.

     Communication breakdown – The R train

     Be prepared for some radio silence when heading into Brooklyn—you
     will find almost no reception over there.

     Send it while you can – The L train

     Make the most of the strong pockets of reception at 8th Ave and 6th
     Ave—no service again before Wilson Ave when heading east.

     Connection with a view – The Q train

     Send your messages while crossing the Manhattan Bridge, one of the
     few well-connected spots on the Q (and, you get a nice view!).

   One type of Subspotting poster. A selection from another poster showing
   linear comparisons of the different lines. ([34]Subspotting)
