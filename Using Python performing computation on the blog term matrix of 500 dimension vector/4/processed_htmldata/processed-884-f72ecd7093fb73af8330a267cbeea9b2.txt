The world’s most hated company: can NGOs help turn Shell’s reputation around?

   The oil giant has topped the list of most criticized brands for the
   fourth year running. But should NGOs be doing more to push the carbon
   fuel debate forward?

   In mid-2015, Shell realized its project in the Chuckchi Sea, off the
   coast of Alaska, was in trouble. After nearly a decade of expensive
   drilling, it still hadn’t yielded results and increasingly strict
   regulations were making it harder to operate. Plus, there was the small
   issue of public opinion, which, [52]inspired by an aggressive campaign
   by Greenpeace, was turning against the company.

   Greenpeace started protesting the Chukchi Sea project in 2012, when[53]
   activists occupied a Shell-contracted drillship headed for the Arctic.
   A couple of years later,[54] climbers rappelled off a bridge in
   Portland, Oregon, to block an icebreaker vessel from leaving the port.
   And, in September 2015, it[55] staged a weeks-long protest outside
   Shell’s headquarters in London, erecting a giant animatronic polar bear
   and enlisting the support of British actress Emma Thompson. Later that
   month, Shell gave up on its arctic dreams altogether, [56]announcing it
   was ending the $7bn-effort.

   Shell claimed the project[58] was scuttled by poor results and an
   unpredictable regulatory environment. But Tensie Whelan, director of
   New York University’s new Center for Sustainable Business, said that a
   major cause was the pressure from Greenpeace and other activist groups.
   “The scrutiny of the Greenpeace campaign absolutely led to huge
   regulatory changes,” she said.

   The [59]Greenpeace campaign illustrates a larger trend: in recent
   years, NGO criticism – and praise – has had a measurable effect on
   corporate reputations and profits. Last month, Sigwatch, a consultancy
   that tracks campaigns by more than 7,500 NGOs, released its annual list
   of the companies most praised and most criticized by NGOs. For the
   fourth year running, Shell topped the most criticized list; according
   to the report, the drilling program was largely to blame.

   Five of the 10 most criticized firms were energy companies, a trend
   that has held steady since Sigwatch first compiled the list in 2010. At
   the heart of this lies a fundamental conflict: environmental groups and
   activists want fossil fuels to remain in the ground in order to avert
   catastrophic climate change, but extracting oil and gas is the core of
   these companies’ business.

   “The reason why oil companies aren’t praised is that they are beyond
   the pale,” said Robert Blood, founder and managing director at
   Sigwatch. “The NGOs’ view is that as long as oil and gas companies fail
   to acknowledge in their business models that carbon fuels are on the
   way out, and the only question is how long it will take – there is
   little point even talking to them, let alone praising them.”

   According to Blood, this is unfortunate, because the world will
   continue to use oil for many years to come. During that time, drilling
   still has to be conducted in a safe and considerate manner. “This is an
   area where NGOs can help enormously with technical advice and working
   with oil companies to raise standards, but it’s no longer happening
   because of this impasse,” he added.

Surprising winners and losers

   For the second year in a row, Nestlé was the world’s most praised
   company on Sigwatch’s list. NGOs honored the food and beverage company
   for its efforts in tackling climate change, its commitment to zero
   deforestation, and its efforts to clean up its supply chain. Nestlé was
   recently hailed[60] as a “game-changer” for its voluntary admission to
   slavery in its supply chain in Thailand.

   Other highly-praised companies were more of a surprise. McDonald’s –
   which topped the North American list and was ranked number three
   globally – did not even make the top 20 in 2014. According to the
   report, the fast food chain was commended for a number of recent
   changes to its operations, such as[61] a reduction in its antibiotic
   usage, its decision to raise pay for its hourly workers and attempts to
   improve animal welfare.

   But the company’s most notable move was its September announcement that
   it would[62] phase out the use of eggs from hens housed in cages during
   the next decade. Given that[63] McDonald’s purchases 2bn eggs annually
   in the US for use in its breakfast items, this was a huge victory for
   the NGOs – particularly Mercy For Animals – that had been pressuring
   the fast food giant to make the switch. In 2012, [64]hidden camera
   footage was released from Sparboe Egg Farm – one of the McDonald’s
   suppliers – showing hens crammed into filthy wire cages, decomposing
   hens lying on the floor among live birds laying eggs destined for
   grocery shelves, and chicks being suffocated in plastic bags.

The bottom line

   Shell, on the other hand, is experiencing the reverse: on Thursday, the
   company announced[66] an 87% decline in annual profits. While Shell’s
   plummeting profits are partially due to the falling price of oil, the
   years of negative publicity surrounding the company have likely also
   had an effect, said Whelan. “A company that is making decisions in a
   way that flies in the face of public benefits and concerns, and does
   that consistently for a long period will pay the price,” she added.

   Companies that willfully deceive the public are particularly
   vulnerable, said Annie Leonard, executive director of Greenpeace USA.
   Volkswagen – which had never been on Sigwatch’s most criticized list –
   made it all the way to seventh place after it [67]rigged its cars to
   cheat on emission standards.

   Oil company ExxonMobil also discovered the cost of dishonesty: it was
   ranked 2015’s fifth most-criticized company following[68] a public
   scandal when it was exposed for misleading investors and consumers
   about the effects of climate change. “I’d say the corporations that
   generate the most ire are ones that not only pollute ... but that
   proactively engage in untruthful behavior to further their polluting
   practices,” said Leonard.

   According to Sigwatch, size is another major factor. The 10 biggest
   companies by market share in every sector, except finance, attracted
   50-70% of NGO attention. This has a lot to do with efficiency: NGOs
   tend to have limited resources, so it makes sense to target the bigger
   companies. Once one notable player is called out for wrongdoing and
   makes a change, others tend to follow.

   “With social media, environmental and social issues are really coming
   to the fore,” said Whelan. “If one company makes a major change and
   gets publicity for it, the others can’t just stand still while their
   competitor is moving forward.”

   Technology has made it possible for the public to get more directly
   involved, enabling anyone with a computer and internet connection to
   run a campaign “for pennies”, according to Greenpeace’s Leonard.

   For example, a recent rap video that urged Unilever to clean up alleged
   mercury pollution in southeast India was put together by activists and
   ex-workers. The video,[69] which was shot on a shoestring budget in one
   day, has gone viral, attracting more than 3m views on YouTube. The
   campaign led Unilever to defend itself on Twitter, saying it was
   “determined to solve” the issue that allegedly left over 1,000 workers
   from a former thermometer factory owned by Hindustan Unilever with
   mercury poisoning.

   “A creative website, homemade video, or online petition can all go
   viral, garner attention via earned media rather than paid, and have a
   big impact,” Leonard said.

   In other words, the tools for influencing corporations, NGOs and
   businesses are increasingly in our hands.
