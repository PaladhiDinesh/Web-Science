Global Supply Chain Report 2016


Following a global deal at COP21, the UN climate conference, companies and
their suppliers must mobilize towards a climate resilient world.

This is a decisive time for the Earth’s climate and for the global economy.
The COP21 Paris Agreement requires global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to
reduce to net zero well before the end of the century. With supply chains
responsible for up to four times the GHGs of a company’s direct operations,
they house sizable regulatory risk but also present ample opportunity for
businesses to lower emissions.

Mobilizing suppliers towards low carbon

   Watch our video to understand how our program can help you and your
   suppliers achieve climate resilience.

Disclosure works...

38%

in year one

   Of suppliers diclosing for the first time 38% are working to reduce
   their emissions.

48%

in year two

   When suppliers disclose for two years in a row the percentage reducing
   emissions increases.

69%

in year three

   The majority of suppliers disclosing for three years or more are
   actively lowering emissions.

Achieving climate neutrality is no longer theoretical, but now possible.
Everyone is under starter’s orders, including multinational organizations and
their worldwide supply base.

Christiana Figueres,
Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC.
