Sen. John McCain's criticism of Donald Trump earned praise from the Obama
administration. (Washington Examiner photos)

Obama, McCain team up against Trump on waterboarding

   A top Senate Republican slammed Donald Trump's stance on waterboarding
   on Monday, an action that promptly received an expression of gratitude
   from the White House.

   "It is … important to remember that our nation has tried, convicted,
   and executed foreign combatants who employed methods of torture,
   including waterboarding, against American prisoners of war," Senate
   Armed Services Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., said in a statement. "As
   I have said before, our nation should never have employed such
   practices in the past, and we should never permit them in the future."

   "Our nation needs a Commander-in-Chief who will make clear to those
   that fight on our behalf that they are defending this sacred ideal, and
   that sacrificing our respect for human dignity will make it harder, not
   easier, to prevail in this war," McCain added. McCain, a Vietnam
   veteran, spent six years as a prisoner of war and was repeatedly
   tortured.

     McDonough (@Denis44) [200]February 8, 2016

   Trump has been under fire since a Republican presidential debate held
   on Saturday in which he said waterboarding did not constitute torture
   and that he would support bringing it back.

   "Under the definition of torture, no, it's not. It is enhanced
   interrogation ... It does not meet the generally recognized definition
   of torture," Trump said. He added that he would "bring back a hell of a
   lot worse than waterboarding."
