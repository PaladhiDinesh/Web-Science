   The Donald’s whoppers have turned the media focus from gaffes—the fuel
   of election coverage past—to lies. Michael Kinsley applauds—but wonders
   if it will matter.
   by
     * [20]Michael Kinsley

   Ann Romney gave the game away four years ago. Not that it was any
   secret, but the wife of the Republican presidential contender in 2012
   spelled it all out in a way that should have been embarrassing to
   everyone involved in politics.

   A Democratic political operative named Hilary Rosen had commented
   publicly in a CNN interview with Anderson Cooper that Ann Romney “never
   worked a day in her life.” This overlooked the fact that, as a
   homemaker, Romney had successfully raised five nearly identical,
   Wasp-perfect sons. Five out of five—it almost defies the laws of
   physics. Republicans leapt on Rosen’s remark as an insult to women who
   had chosen to stay home and raise a family rather than pursue a career
   in the workforce. This is a substantial bloc of voters, especially in
   the Republican Party. It was Ann Romney’s role in this staged melodrama
   to be deeply offended and hurt by Rosen’s remark. But she missed her
   cue and instead she called Rosen’s comment an “early birthday present.”

   This was a “gaffe”—a word that barely exists outside the world of
   politics but has come to be the principal mechanism by which
   politicians and the press keep things moving along. Hilary Rosen’s
   comment, which led to Ann Romney’s comment, was also a gaffe. As we all
   know, a gaffe is when a politician tells the truth. (“If I hear that
   line one more time, I’ll scream,” says Arianna. A pause. “Darling,” she
   adds.) Or, more subtly, a gaffe occurs when a politician or someone in
   the political world departs from the script and accidentally says
   what’s really on his or her mind. Ann Romney revealed that she was not
   hurt or distressed but delighted that a prominent Democrat had
   committed a gaffe. A feigned dynamic is central to the gaffe-o-rama
   that American politics has become—which in turn plays to the growing
   role of umbrage in many corners of American culture.

   A variant on outright umbrage is the “sorrow, not anger” ploy—the
   pretense that the supposed victim of a gaffe is not enraged but deeply
   saddened. “Saddened” suggests a certain dignity and seriousness: You
   are far too big a person to take offense at your opponent’s offensive
   remark. You are just saddened that his or her pathetic insensitivity
   should drive him or her to such depths of depravity and gaffery.

   This election season, a rival has arisen to challenge the gaffe as the
   essential fuel that keeps politics chugging along. It’s known as the
   lie. A “lie” is a much more straightforward matter than a gaffe. In
   recent elections, gaffes have been given far more attention than lies:
   John Kerry saying he was for the Iraq war before he was against it;
   Mitt Romney effectively defining 47 percent of the electorate as
   freeloaders. But in the past year, “fact-checking,” which had begun to
   get real traction in 2008, has become all the rage among the media.
   This is an excellent development, which I am not here to mock. But if I
   were here to mock it, I might point out the triviality or irrelevance
   of many lies that become issues in the campaign. Does it really matter
   whether Marco Rubio’s parents came to America in 1959 (fleeing Castro’s
   revolution in Cuba, as he claimed for years) or in 1956 (well before
   the revolution, as he eventually admitted)? Well, yes, it does matter,
   though only because if he lied about this, then it says something about
   his character. But does it say enough to justify the time taken away
   from discussion of what to do about Iranian nukes or income inequality?
   As coverage of campaign mechanics and trifling details becomes more
   pervasive, coverage of issues a president will actually have to deal
   with is crowded out. Publications such as Politico (confession: I used
   to work there; it’s a swell place) and an infinity of Web sites and
   cable-TV shows have all raised the importance of trivia.

   As gaffes recede in importance, the old-fashioned untruth is making a
   comeback. Something to celebrate?
   Illustration by Barry Blitt.

   So, the role of the gaffe is receding. The old-fashioned lie is making
   a comeback. Question for today: Is this a good thing or a bad thing?
   It’s actually a puzzle to me why anyone takes gaffes seriously at all.
   Why shouldn’t the words that a candidate has carefully crafted be
   considered a more accurate reflection of actual opinion and character
   than the words uttered by accident? This must arise from a belief that,
   while a lie is by definition purposeful, a gaffe has accidentally
   bubbled up from some unattractive (or incompetent) part of the
   speaker’s brain over which his campaign manager has no control.

   A deliberate lie is worse than an accidental gaffe. Lies by politicians
   are inevitable, and it has taken Donald Trump—with his claim that
   thousands of people in New Jersey (with its “heavy Arab population”)
   cheered the destruction of the Twin Towers; with his claim that 81
   percent of white murder victims are killed by blacks; and with a lot
   more—to push the American media to call a lie a lie when first
   reported, rather than let it sit there uncontested until the second
   wave, that of “analysis,” comes along. (“Analysis” is newspaper code
   for “this is the real skinny—just ignore all of our earlier stuff.”)
   But there are lies and then there are lies. Magazines have always had
   fact-checkers—overworked, underpaid, and often amazingly attractive
   (it’s best to stay on their good side)—who excel at finding mistakes by
   a writer before an article appears. But it isn’t even their job to
   correct deliberate lies by the subject of a piece.

   Any analysis of lying and its role in democracy must pause to consider
   what is probably the greatest lie ever to grace our politics: Bill
   Clinton’s magnificent “I did not have sexual relations with that
   woman,” of 1998. It’s worthy of study by anyone with political
   ambitions (though not just anyone could pull it off). This lie had
   everything. Above all, it was an actual attempt to mislead people on a
   concrete question of fact—and, for a time, it even worked. Most
   political lies are not intended to actually change anyone’s mind. It’s
   usually too late for that. Ordinary political lies are merely intended
   to sow confusion and sprinkle a bit of doubt. If lying politicians can
   supply a reed to their own supporters who are grasping for one, the job
   will have been done.

   A great political lie should not be complicated. Subject matter is
   important. A run-of-the-mill lie may concern itself with some minor or
   ancient indiscretion. A somewhat grander lie will be about a matter of
   policy, such as saying you have always supported Medicare when as a
   governor you opposed it. Taking the hard way—the eastern ascent of
   Everest—is what turns a good lie into a masterpiece. The subject will
   return from policy to the personal. At its best, it will involve
   sex—or, rather, as Clinton would have it, it will not involve sex.
   Or—and this is the truly glorious part of his lie—whether or not it
   involves sex will become the very issue. A great political lie, when it
   works, performs triple duty. It deceives people about the subject at
   hand. It deceives people about the character of the politician in
   question. And it provides a distraction.

   It is good to be focusing on lies again, because our next president
   will be a liar. How do I know? Every candidate who survives into
   election year is a proven liar. Maybe Lincoln Chafee or (is it
   possible?) Rick Perry has never told a conscious, knowing lie. Where
   are they now? But Hillary Clinton has, and so have all those
   Republicans, including, of course, Donald Trump. Still, I would rather
   have a congenital gaffer as president than a congenital liar. It would
   be nice not to have to make the choice.

   An Illustrated History of Donald Trump’s Hair. Warning! Don’t Read
   Before Lunch!

   donald trump history hair ss01

   In this photo from 1976, Trump shows off plans for the future Grand
   Hyatt on East 42nd Street to a city official. Considering the era and
   the man, this is a remarkably tasteful, organic-looking hairstyle.
   Nevertheless, the hard-charging young developer appears to be studying
   the older man’s pate-management techniques with an eye, as always, to
   the future.

   The year is 1985. Trump, pictured with his first wife, Ivana, is now
   parting his hair from left to right, as he does to this day (to the
   extent that the complex superstructure that is Trump’s hair can be said
   to have something as straightforward as a “part”). This is believed to
   be the last picture in which more than three-quarters of an inch of
   Trump’s forehead was exposed to public view.
   By Ron Galella/WireImage.

   Mr. and first-Mrs. Trump at the 1988 U.S. Open. Note that Ivana has
   essentially the same hairstyle as Donald, the rightward sweep of her
   hair echoing her husband’s, though Ivana’s tresses are clearly attached
   to her forehead in a way that lends all the more mystery and intrigue
   to his.
   By PL Gould/IMAGES/Getty Images.

   Trump at a circa 1990 event with Clive Davis, Rod Stewart, and Rachel
   Hunter. That is not a lobotomy scar on the side of the billionaire’s
   head but rather a severe and deep part that suggests a “problem area”
   on the top and back of his scalp is being compensated for. Note that
   this party picture is composed as meticulously as an allegoric
   Renaissance painting, with Trump occupying the symbolic middle ground,
   in terms of possessing active follicles, between Davis and Stewart. To
   the right, Hunter represents hair in its unfallen, natural-ish state.
   By L. Cohen/WireImage.

   Trump and then-girlfriend Marla Maples sanctifying their love, like all
   devoted couples do, at a press event in 1991. Note that Trump’s
   “hairline” is now nearly contiguous with his eyebrows. Is this evidence
   of the scalp reduction he allegedly underwent in 1989, according to
   divorce papers filed by Ivana and recounted in the 1993 biography Lost
   Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump?
   By Ron Galella/WireImage.
   donald trump history hair ss06

   Trump’s 1993 wedding to Maples, the second Mrs. Trump. Strangely, the
   hair on the left side of the groom’s head is a full half foot taller
   than on the right. This imbalance may be the result of the three or
   four inter-dimensional, gravity-warping vortexes clearly visible in the
   back of his head.

   Trump bending over to share a tender moment with his son Eric in 1991.
   This inadvertent overhead view reveals that, claims to Swedish ancestry
   notwithstanding, Trump is in fact part unicorn.

   Trump with the John F. Kennedy Jr. at a 1999 New York Knicks game.
   Observe how the businessman’s hair breaks over his collar like a
   viscous, bird-killing oil slick. Why is J.F.K. Jr. the one wearing a
   hat?
   By Keith Torrie/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images.
   donald trump history hair ss09

   Trump at an outdoor event in around 2000, after ordering his stylist to
   color his hair and eyebrows a then-chic shade known as
   “Cigar-Stained-Teeth Blonde.” Tellingly, the wind affects but a single
   quadrant of Trump’s hair, as if the rest were bolted down like a storm
   cellar door.
   By Budd Williams/NY Daily News Archive/Getty Images.
   donald trump history hair ss10

   In this 2002 photograph, Trump has changed his hair color to
   “Burnt-Cheetos Auburn.” As well, the conventional hairsprays and salon
   products of years past appear to have given way to rubber cement and
   snot.
   By Gary Friedman/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images.

   Unlike her husband, the third Mrs. Trump, Melania Knauss, is
   comfortable enough in her femininity to show off her normal but
   comparatively high hairline in this 2002 photo.

   Trump, shown here, in 2003, with Apprentice producer Mark Burnett,
   experiments with white roots and light filaments wrapped around the
   back of his head. Historians call this developer’s “middle-aged club
   kid” phase.
   By Jim Spellman/WireImage.

   Trump at the 2004 Emmys. At this point, we’re just fucking with your
   stomach. Had lunch yet?
   By Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic.

   Trump with son Donald Trump Jr. at a 2006 press event where they appear
   to be performers in a horrifying tableau vivant of The Picture of
   Dorian Gray. Skillful lighting reveals the father’s signature
   side-and-back comb-over (and over)—The Trump Crosshatch™—while the
   son’s mane has been styled to look genuinely, biologically luxuriant.
   By J. Kempin/FilmMagic.
   donald trump history hair ss15

   Trump, at a 2013 red-carpet event for All-Star Celebrity Apprentice, in
   disguise as former U.S. representative Dick Gephardt, possibly to avoid
   good-writing scolds who consider “All-Star Celebrity” redundant, and
   fact checkers who might deem the claim debatable.
   By Matthew Eisman/WireImage.
   donald trump history hair ss16

   Trump at Trump Tower this past June, announcing his candidacy for
   president. Cannily, he appears to be courting the women’s vote by
   having combed the hair on the left side of his head into the shape of a
   vagina.
