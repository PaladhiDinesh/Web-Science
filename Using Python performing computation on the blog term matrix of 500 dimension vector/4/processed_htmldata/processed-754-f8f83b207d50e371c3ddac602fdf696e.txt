Ban Donald Trump? You’ll Have To Ban Ex-Muslims, European Leaders, And Me As
Well

It was perhaps inevitable, when you note the wilful and lazy un[DEL: der
:DEL] reporting by Britain’s mainstream media of issues pertaining to radical
Islam, that when a vocal critic came along, people’s first instincts would be
to call him a “racist” and seek to curtail their own rights of free speech in
response. Turkeys voting for Christmas. Cutting off your nose to spite your
face. Choose whatever idiom you want… if the shoe fits… ahem.

   So when Suzanne Kelly – a [27]long-standing anti-Trump campaigner in
   Scotland – started a parliamentary petition, the media seized on it,
   failing to report that a) it was NOT in response to his comments about
   a moratorium on Muslim immigration to the U.S. and b) it was actually
   started BEFORE he even said anything of the sort.

   It was one socialist, who has been “investigating Trump’s activities
   and the objections of local residents to his golfing development for
   several years” who inadvertently triggered tonight’s parliamentary
   committee debate on effectively banning people from saying anything
   even remotely critical of Islam. It accidentally turned from a
   socialist crusade against property rights, to a socialist crusade in
   favour of an Islamic blasphemy law in Britain.

   Don’t worry – today’s debate isn’t binding. Nor is it in the House of
   Commons chamber. But if you were to turn Sky News on this morning,
   you’d think there was a key government vote on the matter. Of course,
   it has been [28]seized upon by Muslim Members of Parliament.

   But if Mr. Trump has to be banned from Britain, then who else? Well, a
   [29]significant number of Britons, really, who believe, as Saxony’s
   Prime Minister Stanislaw Tillich [30]has said this weekend, that the
   West has “too little experience with Islam” and that inward migration
   should be curbed.

   And what about Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has [31]said
   that “Islam has never been a part of Europe” or Slovakia’s premier
   Robert Fico, who has [32]said that Muslims are “impossible to
   integrate”? Do we ban these people too?

   Do we ban ex-Muslims like [33]Ayaan Hirsi Ali? Do we ban people like
   [34]Sohail Ahmed, a self-professed former radical who has since left
   Islam? Or is the British reaction to Donald Trump’s comments – for that
   is what most thought they were signing the petition about – reserved
   for white American men?

   IFRAME: [35]//renderer.qmerce.com/interaction/569ccab68089e8dd05f6afd4

   Whatever the motivation – and whatever your answer to the questions
   posed above, it is surely obvious at this point that British democracy
   is in a very sorry state.

   And we could talk about why until we’re blue in the face:
   self-censorship, post-colonial guilt, media indoctrination, the liberal
   monopoly on public life… the reasons are endless. Why waste the time?

   Instead I suggest we become far more robust in our language. Far more
   robust in asserting our birthrights. And far more robust in rejecting
   the attempts at manipulation of our nation state.

   Yes, a lot of our efforts this year should go to fighting a European
   referendum so that we may reassert ourselves on the world stage again.
   But don’t forget, once parliament is sovereign again, it will be a
   parliament that we have packed with soft-fascists. Those who want to
   tell us what to eat, drink, smoke, and think. And those who will
   today be discussing what amount of free speech should get you banned
   from this country.

   It is this, coupled with the long-standing liberal monopoly of the
   press and our television channels that we have to think about fighting
   next. Otherwise what is the point in being a sovereign nation?

   Whether or not you agree with me about Donald Trump – you surely
   believe that it is time for radical change in this country. And that
   starts with refusing to vote for the same old parties, buying the same
   old newspapers, and watching the same old TV channels. Turn it off.
