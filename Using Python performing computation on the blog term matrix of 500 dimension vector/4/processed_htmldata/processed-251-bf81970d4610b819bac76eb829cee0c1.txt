   Subject: Foster Parents Child
   This is a sad story and this is still going on today. Sometimes the
   best place for a Child is with their Family. CAS should support the
   Family with Councilling and Outreach Services to help them. There are
   times where it is safer for Children to be raised with other stable
   families...if that can be done.
   My parents fostered for 9 years... we had 4 to 6 kids at a time. We
   were an emergency home for a while then a temp home. We did thankfully
   manage to have 2 girls stay for a few years until they moved out on
   there own.
   I found this web site because I have always had C.Cormier on my mind...
   our 6 year old foster brother in Scarborough (Bridlewood Mall). Charlie
   did not stay that long with us. (he was in a home for 5 years before us
   then they decided NOT to adopt him). Well I was only 11 years old and I
   wanted my parents to adopt him... but never happened. Beleive me I was
   broken hearted.
   I have always had a place in my heart for Charlie; and even though he
   is aprx. 41 today (hey now my ageish) and I hope he is ok today.

   Subject: Powerful
   I just finished my foster PRIDE classes in Il. and am on my way to
   being a foster family. I am always looking for information that will
   help us to be better for the children. This brought me to tears and
   filled my heart. I am glad I came across this and I believe I am very
   lucky that Mr. Dunn is willing to share his stories. I look forward to
   researching more. Hugs-

   Subject: makes me sad.
   I feel so sad to hear that this happens in life, and not far from where
   I live. I want to be able to make a difference in peoples lives and to
   let them know that theyre safe and loved. I can't understand how
   someone could hurt a child physically or emotionally! it tears me to
   peices to hear what this young man (about 10 yrs old than me) had to go
   through! no one deserves that. I have an 8 yr old son and he means the
   world to me. I'd give the world to him. the most important thing I can
   do for him I think is to show him how important he is and how much I
   love him. if I could do this for every child out there who doesnt have
   someone like me in their life, I would. unfortunely life doesn't work
   that way. there will always be selfish people having children and
   hopefully one day it will stop and all children will have GOOD homes.
   my best to all children and people who have been trough this kind of
   ordeal! xox
