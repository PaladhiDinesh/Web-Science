Slash City

   New Yorkers are on edge following a spate of knife crimes on the
   subway.
   [50]Matthew Hennessey
   February 3, 2016
   Public safety
   New York

   In his 1951 poem “Subway Rush Hour,” the Harlem Renaissance writer
   Langston Hughes sketched a portrait of an underground world, where
   people of all colors, ethnicities, and backgrounds are packed so
   tightly together that there’s “no room for fear.” Late last week—in an
   effort to convince New Yorkers that the subways are safe despite a rash
   of recent stabbings and slashings on the transit system—NYPD
   commissioner Bill Bratton made a similar point. “It’s amazing anybody
   can assault anybody because you can’t really move on some of those
   cars,” he said.

   Bratton’s attempts at reassurance clash with the growing sense among
   New Yorkers that the city’s celebrated public-safety gains are
   increasingly under threat. Ten people have been slashed or stabbed so
   far this year on the subways. Overall, such crimes are up nearly 20
   percent. “I’ll chop you up right on this f—-ing train!” 37-year-old Ras
   Alula Nagarit allegedly [51]yelled at two women after bumping into them
   on a crowded platform in Brooklyn. “The police aren’t here now. You’re
   trying to get help from the crowd. They can’t help you! I can just chop
   you and they can’t do nothing!” The argument continued on the train,
   where Nagarit [52]pulled out a machete and slashed one of the women on
   the hand.

   After several slashings over the weekend, Bratton appeared on the John
   Gambling radio show, again trying to tamp down concern. “This is New
   York and occasionally the media and police get focused on a series of
   incidents, and that’s what happened here,” the chief told Gambling. An
   hour later, cops arrested a 37-year-old schizophrenic who picked a
   fight with two strangers, slashing one in the face with a folding
   knife. SLASH AND SPURN, blared the front-page headline of Wednesday’s
   New York Daily News: “Just 1 hour after commish dismisses rash of
   random attacks as ‘abberation,’ 10th victim in just a month is sliced
   on subway.”

   Subway crimes always strike a nerve with New Yorkers. As the Hughes
   poem reminds us, an underground train is an intimate, shared space.
   There’s no place to hide. “The subway isn’t Greenwich Village or Coney
   Island or Harlem or the South Bronx,” said Transit Authority police
   chief James B. Meehan in 1981. “The subway is all of those places . . .
   If a New Yorker lives in Brooklyn, he may not care about a crime that
   occurs in the streets in the Bronx or Queens, but if he rides the
   subway every day he cares very much if the same crimes occur in the
   subway anywhere in the city. In a real sense, the whole system is his
   neighborhood.” Things got so bad in the 1980s that even MTA chief
   Richard Ravitch said that he wouldn’t let his teenage sons ride the
   trains at night. The system lost hundreds of million riders over the
   course of that decade. But New York’s reclamation of public order began
   in the subways.

   What’s causing the surge in knife crimes now? Mayor Bill de Blasio’s
   progressive administration insists that it has nothing to do with the
   highly publicized move away from [53]stop-and-frisk as a
   crime-prevention tool. The city has never been safer, de Blasio and his
   supporters say, and statistically speaking that’s true. In every major
   category—murders, rapes, robberies—crime remains down by massive
   percentages from the bad old days. Total crime [54]is down by 80
   percent since 1990. New Yorkers, though, are savvy enough to know that
   statistics never tell the whole story. And they don’t mean much when
   someone pulls a knife on you in the subway.

   Maybe, despite these reassuring crime numbers, the subway is becoming a
   more troubled space because bad guys (and the mentally ill) have gotten
   a message from the first two years of the de Blasio administration: go
   ahead and carry a knife or a gun, there’s a new sheriff in town—but
   this one puts handcuffs on the cops. “[Criminals] just don’t fear us,”
   a police officer [55]told the Observer. “They know we’re unlikely to
   stop and question people acting in suspicious ways. And we’re not. It’s
   not worth getting called on the carpet and risking our livelihoods.”

   The outbreak of subway slashings and stabbings may have as much to do
   with the city’s abysmal record of dealing with the violent mentally ill
   as it does with policing methods. What is abundantly clear, however, is
   that these crimes aren’t causeless; nor are they nothing to worry
   about. They are the proverbial canary in the coalmine—the first sign
   that things may be turning ugly, at least underground.
