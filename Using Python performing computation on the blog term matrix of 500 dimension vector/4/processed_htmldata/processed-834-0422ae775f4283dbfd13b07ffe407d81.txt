A pro-police statement by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at
Saturday night’s New Hampshire debate prompted an immediate response from
supporters of the Black Lives Matter group.

   In an exchange transcribed by the [27]Washington Post, Trump was asked
   about the left’s antagonism towards police, and the GOP front-runner
   gave an unapologetically pro-law-enforcement answer.

     MODERATOR: Mr. Trump, there are many who argue cell phones and
     smartphones are just now exposing what’s been happening in this
     country for years. Cases of excessive force against minorities.

     As you know, Mr. Trump, on the other side, the FBI director recently
     said there’s a chill wind blowing through law enforcement because of
     increased scrutiny. You have said police are the most mistreated
     people in America. As president, how do you bridge the divide?

     TRUMP: Well, there is a divide, but I have to say that the police
     are absolutely mistreated and misunderstood, and if there is an
     incident, whether it’s an incident done purposely — which is a
     horror, and you should really take very strong action — or if it is
     a mistake, it’s on your newscasts all night, all week, all month,
     and it never ends.

     The police in this country have done an unbelievable job of keeping
     law and order, and they’re afraid for their jobs, they’re afraid of
     the mistreatment they get, and I’m telling you that not only, me
     speaking, minorities all over the country, they respect the police
     of this country and we have to give them more respect.

     They can’t act. They can’t act. They’re afraid for losing their
     pension, their job. They don’t know what to do. And I deal with them
     all the time. We have to give great respect, far greater than we are
     right now, to our really fantastic police.

   Long time, notably white leftist activist Medea Benjamin from the group
   Code Pink clocked in with an emotional response:

     Trump applauds great police force. Tone deaf to cries of mothers
     with sons murdered by police. For him, do [28]#blacklivesmatter? No!
     [29]#GOPDebate

     — Medea Benjamin (@medeabenjamin) [30]February 7, 2016

   David McGuire, an attorney and the legislative and policy director for
   the Connecticut Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union called
   Trump’s statement “despicable.”

     Despicable that Trump downplays police brutality then speaks for
     minorities re police. [31]#GOPDebate [32]#blacklivesmatter

     — David McGuire (@DavidMcGuireEsq) [34]February 7, 2016

   In a follow-up question at the debate, moderator David Muir pressed
   Trump:

     MUIR: Great. Mr. Trump, I did ask about bridging the divide though
     as president. So what would you say to the American families who say
     we have lived through this, we have seen excessive force? What would
     you say to those people?

     TRUMP: Well, they do. And, you know, they sue. Everybody sues,
     right? They see excessive — I mean, they go out, they sue. We have
     so much litigation — I see the courts, I see what they’re doing.
     They sue, and you know what? We don’t want excessive force. But at
     what point — you know, either you’re going to have a police force
     that can do its job…

     I was just up in Manchester, I met with the police officers
     yesterday. Tremendous people. They love the area, they love the
     people, they love all the people. They want to do their job. And
     you’re going to have abuse and you’re going to have problems, and
     you’ve got to solve the problems and you have to weed out the
     problems. But the police in this country are absolutely amazing
     people.

   Trump’s response and didn’t go over well with University of
   Massachusetts Associate Prof. of political science Dr. Maryann Barakso:

     They sue? Does that bring dead people back now?
     [35]#blacklivesmatter “[36]@ZekeJMiller: Trump: "They sue, everyone
     sues"”

     — Maryann Barakso, PhD (@MBarakso) [37]February 7, 2016

   But it wasn’t just white liberals who commented on Trump’s support of
   the police. A couple of conservatives chimed in:

     Trump just lost the [38]#BlackLivesMatter vote. [39]#GOPDebate

     — Sister Toldjah (@sistertoldjah) [40]February 7, 2016

     Trump is not answering that [41]#BlackLivesMatter question
     appropriately. He's not wrong. But that's not how it will be
     reported.

     — BlackGirl Republican (@BlackGirlGOP) [42]February 7, 2016

   Of course, grassroots Black Lives Matter advocates who were unlikely
   Trump voters in the first place were not pleased with Trump’s response.

     I need Trump to come into contact with a rogue officer and see if he
     still sings the same tune. [43]#BlackLivesMatter [44]#GOPDebate

     — Roslyn P. (@RoslynRena) [45]February 7, 2016

     TRUMP DOES NOT GIVE ONE FUCK ABOUT [46]#Blacklivesmatter ALL HE
     TALKED ABOUT IS COPS COPS COPS SMH [47]#GOPDebate

     — FreeSpirit (@spiritmefree1) [48]February 7, 2016

     Trump… you suck. Thanks for not acknowledging the lives lost by law
     enforcement. [53]#BlackLivesMatter [54]#GOPDebate

     — Ashley Nicole (@ashleynicole807) [55]February 7, 2016

     Trump talking about we're not gonna let any one die in the middle of
     the street…..Mike Brown. [56]#GOPDebate [57]#BlackLivesMatter

     — Jamia Lauren (@_justjamia_) [58]February 7, 2016

   Seven years into Barack Obama’s presidency, racial tensions are at an
   all-time high and defending the police has become controversial.
