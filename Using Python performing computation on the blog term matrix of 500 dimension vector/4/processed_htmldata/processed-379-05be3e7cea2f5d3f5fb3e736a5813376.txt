     * Description
       INDICATIONS
       Viagra is indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in
       men. Viagra is a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor. It
       works by helping to increase blood flow into the penis during
       sexual stimulation. This helps you to achieve and maintain an
       erection.
       INSTRUCTIONS
       Use Viagra as directed by your doctor.
          + Take Viagra by mouth with or without food. Viagra may not work
            as quickly if you take it with a high-fat meal.
          + Viagra is usually taken about 1 hour before sexual activity;
            however, it may be taken anywhere from 4 hours to a half hour
            before sexual activity. Talk with your doctor about the best
            way to take Viagra.
          + Viagra can help you have an erection when sexual stimulation
            occurs. An erection will not occur just by taking a pill.
          + Do not take more than the recommended dose or take it more
            often than once daily, or as directed by your doctor.
          + If you miss a dose of Viagra and you still intend to engage in
            sexual activity, take it as soon as you remember. Continue to
            take it as directed by your doctor.
       DOSAGE
       For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 mg taken, as needed,
       approximately 1 hour before sexual activity. However, Viagra may be
       taken anywhere from 4 hours to 0.5 hour before sexual activity.
       Based on effectiveness and toleration, the dose may be increased to
       a maximum recommended dose of 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg. The
       maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day.
       Ask your health care provider any questions you may have about how
       to use Viagra.
       STORAGE
       Store Viagra at 77 degrees F (25 degrees C). Brief storage at
       temperatures between 59 and 86 degrees F (15 and 30 degrees C) is
       permitted. Store away from heat, moisture, and light. Do not store
       in the bathroom. Keep Viagra out of the reach of children and away
       from pets.
       MORE INFO:
       Active Ingredient: Sildenafil citrate.
       Inactive Ingredients: Microcrystalline cellulose, anhydrous dibasic
       calcium phosphate, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate,
       hypromellose, titanium dioxide, lactose, triacetin, and FD & C Blue
       #2 aluminum lake.
     * Safety information
       Do NOT use Viagra if:
          + you are allergic to any ingredient in Viagra
          + you have been advised by your doctor to avoid sexual activity
            because of heart problems
          + you are taking nitrates (eg, isosorbide, nitroglycerin) in any
            form (eg, tablet, capsule, patch, ointment), or nitroprusside
          + you use certain recreational drugs called "poppers" (eg, amyl
            nitrate or nitrite, butyl nitrate or nitrite)
          + you take another PDE5 inhibitor (eg, tadalafil, vardenafil) or
            another medicine that contains sildenafil.
       Contact your doctor or health care provider right away if any of
       these apply to you.
       Some medical conditions may interact with Viagra. Tell your doctor
       or pharmacist if you have any medical conditions, especially if any
       of the following apply to you:
          + if you are taking any prescription or nonprescription
            medicine, herbal preparation, or dietary supplement
          + if you have allergies to medicines, foods, or other substances
          + if you have a deformed penis (eg, cavernosal fibrosis,
            Peyronie disease), blood cell problems (eg, leukemia, multiple
            myeloma, sickle cell anemia), or any other condition that may
            increase the risk of a prolonged erection (priapism)
          + if you have a history of a prolonged (more than 4 hours) or
            painful erection (priapism)
          + if you have a history of certain eye problems (eg, macular
            degeneration, optic neuropathy, retinitis pigmentosa, sudden
            vision loss in one or both eyes) or hearing problems (eg,
            ringing in the ears, decreased hearing, hearing loss)
          + if you have a history of liver or kidney problems, lung
            problems (eg, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease), high or low
            blood pressure, ulcers, bleeding problems, heart problems (eg,
            angina, aortic stenosis, heart failure, irregular heartbeat),
            or blood vessel problems
          + if you have a history of heart attack, stroke, or
            life-threatening irregular heartbeat, especially within the
            past 6 months.
       Some medicines may interact with Viagra. Tell your health care
       provider if you are taking any other medicines, especially any of
       the following:
          + Alpha-blockers (eg, doxazosin), medicines for high blood
            pressure, nitrates (eg, isosorbide, nitroglycerin), or
            nitroprusside because severe low blood pressure with
            dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting may occur
          + Azole antifungals (eg, itraconazole, ketoconazole), H[2]
            antagonists (eg, cimetidine), HIV protease inhibitors (eg,
            ritonavir, saquinavir), macrolide antibiotics (eg,
            erythromycin), narcotic analgesics (eg, dihydrocodeine), or
            telithromycin because they may increase the risk of Viagra's
            side effects
          + Bosentan or rifampin because they may decrease Viagra's
            effectiveness.
       This may not be a complete list of all interactions that may occur.
       Ask your health care provider if Viagra may interact with other
       medicines that you take. Check with your health care provider
       before you start, stop, or change the dose of any medicine.
       Important safety information:
          + Viagra may cause dizziness, drowsiness, fainting, or blurred
            vision. These effects may be worse if you take it with alcohol
            or certain medicines. Use Viagra with caution. Do not drive or
            perform other possible unsafe tasks until you know how you
            react to it.
          + Viagra may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting;
            alcohol, hot weather, exercise, or fever may increase these
            effects. To prevent them, sit up or stand slowly, especially
            in the morning. Sit or lie down at the first sign of any of
            these effects.
          + Patients with heart problems who take Viagra may be at
            increased risk for heart-related side effects, including heart
            attack or stroke. Symptoms of a heart attack may include
            chest, shoulder, neck, or jaw pain; numbness of an arm or leg;
            severe dizziness, headache, nausea, stomach pain, or vomiting;
            fainting; or vision changes. Symptoms of a stroke may include
            confusion, vision or speech changes, one-sided weakness, or
            fainting. Contact your doctor or seek medical attention right
            away if you experience these symptoms.
          + Viagra may rarely cause a prolonged (eg, more than 4 hours) or
            painful erection. This could happen even when you are not
            having sex. If this is not treated right away, it could lead
            to permanent sexual problems such as impotence. Contact your
            doctor right away if you have an erection that lasts more than
            4 hours.
          + Viagra does not stop the spread of HIV or other sexually
            transmitted diseases (STDs) to others through sexual contact.
            Use barrier methods of birth control (eg, condoms) if you have
            HIV infection or an STD.
          + Viagra will not prevent pregnancy. If your partner may become
            pregnant and you wish to avoid pregnancy, be sure to use an
            effective form of birth control.
          + Viagra may uncommonly cause mild, temporary vision changes
            (eg, blurred vision, sensitivity to light, blue/green color
            tint to vision). Contact your doctor if vision changes persist
            or are severe.
          + Rarely, an eye problem called nonarteritic anterior ischemic
            optic neuropathy (NAION) has been reported in patients who
            took Viagra. This may lead to decreased vision or permanent
            loss of vision in some cases. If you notice a sudden decrease
            in vision or loss of vision in one or both eyes, contact your
            doctor right away.
          + Sudden decreases in hearing and loss of hearing have been
            reported in some patients who have taken Viagra. Sometimes
            they also noticed ringing in the ears or dizziness. If you
            notice a sudden decrease or loss of hearing, contact your
            doctor right away.
          + Do not use other medicines or treatments for ED while you are
            taking Viagra without first checking with your doctor.
          + Use Viagra with caution in the elderly; they may be more
            sensitive to its effects.
          + Viagra is not recommended for use in children younger 18
            years.
     * Side effects
       All medicines may cause side effects, but many people have no, or
       minor, side effects.
       Check with your doctor if any of these most common side effects
       persist or become bothersome:
       Diarrhea; dizziness; flushing; headache; heartburn; stuffy nose;
       upset stomach.
       Seek medical attention right away if any of these severe side
       effects occur:
       Severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty
       breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face,
       lips, or tongue); chest pain; fainting; fast or irregular
       heartbeat; memory loss; numbness of an arm or leg; one-sided
       weakness; painful or prolonged erection; ringing in the ears;
       seizure; severe or persistent dizziness; severe or persistent
       vision changes; sudden decrease or loss of hearing; sudden decrease

       provider.
