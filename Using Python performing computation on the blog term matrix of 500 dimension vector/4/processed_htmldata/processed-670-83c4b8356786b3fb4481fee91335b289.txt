       blockbuster that helps define the legacy of the court under Chief
       Justice John Roberts. That&#39;s because the justices appear likely

   By [181]Jessica Chasmar - The Washington Times - Monday, February 8,
   2016

   Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump is driving young
   Muslims “closer to the terrorists,” said actress and feminist icon
   [182]Jane Fonda.

   [183]Ms. Fonda, 78, appeared Sunday night at the Women’s Equality and
   ERA Coalition’s “Night of Comedy” in Manhattan, accusing Mr. Trump of
   “fanning the flames of people’s anxieties and racism,” the New York
   Daily News [184]reported.
   [INS: :INS]

   “It’s terrible and it’s dangerous,” [185]Ms. Fonda said. “Even if he
   doesn’t make it, which I don’t think he will, the fact that he’s said
   the things he’s said about Muslims for example, the damage has been
   done. All those young Muslims now can say, ‘Yeah I guess they really
   are waging a war against us,’ and it will draw them closer to the
   terrorists. I think it’s really, really dangerous.”

   She said she is supporting Hillary Clinton for president, but heaped
   praise on the Democratic front-runner’s rival, Sen. Bernard Sanders.

   “I think he’s great,” [186]Ms. Fonda said. “He’s great at describing
   what one of the main problems is, which is wealth equality. She’s good
   at saying how we’re going to solve problems and she’s going to get it
   done.”

   The Daily News reported that [187]Ms. Fonda’s comments came just a few
   hours after fellow feminist Gloria Steinem, who was also at the comedy
   night, was forced to [188]apologize for an earlier comment that young
   women who support Mr. Sanders are just doing it to chase after “boys.”
