Track cell service along your subway route with this new app

   “Being miserable and treating other people like dirt is every New
   Yorker’s God-given right,” fictional New York City Mayor Lenny Clotch
   famously said in 1989’s Ghostbusters II. So is complaining about every
   and anything, especially fancy new stuff like cell service in the
   subway. We’ve barely had it for more than a year, and already it’s the
   source of many complaints. It’s here for one station, gone the next,
   which leaves you with barely enough time to post that wicked rejoinder
   on Facebook.

   Along comes [16]Subspotting, a new app to help track Wi-Fi service and
   cell reception for the four major carriers — AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon,
   and Sprint — along your daily route. Say you’re traveling on the Q
   train from Astoria to Coney Island. Subspotting will let you know which
   stations along the way have cell and Wi-Fi service (most of the ones in
   Manhattan) and which don’t (Brooklyn looks pretty dark until the train
   goes aboveground). The app is currently only available for iOS users.

   The project was first conceived by Daniel Goddemeyer, who runs the New
   York City-based research and design practice Object Form Field Culture.
   Over two weeks, Goddemeyer gathered data on cell and Wi-Fi service
   along all 660 miles of subway using a custom data logger. Then he and
   German-based programmer Dominikus Baur crunched the numbers and turned
   it into an app.

   Subspotting

   New Yorkers have been getting Wi-Fi in their subway stations in dribs
   and drabs since 2013, when the Metropolitan Transportation Authority
   announced it had contracted a company called [17]Transit Wireless to
   wire all 278 underground stations. Since then, 147 stations have been
   brought online, a spokesperson for the company says. The project was
   originally slated to be completed at the end of 2017, but last
   December, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced he was [18]moving
   the deadline up a year.

   Under that new timeline, the entire system will be wired by the end of
   2016, at which point the Subspotting app may become pretty irrelevant,
   unless there are outages, which in New York City is almost a given. And
   then the complaining will begin anew, and Subspotting may become useful
   again.
   (function(a,b,c,d,e,f){a[d]||(a[d]=
   function(){(a[d].q=a[d].q||[]).push([arguments,+new Date])});
   e=b.createElement(c);f=b.getElementsByTagName(c)[0];
   e.src=’https://s.yimg.com/uq/syndication/yad.js’;e.async=true;
   f.parentNode.insertBefore(e,f)}(window,document,’script’,’yad’));
   yad(‘2ee776b0-e870-3477-bc1c-3cdf1f2a0f9f’);
