   On the interface between technology, people and society

Social media has lost its youthful promise and is looking old, tired
and grumpy

   It is 5 years since the potential of social media was considered
   limitless. Not only was social media revolutionary, but it was
   literally capable of bringing about revolutions such as the uprisings
   of the “[58]Arab Spring”. There was no part of our social lives that
   platforms like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn could not change.
   Concepts like having a “[59]social graph” became generally understood,
   as was the ability of those graphs to determine what we bought, how we
   felt, who our friends were and where we would work. It was believed
   that social media would be with us from birth to [60]death, cataloguing
   the journey on the way.

Ignoring the negatives

   The hype of social media enabled social media to largely wave off the
   negatives that have been there from the start. There was Facebook
   running [61]secret experiments on its users to manipulate their mood.
   And the ever-present harassment of almost everyone at some time or
   another, but typically women. This became so much a part of the
   platform that protracted bouts of harassment even got their own
   hashtags like [62]#Gamergate. Rape and murder threats have become
   [63]accepted as being part of the price, according to at least one
   female reporter, that women need to pay for the “freedom of speech”
   afforded by social media.

   And then there was terrorism. Social media it turns out, seems to be
   especially effective as a platform for [64]terrorist propaganda with
   Twitter having to constantly delete tens of thousands of accounts
   related to ISIS alone.

Where have all the teenagers gone?

   As is often the way, young adults have been the “[65]sentinel users”,
   those to first realise that actually social media could be boring, had
   become colonised by their parents and generally had more negatives than
   positives. Teens have been [66]leaving Facebook in their millions. This
   hasn’t affected Facebook yet because of the [67]continued growth of
   users in different countries.

   The other sentinel warning that social media may have run its course is
   the stock market. LinkedIn, up until last week, was the social media
   platform that not only could make money but was promising the type of
   growth that supported the high price of its shares. This came to a
   crash when it reported that the future was not going to be as strong as
   expected and that advertising in particular was not working as well as
   it hoped. The market reacted spectacularly with LinkedIn losing nearly
   45% its [68]value overnight leaving it at levels it last saw in 2012.

   Twitter of course continues to struggle to convince anyone that it has
   a viable business plan to make money and this has been reflected in its
   continued [69]downward plunge in value.

   The disillusionment of the markets reflects a lack of interest by
   advertisers and other businesses in any platform other than Facebook
   (for now). What will be interesting to see however is whether that
   sentiment carries over into other consumer groups. Journalists may stop
   writing stories about whatever is trending on Twitter, or quoting the
   obligatory [70]tweet that serves as a replacement for an authoratative
   quote.

The unwinable challenge for social media

   Ultimately, it seems that there is no way that all of the current
   platforms can all be successful at the same time. For most users, there
   is simply not enough time to interact in any meaningful way with
   multiple platforms and find anything worthwhile amongst the noise. And
   that is assuming of course, that none of the noise was negative,
   hateful or hurtful, which automatically makes it much harder to see
   anything positive. No amount of [71]tinkering of timelines by companies
   like Twitter are going to help because the expectations of its users is
   so diverse.

   The other difficulty that social media platforms face is that their
   success is dependant on scale, and that in turn has depended on the
   inflating effect of hype of groups like the media and the markets. Once
   one of the groups gives up, it is far more likely that the entire
   network collapses, leaving at best, a vestigial platform like
   [72]myspace.

   Social media itself is not going to disappear and it is nowhere near
   being on life-support. Social media, like its audience, has moved from
   being youthful and full of promise to something more akin to middle
   age, railing at its lost youth.
