Noted trans activist attacked on NYC subway; Attacker being sought

   By [21]Lexie Cannes on [22]February 5, 2016 • ( [23]2 )

   [24]jennifer attack nyc LEXIE CANNES STATE OF TRANS — The New York City
   trans community is seeking the identification of the woman who attacked
   noted NYC trans activist Jennifer Louise Lopez on a subway in Manhattan
   last Saturday night January 30th.

   Lopez was attacked on the D train express en route to the 125th Street
   uptown station around 10PM. Lopez managed to capture video of her
   attacker and is asking for the public’s help in catching the heavyset
   woman who managed to get away.

   Lopez suffered severe blows to the head and was taken to a hospital
   with a bleeding eye. Examinations of her injury later revealed serious
   damage necessitating future surgeries and a chance of losing sight in
   that eye.

   Lopez says she was attacked after sitting down next to the woman who
   then began to accuse her of being a man. Lopez tried to elude the woman
   by getting off the train at 125th then boarding again, but the woman
   followed her both off, then back on the train. Police have investigated
   the attack.

   Any information about this woman can be posted in the comments section.

   I hope to have further contact info for anyone having information about
   the crime.

       Well, this is heartbreaking. I pray that Jennifer keeps her eye
       sight. And someone needs to step forward with information about
       this dangerous, violent woman.
