Woman Fed Up With 'Mum Shaming' Rants About Why She Fed Kids McDonalds For

   A [172]woman has ranted on Facebook about why it's okay to feed her
   kids McDonalds, after being fed up of constant "[173]mum shaming" about
   food.

   Paige-Alexis Cunningham from Melbourne gave honest details about what
   her kids eat on a daily basis, claiming there no right way to feed your
   children.

   The post was sparked after seeing various posts from mums on Facebook
   about "what not to feed your kids" and a constant pressure for
   everything to be healthy.

   [174]"Why did my kids have Happy Meals and juice?" she wrote on the
   post. "Because they wanted it, we were out in public and I was bloody
   exhausted and didn't want to fight with them.

   "They picked at it and then demolished my sushi - which is terrible for
   kids by the way - the rice is full of sugar and the tuna is full of
   mercury."

     Afternoon snack of watermelon and a bit of a rant. Lately my feed
     has been flooded with people sharing 'what not to...

     Posted by [175]Paige-Alexis Cunningham on [176]Thursday, 28 January
     2016

   Cunningham, whose [177]post has been shared more than 17,000 times,
   started the "rant" by sharing a photo of her kids' afternoon snack of
   watermelon.

   "Afternoon snack of watermelon and a bit of a rant," she wrote. "Lately
   my feed has been flooded with people sharing 'what not to feed your
   kids' 'I'll never let my kids have that again' and so on. So much mum
   shaming within these posts.

   "We're having watermelon for afternoon tea. For lunch we had McDonald's
   Happy Meals. For breakfast one kid had rice bubbles, the other refused
   to eat. At some stage they had some apple juice.

   "Today they've also had sushi, bananas, tonnes of water each and
   sandwiches made on preservative-free bread.

   "They also eat a tonne of those yoghurt pouches, but lately these have
   been added to the mum shaming list for having sugar in them.

   "And now the whole ham debacle, yeah processed meats aren't great for
   kids. My kids eat cocktail frankfurters while we do the groceries, they
   also polish off a punnet of blueberries each by the time we've finished
   the fresh produce section."

     2015

   Cunningham continued to say this "mum shaming" about healthy food needs
   to stop.

   "It's the same debate as breast is best, not formula," she continued.

   "Breast is best, if it's best for you. At the end of the day fed
   children are best. Don't let them eat junk all the time, but don't lay
   the guilt on yourself or any other parent if they ate two minute
   noodles and Nutella today.

   "Educate yourself about positive food choices by all means, but don't
   feel the need to share every bit of crap you read and further the mum
   shaming, everything in moderation and well done for feeding your kids.
   Rant over."

   Since [180]writing the rant on Facebook on 29 January, Cunningham said
   she was not expecting it to go viral.

   The post divided opinion among parents online.

   "I thought this was very well written and do much the truth," one
   person wrote. "There is no right way or wrong way of parenting. Just do
   the best you can."

   Another agreed, adding: "This mother should be congratulated on her
   very common-sense approach to the way she is bringing up her children
   without the fears, phobias and fixations about different foods.

   "She has a very healthy and holistic outlook on life and her children
   will always thank her for this. Everything in moderation is the best
   way for a healthy, happy and well balanced upbringing."

   Other mums said the post made them "feel so much better" having also
   reading these food-shaming posts online.

   But those disagreeing felt Cunningham was ignoring the fact these foods
   are detrimental to her children's [181]health.

   "That it literally the dumbest thing I have ever read," one person
   commented. "Obviously you need to take your own advice and educate
   yourself. No wonder there's so many fat unhealthy children."

   Another person who disagreed with Cunningham wrote: "As if you would
   pollute your child's body just because you're too tired or lazy to feed
   them a healthy meal.

   "Stop poisoning your children. It's not mum shaming, it's pollution
   shaming. Seriously people, wake up."

   Cunningham [182]later posted an update saying her main objective was to
   point out how much mum shaming exists online.

   "Yes there's been some negative comments above, but hey I wasn't asking
   anyone to take my side and parent exactly the way I do, there is no
   'right' way to parent so I don't assume my way is right, just right for
   us," she wrote.

   "My objective was just to point out on facet of parenting: feeding our
   children, and how much mum shaming there is surrounding it.

   "Yes educational posts are totally fine to share, that's not what I was
   referring to. It's the way they're shared, your tone, your words.

   "At the end of the day there is no medal for 'mother of the year'.
   There is just this blessing and huge responsibility of being parents,
   which is left up to said parents to make the choices of how to raise
   their babies.

   "We should be supporting other mums, not vilifying them for whatever
   choices they make. What works for you doesn't always work for me and
   mine.

   "Do what you gotta do and get through the day loving your kid."

   10 Healthy Foods That Are In Fact Quite Bad For You...
   of
   
   
     *
     *

     * Granola
       Granola is not as nutritious as it may appear. Not many people know
       that it contains a lot of sugar and very little fibre.
     * Sushi Whilst rice and vegetables seem healthy, sushi (especially
       the cheap kind) is high is salt and calories and low in protein.
     * Dried Fruit
       Dried fruit may be a convenient snacking option, but the truth is
       it contains more sugar than fresh fruit.
     * Frozen Yoghurt
       You can pile on as many fresh fruit topping as you like, but frozen
       yoghurt itself is as bad as eating ice-cream. Have this as a
       dessert, not a healthy snack.
     * Smoothies
       Smoothies may seem like a healthy option but they are packed full
       of sugar, some even contain more sugar than fizzy drinks.
     * Multi-Grain Bread
       Don't be fooled by multi-grain and wheat breads. Read the label, as
       they are often made with ‘refined grains’ which reduce its
       nutritional value.
     * Cereal Bars
       You may think that cereal bars are an ideal alternative for
       breakfast, especially when you're on the go - but beware, as they
       are full of saturated fats and sugars.
     * Baked Beans
       Whilst baked beans are high in fibre, most tins contain lots of
       sugar and additives.
     * Pretzels
       Pretzels make for a great snack, but eat them in moderation, as
       they are often high in sodium.
     * Reduced Fat Peanut Butter Don't let the name deceive you. Reduced
       fat peanut butter actually contains the same amount of calories as
       the normal kind.
