   Like the presidential primary season, the Hollywood guild awards do not
   come as a perfect or predictable whole.

   Each guild has its own quirks--its favorites, pet peeves and
   demographics--that help determine the winners. A triumph among actors,
   for instance, doesn’t assure a win among directors, just as a victory
   in New Hampshire hardly locks down success in South Carolina.

   Still, taken as a composite, certain patterns emerge. As a rule of
   physics, awards bodies do not tend to jut off completely in their own
   direction. Movies that win one of the major prizes have a higher
   probability of winning another. And at some point, as with primary‎
   season, all that momentum tends to snowball and create an air of
   invincibility, which is how movies like "Slumdog Millionaire," ""Argo"
   and "The King's  Speech" each swept the three major guild awards and
   then went on to win the Oscar best picture in their respective years.

   All of this is why the [9]win for [10]Alejandro G. Inarritu's
   revenge-survival epic [11]"The Revenant" on Saturday night at the
   Directors Guild Awards -- the last of the troika of prizes from major
   guilds that also includes producers and actors -- is so surprising.
   (The fourth such honor, from screenwriters, doesn't carry the same
   weight because the guild's eligibility rules are more restrictive and
   exclude a number of top contenders.)

   "The Revenant" had not won top honors from the other two major bodies,
   the Screen Actors Guild or Producers Guild of America -- those went to
   Tom McCarthy's journalism-centric scandal pic  "Spotlight" and [12]Adam
   McKay's financial-crisis black comedy "The Big Short," respectively.

   In fact, Inarritu was actually a question mark at the DGA. He had won
   the group's prize last year, for "Birdman," which made some pundits
   think voters would tire of him and choose someone else. (He's the first
   director to win the DGA prize in consecutive years in the 65-plus-year
   history of the award.) So right off the bat the win is a little
   unexpected.

   But Saturday night's developments are even more surprising  because,
   with "The Revenant" win, we now have a recent awards season anomaly.
   The Inarritu victory means that for the first time in 11 years, no
   movie that triumphed with one of the three major film guilds topped the
   list of another.

   Yep, in each of the previous 10 years, a film has won the top prize
   from at least two of the three guilds (including that [19]wacky 2013,
   when there was a PGA tie between “Gravity” and “12 Years a Slave;"
   "Gravity" also won the DGA) .

   In five of the eight years before this one, a single movie actually won
   all three prizes. This includes last year, when "Birdman" swept the
   trio on its way to the best picture Oscar.

   But that all went to seed this year.

   The split we just witnessed signals what those of us in the punditry
   business, very officially, call "a wide-open race," or less officially,
   a "we don't really know what's going on so we'll just keep forecasting"
   race.

   Certainly there are specific dynamics to why that happened, and if
   you're even a casual reader of awards-season commentaries, you'll know
   some of what they are. The three guilds consist of people with
   different temperaments, valuing different skills, and each of the three
   winners played to those preferences.

   Kleiner.

   (Glenn Whipp)

   "Spotlight" is the sort of robust ensemble piece that every actor
   dreams of being a part of, so the movie won SAG's top prize. "The Big
   Short" is the kind of tonally tricky effort that keeps a lot of plates
   spinning, so it attracted the affections of producers. And "The
   Revenant" features the kind of bold filmmaking — and, maybe even more
   important, the [26]directorial self-sacrifice — that filmmakers tend to
   prize. So it won the DGA.

   But that doesn't entirely explain the split. Contenders come with
   different strengths in many years. And yet we rarely see this kind of
   divergence.

   At least, we rarely see this kind of divergence of late. You'll notice
   that a lot of these patterns involve recent awards season history. The
   10 years that preceded this one has indeed been a period of consensus
   and lock-step. But if you go back to the 10 years before that (the SAG
   awards were created in 1995, so this is essentially the beginning of
   contemporary guild-award history), something else was happening.

   surprises and reactions | [30]Top nominee photos | [31]Oscars are so
   white, again

   In three of those years, we had the same divergence we had this year --
   no movie managed to win more than one guild. That's how it went down in
   the 2000 season ("Gladiator," "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," and
   "Traffic" split PGA, DGA and SAG); in 2001 ("Moulin Rouge!" "A
   Beautiful Mind," and "Gosford Park"); and in 2004 ("The Aviator,"
   "Million Dollar Baby" and "Sideways"). No group could seem to agree
   with any other group.

   Basically what it comes down to is that for the first 10 years of
   guild-award history the split happened three times. In the following 10
   years it didn't happen at all. (If you're curious and/or Inarritu's
   publicist, you'll be interested to know that it was the DGA winner that
   went on to win best picture in two of the three previous split years.)

   Which leads to an interesting theory. The past 10 years have been a
   time of increasing coverage of awards season. First that was true with
   the blogs and print special sections that began taking off in the 2000s
   and, later, with the social-media platforms that amplified their
   megaphone. It all turned awards prognosticating into a noisy, real-time
   (if still very much pseudo-scientific) enterprise. And more noise, as
   my colleague Charles McNulty has [32]eloquently written, tends to drown
   out those voices arguing for outliers and passion choices.

   story

   Award season bodies are too small, and guild choices too entropic, for
   any of this to be empirical, let alone airtight. But certainly it's a
   coincidence worth noting. Before awards coverage reached its modern
   fever pitch, awards groups would at least somewhat regularly go their
   own way. Since the decibel level was cranked up, it's hardly happened
   at all.

   So what's going on this year? The blog and social-media noise hasn't
   gone anywhere--in fact, it's louder than ever. So is this just an
   exception to the trend? Or is it a sign of a kind of bristling, a
   hive-mind reaction against all the predictions and recommendations that
   so many people who don't vote for awards make to people who do?

   Is it a momentary outlier? Or a restless response, as in our politics,
   to a handed-down status quo?  That already seems to be afoot at the
   Oscars with "Room," an outside-the-system upstart that[35] defeated
   three better-funded and more traditional contenders in three different
   categories, including the most establishment of establishment
   candidates, Ridley Scott.

   Is this all just a blip, or something that signals a more deep-seated
   resistance to how awards season is supposed to go?

   There's no immediate answer to these questions. But they've become
   increasingly noteworthy ones to ask, just as they have with politics.
   Are the Donald Trumps and [36]Bernie Sanders of the world -- and,
   indeed, the larger unpredictable group of candidates of which they're a
   part -- simply a function of a strange and anxious moment? Or a
   harbinger of a new reality, in which convention and consensus becomes a
   non-factor, even a hindrance?

   I'm not suggesting that some kind of grassroots uprising is happening
   in Hollywood. Awards season voters are still very much subject to what
   movies the studios send out and campaign for -- and, yes, for better or
   worse, what ink-stained wretches like myself and my colleagues say.
   Movies aren't politics, and all three of these guild winners are
   well-oiled, conventionally backed contenders (even if the more modestly
   budgeted "Spotlight," coming from the smaller distributor Open Road, is
   a far more independent choice than its Big Studio rivals).

   ... (Susan King)

   But at a cultural moment emphasizing the upstart and the outsider, one
   that almost seems to be reveling in a kind of electoral chaos, it's
   fair to wonder if voters are also feeling that itch, wanting to hark
   back to a time when Oscar season wasn't a foregone conclusion. One
   academy member I spoke to recently said they were tired of being told
   by "all these pundits"  what they should do and think. A curmudegonely
   sentiment, to be sure, but not, I suspect, an uncommon one. (This
   feeling might also apply to how voters feel about the widespread
   coverage of the diversity debate, but that's another matter.)

   One of the movies, "The Big Short," has an even more direct connection
   to the current political-revolution moment: It's [41]become a favorite
   of Sanders, who said "damn right I have" when asked if he'd seen it and
   called it an "excellent film."

   Sadly for both our sanity and the collective good, neither the current
   awards season nor the presidential election cycle is near the finish
   line. The way voters have been wriggling around, we may yet see a few
   more surprises before all is said and done this year. And, perhaps,
   even beyond this year.
