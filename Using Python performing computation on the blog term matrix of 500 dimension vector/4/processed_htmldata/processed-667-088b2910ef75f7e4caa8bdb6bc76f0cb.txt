The real threat to Wall Street is not Bernie Sanders —  it’s Donald Trump

Bankers are worried about Sanders. But Trump's the one whose attacks are
increasingly dehumanizing — and dangerous

   A little less than a week ago, Goldman Sachs CEO and Chairman
   [139]Lloyd Blankfein told the fine people of CNBC’s “Squawk Box” about
   something that been worrying him as of late. It wasn’t the threat of
   climate change, ISIS, or [140]another global recession.

   It was Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ historic — and unapologetically
   populist — campaign for president. The self-described Democratic
   Socialist’s White House run, Blankfein said, “has the potential to be a
   dangerous moment.” And not just for the rich, either, but “for anybody
   who is a little bit out of line.”

   Besides Jamie Dimon, it’s hard to think of another banker today with
   Blankfein’s notoriety. Yet his criticisms of Sanders didn’t have much
   to do with the senator’s views on Wall Street — or at least not
   directly. What worried him instead, he argued, was how the Sanders
   movement encouraged an uncompromising approach to American politics.

   In the world of Bernie Sanders, Blankfein said, being open to
   compromise is “a liability.” If a politician were to buck the Sanders
   approach and drift “one millimeter off [of] their extreme position,”
   they would, he said, “have to back-track and swear to … never
   compromise.” The whole dynamic was “incredible”; a real “moment in
   history.”

   Needless to say, Blankfein’s comment was a gift to the Sanders camp.
   But it was also something else. Namely, it was a sign that the profound
   anxiety Wall Street felt in the wake of so much public resentment and
   anger has not dissipated. But it was also a sign that Wall Street,
   locked in a [141]Zuccotti state of mind, was missing the real threat.

   Because the rhetoric that should give the 1 percent the most pause
   nowadays is not coming from the far-left; and it’s not coming from
   Bernie Sanders. It’s coming from the populist right; and it’s coming
   from none other than fellow 1 percenter Donald Trump.

   Sanders is obviously not shy about thwacking what he likes to call “the
   billionaire class.” But by and large, he likes to keep his rhetoric
   pretty vague. He talks about “too big to fail” banks and “special
   interests,” of course. But, at this point, that’s standard rhetoric for
   most Democrats (and more than a few Republicans). Pretty ho-hum.

   Trump, meanwhile, has never been one to mince words or shy away from a
   fight. But while that trait has been in evidence mostly through his
   vicious attacks on Mexicans, “illegals,” Megyn Kelly, Jeb Bush and “the
   establishment,” Trump is now starting to train his fire on a new
   target. And he’s using some of his most dangerous rhetoric yet.

   During a weekend rally in New Hampshire, according to [142]a report
   from the Washington Examiner’s Byron York, Trump broke from typical GOP
   rhetoric even more than usual. Instead of railing against high taxes or
   big government, Trump, York says, was “in full populist mode,” railing
   against big pharma, big insurance, big oil and big defense.

   At times, York reports, Trump even went so far that he “sounded like
   Bernie Sanders, if Sanders had Trump’s sense of showmanship.” But what
   York quotes Trump saying about the big donors who support his opponents
   is far more incendiary than anything Sanders himself has uttered. These
   corporate fat cats, Trump raged, were “bloodsuckers.”

   “Bloodsucker” is not a word you hear often in U.S. politics; and for
   good reason. It’s not because the word is so brutish and Americans are
   otherwise so cuddly; it’s because “bloodsucker” — like “cockroach,”
   “vermin,” “parasite,” or “disease” — is considered too dehumanizing and
   [143]eliminationist. It’s how Nazis and Stalinists speak. (Not for
   nothing was it the slur especially popular in France during the Reign
   of Terror.)

   And the reason why “bloodsucker” is so dangerous, and why any lefty who
   uttered it would be rightly savaged, is because of what it suggests.
   The implication is that the body politic — “the American people” — is,
   by nature, unified. Anyone who differs with “the people’s”
   self-declared tribunes, therefore, is unnatural and alien. They are
   dangerous outsiders; they are a threat.

   Bernie Sanders does not talk like this. He knows better — both as the
   progeny of [144]Holocaust survivors, and as a decent man. He knows
   where this kind of talk has often led, and he scrupulously avoids it.
   Yet for reasons unclear, Wall Street still seems to regard Sanders —
   not Trump — as politician most likely to turn the mob against them. He
   isn’t, not by a long shot; and it’s long past time they recognized that
   fact.

       Harry Bosch lives in the hills just above the Cahuenga Pass, the

       contemplate the city and find inspiration. Connelly also had his
