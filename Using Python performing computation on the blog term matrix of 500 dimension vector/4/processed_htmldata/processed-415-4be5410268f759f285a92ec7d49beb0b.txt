Walmart Opens OneOps Cloud Management to the Masses

   By Jack M. Germain • [74]LinuxInsider • [75]ECT News Network
   Jan 28, 2016 1:19 PM PT

   [76]Walmart on Tuesday announced that it has posted the code for its
   [77]OneOps cloud application life cycle management platform on GitHub.
   Walmart Opens OneOps Cloud Management to the Masses

   The company developed the OneOps platform for building and launching
   cloud-based applications across varied storage environments that change
   frequently. It lets e-commerce vendors deploy apps on platforms from
   Microsoft Azure, Rackspace and CenturyLink public clouds to private or
   hybrid environments built with OpenStack.

   One of its chief features is letting organizations switch between
   providers to take advantage of changes in pricing, features and
   scalability, Walmart said. Developers can more easily build and deploy
   cloud apps as a vendor-agnostic technology.

   Open sourcing OneOps could be a gift that keeps on giving for Walmart.
   If OneOps develops a significant user and contributor base, the company
   can shed at least part of its reputation as an old-school retail
   colossus, according to Charles King, principal analyst at [78]Pund-IT.

   "This latest move is the result of an IT modernization effort that the
   company began in 2011. Yet it hasn't received much credit for being
   forward thinking," he told LinuxInsider.

   "Success should polish Walmart's reputation, which could deflect some
   of the recent challenges and criticism the company has suffered. It
   wouldn't hurt for the company to be seen as a vanguard of retail
   innovation," King added.

What It Does

   OneOps lets developers build and launch products faster and more easily
   maintain them throughout their entire product life, Walmart said.

   It enables developers to code their products in a hybrid, multicloud
   environment, giving them the ability to test and switch between cloud
   providers, according to the company.

   Couchbase has integrated its NoSQL technology into the OneOps platform.
   OneOps also supports Node.js, ElasticSearch, Docker and others.

   One benefit is the ability to automatically manage the application when
   unforeseen changes occur in the cloud, scaling or repairing it as
   needed, Walmart said. Software engineers can quickly spin up virtual
   machines and begin coding without having to spend hours specifying the
   intricacies of a specific cloud environment, as OneOps models that for
   them.

Supply Chain

   Walmart purchased the initial OneOps platform in 2013 from a startup
   company founded two years earlier. That purchase fueled the conversion
   of its own e-commerce software from a cumbersome monolithic application
   into a global e-commerce platform.

   Since then, Walmart has grown the platform on which its 3,000 engineers
   build and manage new products. Walmart manages its e-commerce sites
   with OneOps. Its engineers use the platform to commit more than 30,000
   changes per month, it said.

   Other features include monitoring tools, self-fixing capabilities and
   auto-scaling tools to manage the size of a given cluster. For admins,
   the platform offers integration with enterprise identity services,
   quota management and a configuration management system.

No-Compete Plan

   OneOps poses no direct competitive threat to [79]Amazon's cloud
   business --at least not overtly, Pund-IT's King said.

   It's compatible with all the major public cloud services, including
   Amazon Web Services, so broad use of the platform could lead to
   additional business for Amazon. However, freely giving OneOps to other
   businesses may have an impact, he noted.

   "Walmart is providing them powerful options that lie well beyond
   Amazon's sphere of influence. Some may consider that to be a thumb in
   Amazon's eye, but I think it's a bit subtler than that," said King.

   Open sourcing its cloud management platform is not an attempt to
   compete with Amazon, according to Walmart. It's merely a way to extend
   the usefulness of OneOps.

   "We have no interest in competing with cloud providers or becoming one.
   Our focus has always been on the millions of customers who shop Walmart
   globally each week," Walmart spokesperson Bao Nguyen said.

   What it gains is more powerful technology and new ways for OneOps to
   adapt to existing and new technology, he told LinuxInsider.

Couchbase Kudos for OneOps

   [80]Couchbase developers were among the first to voice support for the
   Walmart announcement this week. Couchbase is a distributed NoSQL
   database engineered for performance, scalability and availability
   offered via OneOps as a NoSQL database option.

   Walmart is the model of a company smartly adapting to the digital
   economy, according to Ravi Mayuram, senior vice president of products
   and engineering at Couchbase.

   It built its retail leadership on brick and mortar but became a
   technology and e-commerce innovator, "establishing itself as an
   influential Silicon Valley leader," he told LinuxInsider.

   Walmart's move will help further the adoption of Couchbase database
   technology. It is one of the primary databases used with OneOps,
   Mayuram said.

   "This will go a long way to making OneOps a world-class operation," he
   added.

Competitive Edge

   Walmart should gain cost savings for development and faster time to
   production. If competing with Amazon is has any part in the picture, it
   will be through cost savings, according to Rob Enderle, principal
   analyst at the [81]Enderle Group.

   "This is new to them, so there will likely be a learning curve, and
   this curve may have them run into problems like security risk they are
   not yet equipped to handle," he told LinuxInsider.

   The benefits are the same that any active open source participant
   gains: capturing improvements to the platform that are developed by the
   larger community and enhancing the momentum and longer-term health and
   vitality of their OneOps investment, noted King.

   "The risks seem relatively minimal as the company's investments in
   OneOps have already paid back considerably," he concluded.
