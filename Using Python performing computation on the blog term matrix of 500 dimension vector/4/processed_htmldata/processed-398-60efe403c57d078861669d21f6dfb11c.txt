What It’s Like Now That Even Walmart Has Left McDowell County

   It’s not much to look at now, a Walmart sign that’s been painted black.
   But it’s heartbreaking for Linda McKinney, a McDowell County native who
   sees poverty on a daily basis.

   McKinney knows what it takes to exist in Kimball, a southern coalfield
   community that’s recently lost 13 mines and the good-paying jobs that
   come with them. And now, Walmart is gone too, taking another 140 jobs.
   She knows them through her work at a local food bank.

   Workers used black paint to blot out the sign in the middle of the
   night. Slowly, one letter at a time, Walmart disappeared.

   “They said they wouldn’t put something heavier like plastic over it
   because the wind would knock it down.”

The corporate retail giant’s arrival ten years ago brought massive changes to
this community.

   Sure, some small, mom-and-pop stores shuttered, but Walmart offered
   lower prices and services the community would come to depend upon.

   For example, Wal-Mart’s pharmacy provided people without prescription
   drug coverage generic medicine for less than $10 a month. Even having
   motorized wheelchairs so that special-needs customers could shop
   comfortably in a handicap-accessible store was a new convenience.

   With Wal-Mart’s sudden departure—the chain announced the move less than
   a month before the closure—the community again is bracing for massive
   change. It came as part of a corporate announcement that 269
   under-performing locations were being closed nationally and
   internationally.

     Walmart's closing 154 stores.

     The most affected will be the poor, rural
     areas:[9]https://t.co/KVFeJbb46X [10]pic.twitter.com/rD4ylehIDg

     — Jess Ramirez (@journalistnotes) [11]February 6, 2016

   “How are people on oxygen going to get their groceries, much less even
   shop?” McKinney said.

   McDowell County Chamber of Commerce Manager Betty Jones said the
   store’s closing sends an ominous message to residents who are now
   fearful about living in a community that can’t support a Walmart.

   “When you add in all the mines that have been closing, this is really a
   blow. And we had more mom-and-pop shops before Walmart, but of course
   we don’t have a lot of them left now. It really rooted them out,” Jones
   said.

   Across town, office assistant Pam Akers, who works for the City of
   Welch, knows plenty of local residents who blame the federal
   government’s “war on coal” for their hometown’s predicament.

   “We’re just getting slammed every which way we go, and it is very
   disheartening,” she said.

   They also don’t appreciate how Walmart’s decision has
   disproportionately impacted smaller communities, Akers said, recalling
   a news story about a North Carolina town that lost nearly all of its
   local businesses after the company arrived.

   “Now the people in [that] community have to go out of town just to buy
   an onion. It’s just so sad.”

“When you consider that you lose 1.5 jobs for every one created by Walmart,
it’s finally going to catch up to you, so this is a big deal on a lot of
different levels for our community.”

   McDowell County residents will have to travel about an hour each way,
   over dangerous mountain roads, to reach the closest Walmart in
   Bluefield, Virginia. They will likely have to make this trek on a
   regular basis to get items not available at the only two remaining
   local stores, Goodsons’ and Magic Mart, in Welch.

   “I’m just heartbroken to think about the others—elderly and people who
   just don’t have a vehicle or the money—to make this kind of trip on a
   regular basis like they will need to do,” McKinney said. Not to mention
   winter weather sometimes makes the roads impassable.

   The move was especially painful since it was a major donor to the Five
   Loaves and Two Fishes Food Bank, said McKinney, who oversees the
   nonprofit’s operation.

   “We were allowed to go to Walmart three days a week, and last year we
   processed 90,000 pounds of food from there, everything from meat and
   produce to any of their bakery goods. And a lot of times they would
   call because they had an overage on their milk, so we’d go and get
   their extra dairy, too. I’d say over the years it was probably worth
   millions because of how much food they gave us,” McKinney said.
   via

   One third of the food distributed by Five Loaves & Two Fishes Food Bank
   came from Walmart before the store’s closure (via [12]Facebook)

   It was a shock when news broke that the store was closing. Local
   employees including the manager, who was called in from vacation,
   evidently had no advance knowledge of the move.

   “For two days, I just didn’t know what to think because all I could
   think about was how I was going to feed my people. But God will
   provide, even if we don’t have any more chicken or roast beef to hand
   out,” she said. In fact, donations have already arrived as out-of-state
   folks and organizations heard about the food bank’s void due to
   Walmart’s departure.

   Even before Walmart’s closure, people lined up before dawn to wait for
   the food bank to open. McKinney isn’t sure what to expect for the Feb.
   20 distribution.

Last year the organization served 11,000 people, half of the county’s entire
population, including approximately 4,000 families.

   Approximately one third of the 300,000 pounds of food that was
   distributed came from Walmart.

   Although rural poverty can sometimes be “out of sight, out of mind,”
   that’s not how things are in McDowell communities.

   “Driving through here you will see dilapidated houses with people
   living in them, a lot of structures that should have already been
   abandoned but families are still hanging on there. In the small towns,
   you usually see people just hanging on the streets or on the corner
   because there’s nothing else to do,” she said.

   Imagine not even having running water relying instead on local springs.

   “We’ve been here working all day and we’ve had a lot of people come by
   just looking for bottled water,” she said.

   Sadly it’s not likely to get better soon. Norfolk Southern Railroad
   plans to close its yard in Bluefield due in large part to the state’s
   declining coal industry.

   Other problems including rampant drug abuse and a continuing lack of
   even basic infrastructure, like good roads and public utilities to
   provide water and sewer service, make it even harder to recruit new
   employers to the area.

But there are some who refuse to give up.

   McKinney’s family is not giving up on McDowell County. They believe
   education is the key to a brighter tomorrow. They are actively working
   to introduce local folks to the science of hydroponics which uses water
   to grow crop plants.

   Additionally, a [13]GoFundMe page has been established to help raise
   the $15,000 needed to purchase a special kind of greenhouse that will
   allow vegetables, fruits and even herbs to be grown throughout most of
   the year.

   “McDowell County has been good to me and my family, so there is no way
   I’m going to stop helping other people. I won’t let them go hungry,
   because feeding people is in my heart and my heart is here,” McKinney
   said.

   No stranger to hard times, Akers too said she’ll gladly stay here
   because this is home.

   “You know how some people say that the last person out should turn out
   the lights, well I’m going to be there making sure the light stays on
   here,” Akers said.

   As for that black-out Walmart sign, McKinney wishes it wasn’t there but
   she’s also taking action into her own hands. “I have already called the
   city because I want to go and plant some flowers under the sign and
   beautify it the best I can.”
