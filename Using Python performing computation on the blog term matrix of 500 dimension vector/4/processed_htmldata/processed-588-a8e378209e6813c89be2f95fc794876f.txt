White Nationalist Supporters Are Undeterred By Trump's Iowa Caucus Loss

   The founder of a white nationalist super PAC that launched a robocall
   campaign for Donald Trump in Iowa is undeterred by his favored
   candidate's second-place finish, and plans to move forward with another
   robocall campaign to get out the vote for Trump in New Hampshire.

   William Johnson, chairman of the white nationalist American Freedom
   Party and founder of the American National Super PAC, told TPM in a
   Tuesday phone interview that he believes Trump is “well-placed to move
   forward in the other primaries.”

   Johnson said Iowa caucus winner Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) simply “had a
   longer-term ground game in a state that is amenable to ground games.
   And Trump didn’t have that involvement in the state.”

   Johnson's PAC made national headlines in January after it [41]rolled
   out a robocall campaign in the Hawkeye State that lavished praise on
   Trump’s anti-immigrant policy proposals. The call featured endorsements
   from a Filipino-American minister, Rev. Donald Tan, and Jared Taylor,
   the founder of the white supremacist American Renaissance magazine.

   “We don’t need Muslims," Taylor said on the robocall. "We need smart,
   well-educated white people who will assimilate to our culture. Vote
   Trump.”

   When asked about the campaign in late January, Trump, who is not
   affiliated with the American National Super PAC, [42]told CNN he “would
   disavow” the robocalls. But he added that he wasn't surprised by their
   content.

   “Nothing in this country shocks me. I would disavow it, but nothing in
   this country shocks me," he said.

   Trump explained the calls by repeating his claims that undocumented
   immigrants commit crimes against U.S. citizens.

   "People are angry, they're angry at what's going on," he continued.
   "They're angry at the border. They're angry at the crime. They're angry
   at people coming in and shooting Kate [Steinle] in the back in
   California, in San Francisco. They're angry when Jamiel Shaw was shot
   in the face by an illegal immigrant. They're angry when the woman, the
   veteran, 65 years old, is raped, sodomized, and killed by an illegal
   immigrant.”

   In a Tuesday phone interview with TPM, Taylor noted that Trump's
   explanation dovetailed nicely with the white nationalist views espoused
   by the super PAC.

   “He didn’t put it in racial terms when he was asked to disavow the
   calls,” Taylor said. “He said people are furious about some of the
   immigrants who come in illegally and commit all sorts of problems. He
   is expressing sympathy not with the consciousness of race and the wish
   of whites to remain the majority; what he’s expressing solidarity with
   is the idea that we shouldn’t be letting in immigrants who are going to
   kill us and commit crimes. But in many respects it boils down to the
   same thing as a practical matter.”

   Numerous [43]studies, including one released last summer by the
   non-partisan [44]American Immigration Council, have found that
   undocumented immigrants are actually less likely to commit serious
   crimes than U.S.-born citizens.

   Taylor, who said he sees race as “the most difficult social fault line
   to try to paper over,” accused liberals of embracing the rhetoric of
   diversity while segregating themselves in practice. He pointed to the
   Clintons as a prime example, saying Chappaqua, New York, where Bill and
   Hillary Clinton own a home, is “about as white a place as you can find
   outside of Iceland.”

   “Look at the people who shout the most about the benefits of
   diversity—they tend to be elites whose lives are practically untouched
   by diversity,” he argued. “They all say, ‘Oh diversity is a great
   strength, it’s a wonderful thing. But we will forgo it so a few working
   class slobs can live next to people who play Ranchero music ‘til 3 in
   the morning and who get to send their children to schools where they
   spend more time trying to teach English to foreign language speakers
   than teaching arithmetic.’"

   Taylor said the people who actually experience—or, in his words,
   "suffer from"— diversity "are behind the kind of support that Trump,
   and to some extent Cruz, are getting.”

   Neither Johnson nor Taylor said they view Cruz as a viable alternative
   to Trump, despite his win in Iowa and his [45]similarly strong rhetoric
   about undocumented immigrants and refugees from Muslim countries.

   “I don’t support Cruz for a variety of reasons,” Johnson said. “Cruz is
   a conservative and I’m a populist and a nationalist…Cruz is just not
   the man for the job so I would not support him at all.”

   As for Taylor, he said he admires Trump’s “less politically correct
   instincts” and trusts him to not compromise on his positions if
   elected.

   “I can imagine Donald Trump saying something like, 'What’s wrong with
   white people preferring to remain the majority in the United States?'"
   Taylor said. "I can’t imagine Ted Cruz saying something like this."

   In Taylor's mind, Cruz has simply modeled his increasingly hardline
   stance on immigration off Trump’s.

   “I prefer the original rather than the imitation,” he said.
