New Hampshire Republicans Are Really, Really Anti-Science

Why a climate change denier will almost certainly win Tuesday's GOP primary.

   At a campaign stop in Henniker, New Hampshire, last week, Ted Cruz was
   asked what he'd do as president to combat climate change. Cruz's
   answer—an [33]eight-minute rant that you can watch below—was
   essentially that he would do nothing—because global warming isn't
   happening. It's "the perfect pseudoscientific theory" to justify
   liberal politicians' quest to expand "government power over the
   American citizenry," he said.

   Like Cruz, the two GOP front-runners in the state—[35]Donald Trump and
   [36]Marco Rubio—[37]reject mainstream climate science. Trump [38]has
   repeatedly called global warming a "hoax," and [39]Rubio has said, "I
   do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to
   our climate the way these scientists are portraying it." John Kasich,
   who's been rising in the New Hampshire polls in recent weeks, has made
   a number of [40]contradictory comments about climate change.
   "It's almost a litmus test in the Republican Party that you have to
   reject climate science."

   New Hampshire is a famously moderate swing state. [41]Fifty-five
   percent of the state's residents believe that humans are warming the
   planet, according to polling by the Yale Project on Climate Change
   Communication. Kelly Ayotte, New Hampshire's Republican US senator,
   [42]agrees, and she recently bucked her party by [43]supporting
   President Barack Obama's new regulations restricting power plant
   emissions. Since 2009, New Hampshire has been part of a [44]regional
   cap-and-trade program designed to limit carbon pollution.

   So will Trump, Rubio, and Cruz's extreme views on climate hurt them in
   New Hampshire? Probably not, at least not among the voters who will
   likely decide Tuesday's primary. Ayotte's position on the issue may
   align with the state as a whole, but among Republican voters climate
   change denial is extremely common.

   "Rejecting climate science is pretty much mainstream" within the New
   Hampshire GOP, says Lawrence Hamilton, a University of New Hampshire
   sociologist who studies environmental public opinion. "It's almost a
   litmus test in the Republican Party that you have to reject climate
   science."

   Take a look at the chart below, which shows data compiled by Hamilton
   and his colleagues as part of the University of New Hampshire's Granite
   State Poll. The orange line represents self-identified tea party
   supporters in the state, and the red line represents non-tea-party
   Republicans. The results are pretty striking. Even among the state's
   non-tea-party Republicans, only about 40 percent believe that climate
   change is mainly caused by human activity, according to the most recent
   survey. And among tea party supporters—who, [45]according to exit
   polling, made up 51 percent of voters in the state's 2012 GOP
   primary—that number drops below 30 percent.

   Not only are New Hampshire's Republican voters skeptical of climate
   science, [46]many of them say [PDF] they simply don't trust what
   scientists say about global warming (or vaccines, for that matter).
   This attitude tracks closely with the anti-scientist rhetoric employed
   by a number of Republican politicians. Trump, for instance, [47]once
   said that "the scientists are having a lot of fun" perpetrating the
   climate "hoax."
   climate opinion
   Lawrence Hamilton/UNH

   Back in September, the University of New Hampshire asked supporters of
   each of the presidential candidates whether they believed humans were
   causing climate change. Because the GOP field is so splintered, many of
   the sample sizes for this question were small, which means the margins
   of error were enormous. Still, the chart below gives you some sense of
   the situation. At the time, Trump and Fiorina were the two
   front-runners in the state, and roughly a third of their supporters
   said they accepted the scientific consensus on climate change. The rest
   of the Republicans were all polling in the single digits. Kasich was
   the only Republican with a majority of supporters saying they believed
   in human-caused global warming. (According to Hamilton, Cruz was
   polling so poorly at the time that any similar analysis of his voters
   wouldn't be very meaningful.) Meanwhile, the vast majority of Hillary
   Clinton's and Bernie Sanders' supporters embraced the scientific
   consensus.

   Here's one final chart from Hamilton's research illustrating just how
   extreme New Hampshire's GOP voters are when it comes to climate change.
   [48]The University of New Hampshire asked respondents whether they
   believed that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the Earth's
   atmosphere had increased in recent decades. This shouldn't be a
   controversial issue. Scientists [49]have daily measurements showing
   that CO2—the primary driver of global warming—has been steadily rising
   for years. But somehow, fewer than half of those who said they would
   support Trump in a hypothetical matchup against Sanders agreed with
   this indisputable scientific fact.

   Lawrence Hamilton/UNH

   These voters have an "ideological way of knowing that trumps science,"
   said Hamilton.

   That's bad news for the climate change debate in this country. But it's
   very good news for Trump, Rubio, and Cruz.
