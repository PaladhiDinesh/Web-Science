   The Republican candidate running for President of the US, Donald Trump,
   was included on the list of nominees for the Nobel Peace Prize, along
   with Pope Francis and Edward Snowden.
   Donald Trump

   ([126]Newswire.net -- February 8, 2016) -- Kristian Berg Harpviken, an
   observer at the Nobel Committee and director of the Institute for Peace
   Research in Oslo, told Reuters that also on the list of candidates for
   the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize are Colombian peace negotiators, US
   Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz, and Chairman of the Iranian Atomic
   Energy Organization, Ali Akbar Salehi.

   Harpviken claims that he has had access to a letter from an unnamed
   American promoter.

   Trump was proposed for this award because of his energetic commitment
   to peace through strong ideology, which is used as a weapon against
   radical Islam, ISIS, nuclear Iran and communist China, explained
   Kristian Berg Harpviken.

   However, the observer at the Nobel Committee does not believe that
   Donald Trump is likely to be declared the winner of the Nobel Prize.

   Thousands of candidates are entitled to be nominated per year for the
   Nobel Peace Prize. The Norwegian Nobel Committee receiveds more than
   200 nominations a year.

   Some of the recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize are Theodore Roosevelt,
   Martin Luther King Jr, the Red Cross, UNICEF, Mother Teresa, Elie
   Wiesel, Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev, Nelson Mandela, Yitzhak Rabin,
   Shimon Peres, Jimmy Carter, Al Gore, and President Barack Obama in
   2009.

   The Nobel Peace Prize is one of five Nobel Prizes created by Swedish
   industrialist and inventor Alfred Nobel. He is the founder of the
   prizes in Chemistry, Physics, Physiology or Medicine, and Literature.

   The Nobel Prizes have been awarded annually since 1901 to scientists,
   writers, politicians, doctors, people who have done the most or the
   best in their fields. The prize is awarded on December 10th in Oslo
   City Hall each year.

   The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded to an individual who has achieved most
   in the preservation of world peace, equality among all people, for
   fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of armies
   and for the promotion of peace.

   The recipient is selected by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, a
   five-member committee appointed by the Parliament of Norway.

   It is a great honor to receive this award, but the Nobel Peace Prize
   has been the subject of controversies due to its political nature.
