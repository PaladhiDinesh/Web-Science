Subway’s $6 Footlong Move Could Hurt them with Millennials

   Monday, Feb. 08th, 2016 / By [32]John Dick

   Responsible for one of the catchiest, ubiquitous jingles in recent
   advertising history, Subway’s “$5 Footlong” campaign can trace its
   roots all the way back to 2008. When news broke recently that Subway
   was moving to a new $6 foot-long promotion, [33]industry pundits
   quickly questioned the wisdom of another price-point-based strategy,
   especially with the $5 price so deeply burned into the public
   consciousness.

   We went straight the the U.S. consumer population and asked. Here’s
   what we found:

   Our sample of over 2,300 US adults found that a full 23% of consumers
   expect to reduce their visits to Subway as a result of the new $6
   price. Look what happens to the numbers when we remove people who never
   eat at Subway anyway:

   Over 1/3rd of Subway diners say they will eat there less. Now, in all
   fairness, we do know that people tend to overstate their displeasure
   with price increases, relative to their eventual behavior. But even at
   20 or 25%, that’s a lot of potential attrition.

   And who is Subway most at risk of losing? Bargain-shopping Baby
   Boomers? Family-budget-sensitive GenX moms? Nope. It looks like our
   favorite, QSR-loving Millennials, are most at risk. Take a look.

   olding-prices (1)

   Among Subway diners only, 44% of Millennials say they will patronize
   the establishment less due to the new price. Again, are some of these
   respondents just bitter and likely to suck up the extra $1 the next
   time a Subway is the most convenient place to eat? Probably.  But not
   all of them.

   I’m sure the smart people at Subway know what they’re doing. You can’t
   blame them for raising prices. The fact that they held steady at $5 for
   nearly 8 years is impressive in its own right. So, I’m sure they have
   other strategies for wooing their loyal diners, especially the younger
   ones. We know from our other research that Millennials value speed and
   atmosphere in their restaurant choices, as well as the portability of
   food items – things they can eat with one hand while staring at their
   phones. Perhaps we should look for those kinds of moves from Subway in
   the future, especially if this $6 footlong promotion falls flat.
