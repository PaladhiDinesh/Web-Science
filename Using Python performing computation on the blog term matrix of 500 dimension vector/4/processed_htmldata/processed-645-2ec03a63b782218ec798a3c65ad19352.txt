   Donald Trump would have no trouble [6]turning away Syrian refugee
   children in the most personal way possible:

     "I can look at their faces and say you can't come," Trump replied.
     "We don't know where their parents come from. They have no
     documentation."

   They have no documentation because they’re fleeing civil war and
   terrorism, but screw ‘em. Donald Trump is man enough to reject children
   to their faces, leaving them in whatever horrific conditions they may
   face.
