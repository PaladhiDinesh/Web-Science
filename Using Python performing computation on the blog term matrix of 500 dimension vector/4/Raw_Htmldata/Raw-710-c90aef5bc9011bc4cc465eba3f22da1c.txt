(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)[/caption]\r\n\r\nDonald Trump&rsquo;s appeal is said to be his straight talk. But when it comes to international trade, he sounds like a hypocrite, the classic &ldquo;Do what I say, not what I do&rdquo; politician.\r\n\r\nWhile bashing companies for investing in foreign countries, Donald Trump&rsquo;s own company has shown no inclination to invest and build only in America. In fact, a significant percentage of his company&rsquo;s hotels and major real estate properties are located abroad.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Trump is either inexcusably hypocritical or inexcusably ignorant of economics,&rdquo; according to Donald J. Boudreaux, a professor of economics at George Mason University. &ldquo;There is zero economic difference between, say, a U.S. car company's investments abroad in factories and Mr. Trump's own investments abroad in hotels: both are meant to improve the bottom line of companies headquartered in the U.S. by taking advantage of profitable economic opportunities outside of the U.S.\"\r\n\r\nYet a staple of Trump the candidate&rsquo;s speeches has been to bash Ford Motor for building a plant in Mexico. &ldquo;Trump has repeatedly said that if elected, he would not allow Ford to open a new plant in Mexico,&rdquo; reported the <a href=\"http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2015/08/12/trump-autos/31589899/\"><em>Detroit News</em></a>. &ldquo;At his campaign announcement speech in New York in June, Trump said he would call [Ford CEO Mark] Fields to explain the &lsquo;bad news.&rsquo;&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Let me give you the bad news: Every car, every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we&rsquo;re going to charge you a 35% tax,&rdquo; Trump said. &ldquo;They are going to take away thousands of jobs.\"\r\n\r\nThe <em>Detroit News</em> noted, &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t clear how Trump could legally single out one automaker for punitive taxes.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nFord spokesman Karl Henkel said: &ldquo;Mark [Fields] sent Mr. Trump an email with information about Ford, including the $6.2 billion we have invested in our U.S. plants since 2011 and our hiring of nearly 25,000 U.S. employees.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;When it comes to political hypocrisy, Donald Trump deserves a gold medal,&rdquo; said Mark J. Perry, a professor of economics and finance at the University of Michigan-Flint and creator of the economics blog Carpe Diem. &ldquo;At the same time that the billionaire businessman criticizes Ford for producing some of its cars in Mexico, and threatens to stop any expansion there and impose a 35% tax on Ford imports from Mexico, he certainly has no trouble taking advantage of the global marketplace when it comes to his own businesses.&rdquo;\r\n<!--donotpaginate-->\r\nPerry notes Trump has imported clothing from China and Mexico produced for his brand. &ldquo;For Trump to operate, outsource and invest globally while criticizing companies like Ford for doing the same is the ultimate hypocrisy. To be fair to Ford, Trump should either agree to impose a 35% tax on Trump Collection clothing and agree to stop investing overseas, or he should stop his threats against Ford for operating as a global carmaker.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAs economists such as Don Boudreaux and Mark Perry point out, there is no real difference between a U.S. car company investing in a foreign country and a real estate company building a hotel or office building in a foreign country.\r\n\r\nUnder &ldquo;Our Hotels&rdquo; on the <a href=\"https://www.trumphotelcollection.com/trump-hotels-ppc.php?_vsrefdom=corporate-ppc&amp;rt=google%7Ccpc%7CTHC01-Trump-Hotels-Corporate-2015-Brand%7Ctrump%20hotels&amp;gclid=CLPAidL3q8cCFY-HaQodVwIOwg\">Trump Hotel Collection website</a>, it lists six&nbsp;domestic hotels and six&nbsp;international hotels. Is the problem Ford is building something in Latin America? Well, there are Trump hotels in Panama and Rio de Janeiro. The other hotels abroad are in Toronto, Doonbeg, Ireland, Vancouver, and Baku, Azerbaijan. (Toronto and Vancouver also have a Trump Tower.)\r\n\r\nOn the website for the <a href=\"http://www.trump.com/Real_Estate_Portfolio/Real_Estate_Portfolio/Real_Estate_Portfolio.asp\">Trump Real Estate Collection</a>, nine&nbsp;international properties are listed, including two Trump Towers in India and one in Istanbul, another in Uruguay and another in the Philippines, as well as a Trump World in South Korea, among others.\r\n\r\nIf one argued the way Donald Trump argues on the campaign trail, then one could say that Donald Trump is costing America jobs by building hotels and commercial real estate in foreign countries instead of in the United States. In theory, the same money used to build and staff more than a dozen properties abroad could have supported thousands of jobs in America.\r\n\r\nDonald Trump and his executive team believed a better use of the company&rsquo;s capital was to invest its money abroad rather in the United States and that those investments in foreign countries would be more profitable.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing wrong with the company Donald Trump leads investing in other countries. However, there is something wrong when he attacks the head of another company for doing the same.\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Also on Forbes:</strong></em>\r\n\r\n[gallery2012]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;</p>","description":"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)</p> \n</div>\n<p>Donald Trump’s appeal is said to be his straight talk. But when it comes to international trade, he sounds like a hypocrite, the classic “Do what I say, not what I do” politician.</p>\n<p>While bashing companies for investing in foreign countries, Donald Trump’s own company has shown no inclination to invest and build only in America. In fact, a significant percentage of his company’s hotels and major real estate properties are located abroad.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Trump is either inexcusably hypocritical or inexcusably ignorant of economics,” according to Donald J. Boudreaux, a professor of economics at George Mason University. “There is zero economic difference between, say, a U.S. car company’s investments abroad in factories and Mr. Trump’s own investments abroad in hotels: both are meant to improve the bottom line of companies headquartered in the U.S. by taking advantage of profitable economic opportunities outside of the U.S.”</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>Yet a staple of Trump the candidate’s speeches has been to bash Ford Motor for building a plant in Mexico. “Trump has repeatedly said that if elected, he would not allow Ford to open a new plant in Mexico,” reported the <a href=\"http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2015/08/12/trump-autos/31589899/\"><em>Detroit News</em></a>. “At his campaign announcement speech in New York in June, Trump said he would call [Ford CEO Mark] Fields to explain the ‘bad news.’”</p>\n<p>“Let me give you the bad news: Every car, every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we’re going to charge you a 35% tax,” Trump said. “They are going to take away thousands of jobs.”</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>The <em>Detroit News</em> noted, “It isn’t clear how Trump could legally single out one automaker for punitive taxes.”</p>\n<p>Ford spokesman Karl Henkel said: “Mark [Fields] sent Mr. Trump an email with information about Ford, including the $6.2 billion we have invested in our U.S. plants since 2011 and our hiring of nearly 25,000 U.S. employees.”</p>\n<p>“When it comes to political hypocrisy, Donald Trump deserves a gold medal,” said Mark J. Perry, a professor of economics and finance at the University of Michigan-Flint and creator of the economics blog Carpe Diem. “At the same time that the billionaire businessman criticizes Ford for producing some of its cars in Mexico, and threatens to stop any expansion there and impose a 35% tax on Ford imports from Mexico, he certainly has no trouble taking advantage of the global marketplace when it comes to his own businesses.”</p>\n<p>Perry notes Trump has imported clothing from China and Mexico produced for his brand. “For Trump to operate, outsource and invest globally while criticizing companies like Ford for doing the same is the ultimate hypocrisy. To be fair to Ford, Trump should either agree to impose a 35% tax on Trump Collection clothing and agree to stop investing overseas, or he should stop his threats against Ford for operating as a global carmaker.”</p>\n<p>As economists such as Don Boudreaux and Mark Perry point out, there is no real difference between a U.S. car company investing in a foreign country and a real estate company building a hotel or office building in a foreign country.</p>\n<p>Under “Our Hotels” on the <a href=\"https://www.trumphotelcollection.com/trump-hotels-ppc.php?_vsrefdom=corporate-ppc&amp;rt=google%7Ccpc%7CTHC01-Trump-Hotels-Corporate-2015-Brand%7Ctrump%20hotels&amp;gclid=CLPAidL3q8cCFY-HaQodVwIOwg\">Trump Hotel Collection website</a>, it lists six&nbsp;domestic hotels and six&nbsp;international hotels. Is the problem Ford is building something in Latin America? Well, there are Trump hotels in Panama and Rio de Janeiro. The other hotels abroad are in Toronto, Doonbeg, Ireland, Vancouver, and Baku, Azerbaijan. (Toronto and Vancouver also have a Trump Tower.)</p>\n<p>On the website for the <a href=\"http://www.trump.com/Real_Estate_Portfolio/Real_Estate_Portfolio/Real_Estate_Portfolio.asp\">Trump Real Estate Collection</a>, nine&nbsp;international properties are listed, including two Trump Towers in India and one in Istanbul, another in Uruguay and another in the Philippines, as well as a Trump World in South Korea, among others.</p>\n<p>If one argued the way Donald Trump argues on the campaign trail, then one could say that Donald Trump is costing America jobs by building hotels and commercial real estate in foreign countries instead of in the United States. In theory, the same money used to build and staff more than a dozen properties abroad could have supported thousands of jobs in America.</p>\n<p>Donald Trump and his executive team believed a better use of the company’s capital was to invest its money abroad rather in the United States and that those investments in foreign countries would be more profitable.</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with the company Donald Trump leads investing in other countries. However, there is something wrong when he attacks the head of another company for doing the same.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Also on Forbes:</strong></em></p>\n<div class=\"article-gallery-embedded\" data-url=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/eeeh45kfh/sen-ted-cruz-r-tx/\"> \n <div class=\"embedded-content clearfix\"> \n  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/eeeh45kfh/sen-ted-cruz-r-tx/\" class=\"clearfix\" target=\"_self\"> \n   <div class=\"article-image-box\"> \n    <!--start:main_image--> \n    <img src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/470246464/400x400.jpg?fit=scale&amp;background=000000\" alt=\"\" /> \n    <!--end:main_image--> \n   </div> \n   <div class=\"article-text-box\"> \n    <header> \n     <i class=\"icon icon-gallery\"></i>Gallery \n    </header> \n    <h4>Election 2016: Who's Running?</h4> \n    <div class=\"article-launch-gallery\"> \n     <span class=\"article-launch-text\">Launch Gallery</span> \n     <div class=\"article-slide-count\">\n       21 images \n     </div> \n    </div> \n    <button class=\"article-launch-button\"><i class=\"icon icon-chevron-right\"></i></button> \n   </div></a> \n </div> \n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"],"galleryId":"55842b06e4b017853ecee432","disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"doNotPaginate":true,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_6","channelName":"Leadership","url":"/leadership","displayName":"Leadership"},{"id":"channel_6section_44","channelName":"Leadership","sectionName":"Leaders","url":"/leaders","displayName":"Leaders"}],"pTagCount":0,"allIndividualAuthors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/3501","name":"Stuart Anderson","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e352ace1fc7cac611bde569416fa939f?s=40&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":62,"image":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e352ace1fc7cac611bde569416fa939f?s=62&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":136,"image":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e352ace1fc7cac611bde569416fa939f?s=136&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":400,"image":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e352ace1fc7cac611bde569416fa939f?s=400&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/","type":"Contributor","profileUrl":"/sites/stuartanderson/","authorType":"individual","email":"stuart@nfap.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I write about globalization, business, technology and immigration.","amazon":"http://www.amazon.com/Immigration-Greenwood-Guides-Business-Economics/dp/0313380287/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1365730925&sr=8-1&keywords=anderson+immigration","webSite":"http://www.nfap.com","timestamp":1459780861462,"description":"I am the Executive Director of the National Foundation for American Policy, a non-partisan public policy research organization focusing on trade, immigration and related issues based in Arlington, Virginia.
