My first task is to find top 3 favorite and bottom 3 favorite films for three users who are closest to me in terms of age,gender and occupation.
In order to do this I first collected data from u.data, u.user and u.item. Sample files for all these 3 are shown in fig\ref{Sample_list1}, fig\ref{Sample_list2} and fig\ref{Sample_list3}.
The sample combined data can be seen in fig\ref{Sample_list4}.
I took this data and then found users who are similar to me in terms of age,gender and occupation and this list can be found in fig\ref{Sample_list5}.
I got 6 users who are similar to me and I choosed 3 users randomly and their user_id's are 135, 391 and 706.
Now for each of this user I need to find out their top 3 favorite films and bottom 3 favorite films using the ratings given by them.
I have written code for this and this can be seen in listing\ref{lst:q1-1}.
I got 3 top and bottom favorite films for each user and this can be seen in fig\ref{output1}.
I chose user with user_id = ``706'' as my substitute because my interest matched with him. Even I like star wars and Edge and but I am not interested in Phenomenon and I do not like Game, Fargo and Crash. 
So user with user_id =1``706''  is my substitute.

In this question I need to find out 5 users who are most and least correlated to my substitute.
For doing this I used some function from recommendations.py as reference taken from a book called ``Programming Collective Intelligence.''
I used u.data file and sent it as input to my program to get the solution. The program can be found in listing\ref{lst:q2-1}.
For doing this I need to find the sim pearson's coefficient which for each user.
If the coefficient for each user is 1 or nearer to 1, then that user is most correlated to my substitute and if the coefficient is negative then that user is least correlated to my substitute.
I found the top 5 most correlated users and bottom 5 least correlated users which can be seen in fig\ref{Sample_t2}.
First column represent the value of coefficient followed by user_id.

Here I need to compute the ratings for the films my substitute has not seen. Now I need find out top 5 and bottom 5 recommendations for films that my substitute should see.
The bottom 5 recommendations are the films my substitute hate to see.
I have found these recommendations using a function called ``getRecommendations'' from recommendations.py.
The program for this question can be found in listing\ref{lst:q3-1}.
This function gives me a list of movies and their rating. These are recommendations for my substitute.
But all these are not considered as output, only the top 5 that is movies with rating as 5 are chosen and bottom 5 that is movies with rating  as 1 are chosen.
So these top 5 movies are recommended to my substitute expecting that he/she likes them.
The output file showing movie names and their ratings can be seen in fig\ref{Sample3_t3}.

I need to choose my top favorite and least favorite movies from u.item file. For each of this film I need to find out top 5 most correlated and bottom 5 least correlated films and for that I need to give my comments.
I have chosen ``Die Hard (1988)'' as my top favorite film and ``Kazaam (1996)'' as my least favorite film.
Now I have used functions from recommendations.py to compute the top 5 correlated and least 5 correlated films.
I have used loadMovieLens, transformPrefs and topMatches functions from recommendations.py.
This in turn uses sim pearson's coefficient for getting correlation.
If the coefficient for each film is 1 or nearer to 1, then that film is most correlated to my film and if the coefficient is negative then that user is least correlated to my film.
The program for this can be found in listing\ref{lst:q4-2}.
Recommendations.py program can be seen in listing\ref{lst:q4-1}.
The output file showing sim pearson's coefficient and movie names can be seen in the fig\ref{graph41}.
