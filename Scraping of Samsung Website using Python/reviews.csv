Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone! Still working through all of the new options.:I am very pleased with my new Samsung 7. My Samsung 4 was still working , but the charging port was damaged so I had no option but purchase another phone. At this point, I am very satisified with all of the options, but still learning. I will be returning to the nearby Verizon store to get help figuring out several adjust to.items but overall, the phone is fairly easy to:2017-04-25:2088189271

Samsung Galaxy S7:Mary's New Phone:Like the Auto application that I can use on my Ford Focus.  Appreciate the long battery life. Like the larger size.:2017-04-18:MG phone
Samsung Galaxy S7:Takes Great Pictures:I take a lot of photography with a Nikon, and I found the pictures I took with this camera did not need any additional processing i.e. lightroom. I would recommend an sd card to store your photos so you don't have to fill up the memory in the phone:2017-04-17:kdscot1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features:Fast response, decent speakers,great features  Battery life  could be better. Decent  camera. Overall a great phone. I would  recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a new phone.:2017-04-17:Jkboy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Features!  I've had a Galaxy S2, S5 and now the S7.  Wouldn't have anything but Samsung:So easy to learn to use.  So many advancements since the Galaxy S2.  Many features are a simple one-click.:2017-04-17:SalVV
Samsung Galaxy S7:The same as my last phone!:Simple to use, great audio and I love it, just like my last one! I really with someone would design a battery that kept it's charge longer!  How about solar powered??:2017-04-16:RARM
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good looking phone:I like the fact that it charges very quickly. I chose the gold which I love. I wish it had more of a variety of ringtones to choose from.:2017-04-16:Ronnie17
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition from Galaxy 3.:Easy transition from Galaxy 3. Data transfer from old device to new device was smooth. New functionality not too difficult to master.:2017-04-16:Kwisman3
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very nice phone, with excellent features.:I have not had this new phone for more than One week, And have not been disappointed so far. I like this phone much better than my old Galaxy-S4.:2017-04-16:Silent type
Samsung Galaxy S7:Similar to my old s4 but is a lot faster!:"The basic operation of the phone is enough like my old s4 that there was no learning curve.  I updated to Android 7.0 a day after I got the phone which presented more of a challenge than the hardware.  I haven't explored the new features of the camera yet but on the whole it is a better version of the s4 I have been using for 3 years.  (Note to Samsung: put the on/off button on the top of the phone.  It is too easy to hit it accidentally.)  Also I miss the replaceable battery.  Hope I don't have a really expensive brick with a 5 minute battery life in 18 months!":2017-04-15:KGB409

Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesome:The phone is really awesome with cool apps. It is really thin and fits great in my pocket. The internet is really fast and it takes great pictures, even in the dark.:2017-04-13:Talkingshermo
Samsung Galaxy S7:Went from the S4 to the S7.:I was in no doubt in need of an update. My old phone was the S4, a week before the S5 came out all those years ago. I needed a new cellphone and decided to still stick with the Galaxy and merely got the S7. It's easy to transition to, it was simple to use, and I'm already use to the new features. The battery will easily last me throughout my day without me charging it, going from 8am in the morning until around 1am the next, still having around 20% left even after constant use.:2017-04-13:SeroLeir
Samsung Galaxy S7:Slick and great features:"'Just upgraded from a 3-year-old Android...such an improvement, especially the speed of the system and the camera.  The battery was being used very quickly until the ""performance mode"" was changed, from ""high performance"" to ""optimized""  - thus saving battery power - so I'd recommend doing this unless you need, i.e., everything running on your device or things like having the brightest screen at all times.  This phone can also be charged ""wirelessly"" with a wireless charger that you place the phone on - no connection needed!  Have only had the phone 1 week but am happy so far.  Only negative is the high cost of this device and lack of a 2-year contract, which used to keep the price down.":2017-04-13:JC 83
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesome phone:Awesome phone and I love Verizon never had any issues and customer service is awesome as well . The inventory they have on phones is great the overall of Verizon is awesome !!!:2017-04-12:Florence jean

Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung S7 solid, well built, looks good.:The Samsung S7 is a very solid, well built, phone.  It's all metal with solid switches. The max microSD cap is 200 GByte, which San Disk produces.  The battery is not replaceable, so getting an ANKER 10000 mAHour external battery was a logical choice for me (this battery is cheap at Amazon). I cannot sort my music by date, cause unknown.  I take the SAME microSD disc with the songs, and insert into the OLD Samsung S4 and sort by date works.  I relocate the disc to the S7, and the sort by date doesn't work correctly.  Phone or PlayerPro? Still, I love the phone.  It's very fast.:2017-04-11:SamsSon
Samsung Galaxy S7:Fantastic Phone!:This is a great phone that does everything!  It takes amazing pictures and with HD Voice and Video Calling, it's like talking with someone face to face.  I optimized the display to preserve on battery, but the quality of the display is still awesome. Insert an SD card to greatly expand storage capacity.  The only negative is syncing email, calendar, and contacts with Exchange is a battery drain.  I had to sync my exchange work email through Gmail, which solved the battery drain problem.:2017-04-10:BonnyS7
Samsung Galaxy S7:Happy with phone:Very happy with my S7. I had an S4 and I was able to transfer 90% of the information I had on my S4 with little to no trouble because of Cloud and direct transfer.:2017-04-10:Apachie14

Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition from my old phone:Coming form a Samsung Galaxy S4 it was an easy transition to the S7.  The camera is exceptional and the other functions are easily used and similar to the S4.  The only con that I have is the curved surface and slim design make it very hard to securely hold the phone.  I definitely recommend getting a protective case for it.:2017-04-06:Gmatt

Samsung Galaxy S7:Love this new phone!:I had had the S4 before getting a new phone, to say I needed and update is an understatement! One of my favorite features is definitely the wireless charging, even through my Otterbox case. Plus, when I called to activate it, customer service champ Eric reviewed my plan and updated me to the Verizon 5 gigs rollover data plan. The phone calls are crystal clear and the video quality is incredible (not a professional though, can't speak to that expertise). Loving it!:2017-03-22:Artemis241

Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone:I have had a Samsung phone since before the Galaxy line existed. I just switched from Sprint after having their service since 1988.

The battery life and camera are both top notch. Internal storage seems average given other options on the market, but the memory is expandable via SD card.

Samsung Galaxy S7:Definitely worth the money:I've had the phone about 2 weeks now, and I'm very happy that I went with this phone. The colors are sharp. The battery lasts all day, even when traveling and using it.  The Gold color is gorgeous! It was VERY simple to transfer all of my old phone to this one, even with switching carriers, I was extremely impressed with that part. I had considered the Edge, but went with this one because I can be a tad clumsy and I'm glad that I did because I've already dropped this one and not caused any damage to it.

Samsung Galaxy S7:Every Samsung Galaxy Gets Better!:The Samsung Galaxy 7 is my third Galaxy phone.  I had the S3 and the S5.  I was happy with all of them, but they improve with with each upgrade.  I am happy with the 32 MB memory, as I had 16MB in the past.  I do not like the non-removable battery.  I hope this battery lasts. I like the time on the lock screen.  And something as small as a small bump on the charging cord that lets me know which way is up when inserting it in the phone in the dark, is a plus for me.  The fast charging is also a plus.  There were no decisions to be be made.  A Samsung 7 was going to be my next phone.:2017-03-07:LindaTea

The back is a little smoother than I would like, but that was fixed with a slim cover to give more traction when holding or pulling out of my pocjet. Overall, really enjoying this phone!:2017-02-17:jake99
Samsung Galaxy S7:All good so far:Got this as an upgrade from my note 4 this phone has a good camera for a phone the internal speaker is weak but I rarely use it for music so that's not a problem. This phone runs smooth no stalling  (if you know how to manage apps and large files on an android device) I have thousands of songs and pictures and hundreds of large pdf files that I use for work on this phone and sd card. No problems yet seems to be a good phone:2017-02-16:farmer5211

And I need to know ho:I need to know how to check my voicemail I haven't figured that out yet. But I like how Verizon is interested in what I think.:2017-02-15:Karen Kay
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone.  Still getting used to it.:I replaced a Note 4 with this phone because, basically, I didn't want to wait for the next Note.  Anyway, so far this phone has been great.  I had some issues with setting it up to run with all my old apps, but, I think I've got it close enough.  Still some alerts and whatnot that aren't working, but, overall a very good phone.:2017-02-15:Mike_Bak

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:This is only my second smart phone. My first was the Galaxy Note II. This is a much faster phone. I did have a problem with the mobile data turning itself off on its own. I turned on developer options and set mobile data to stay on all the time and that fixed it. My only other issue is that I have apps set to update on wifi only and I have to manually update them. They do not update automatically like on my Note II. This might be a Google Play issue though and not a phone issue?:2017-02-14:jab8356

Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy upgrade and great updates on features:The S7 is similar enough to my previous S4 that any operational changes were intuitve.

Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7 Review (less camera, which I haven't used):There was not a great deal of difference between the Galaxy S5 and Galaxy S7, however the small changes were improvements. I haven't explored the camera upgrades yet, so can't comment on that, but overall the difference appears to be  from a very good phone to a better one.:2017-02-09:XXZZZYYY
Samsung Galaxy S7:I'm very happy that I decided not to buy an iPhone 7.:After I bought a Vizio e-series tv, I decided to upgrade my phone, as the Vizio uses apps on the cellphone to control streaming online content. Not only do the two devices function seamlessly together, but compared to my old Samsung Galaxy s3, the s7 is beautiful (the gold-on-platinum finish is so striking, I bought a transparent phone case for it), light, fast, incredibly user-friendly, charges rapidly (less than an hour), and holds a charge throughout a long, busy day. The screen is big without being too big, and for an added bonus, the earbuds included with the phone sound much better than you'd expect, particularly when paired with the Poweramp music player app available on the Google Play Store.:2017-02-08:billybangdouglas
Samsung Galaxy S7:Happy:I love my new phone and would not ever trade it for another divice samsung is an amazing company that knows that people want:2017-02-08:Honeybadgergirl

Samsung Galaxy S7:Keeps getting better:The S7 has new features that make it more convenient and a pleasure to use.  Great job Samsung, keep making those quality products!:2017-02-06:pm293
Samsung Galaxy S7:This Phone Feels SPECIAL.:"I used to have a prepaid phone, because i didn't want to get locked into a ""contract"". However, the amount i paid for the prepaid phone was almost as much as my new phone, and it didn't have any of the incredible features this phone has. From the very beginning, when i was trying to decide between the Galaxy S7 and the Iphone7, which i rather disliked because I'm not a fan of Apple products, it was about which phone was more durable because i work a lot, but I also wanted a phone that felt awesome to own. From the moment they opened up the box to show me the model, this phone just felt SPECIAL! It was different, and it was me all the way. First impression- It came in a smooth, hardcover box that said 32GB right on it, so you know it's got lots of room for apps. and it came with a pair of call receiving enabled headphones, so you can already listen to music and take calls. The phone can take and send video in 4K definition. The phone is compatible with VR technology. This phone is absolutely as smart as they can be and it's also almost completely waterproof, and it's all on the most reliable network (i can get service when i go hunting and fishing in the middle of the woods). What more could you possible need/want?":2017-02-06:Dana44A
Samsung Galaxy S7:My very first smartphone!:Easy to use. I have a Samsung tablet so icons on this phone were familiar. Love the camera,  just in time to take pictures of new grandbaby.:2017-02-06:DCGrammy

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone! Awesome features.:I previously had a S6 phone and liked it very much so it was easy to upgrade to a S7. It has an excellent camera which I was very interested in.:2017-02-03:Marieski
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice upgrade from s4:I have been a galaxy fan for years. Had my s4 since that first came out, and I was hesitant  to upgrade since I liked that one so much. This s7 is way better and faster than the s4 and it was exactly what I was hoping for. The ease of moving pictures and numbers over was much easier than anticipated. Personally, I think for the price of the phone it should have included the wireless charger. This phone was more than my rent, which is probably  another reason I was hesitant  to switch, but I needed a new phone and I am glad it was worth the switch.:2017-02-03:Kelsey8183

Its too big, has no headphone jack so has to worry about losing a stupid cord to attach her earphones when she's at the gym.  And it doesn't compare to the galaxy phones (features aren't as cool) only if you spend extra money on mods:2017-01-30:Heatherl5619

Samsung Galaxy S7:I love Verizon wireless!!!!!!:I have a samsung galaxy s7 and it is so much better then the s5. It's a little bit more bigger and playing games on it is a lot better and not to talk about the gigabytes (32) a lot more then the s5 down side is it doesn't have a place to put an SD card but other then that I would recommend this phone to anyone. Also you will love taking pictures:2017-01-29:Danie2017
Samsung Galaxy S7:Fantastic leap from S4:After spending two comfortable years with the S4, I was apprehensive of having to start all over with a new phone. Enter a wonderful Verizon Rep at the local store who answered all my questions and was there for me when I needed help with a few of the newer bells and whistles. I am one week into the new ownership and am loving it. It's fast, durable, and fun to work with. I love the ease of moving apps from page to page:2017-01-29:vhill1953
Samsung Galaxy S7:Much better than my old iphone:Really happy with the switch to the Samsung Galaxy S7 from my iphone.  It's more logical for me as I come from a Windows and Google background.

Sound quality is great and I can back up my pictures easily into my Google Cloud:2017-01-28:Degg
Samsung Galaxy S7:I love everything about the phone and it's features are easy to understand.:I'm enjoying everything about my phone so much better then the other phones I've ever had through out the years.:2017-01-28:Pszoc71
Samsung Galaxy S7:My favorite phone so far!:Ive had samsung phones pretty much since ive had a cell phone. I switched from the note 5 which i thought was an awesome phone. The camera on this phone is pretty amazing. The pictures are so clear and focused.  Other than that they are pretty similar phones. The only thing that i miss sometimes is the pen, but i still like this phone better!:2017-01-28:Andert19

Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the phone! Hate the battery life!:I went back to the Galaxy S series after a few years with the Motorola Droid. I am completely satisified with everything the phone has to offer except the battery life. I have to charge it atleast twice a day. Thank goodness for the rapid charge feature.  I really don't feel like I use it as much as others but the battery drains really fast. I'm not a big app user. My biggest use is on facebook while looking at pics. However, even being idle at night, it rapidly drains. I've turned off most of my notifications. too.  Anyway, the size is perfect for me - not too big, not too small. It's got everything I need and more.:2017-01-26:ReneeN
Samsung Galaxy S7:great phone...easy to navigate...this is the phone I should have had all al:the product is great...I like the features...and something I have not seen in a while was my being to transfer my information from my old phone...I was very impressed with that feature.

Samsung Galaxy S7:Very easy to transition, it gives more respect to the android product. It doesn't try to mimic other phones, it has its own personality.:Everyone loves apple products, but android does not try to be better, it is better because it's more reliable:2017-01-24:White Lightning

Samsung Galaxy S7:Loved my Windows phone, but this is a great replacement!:"I was a huge fan of the Nokia Lumia line of phones, but Verizon stopped carrying the upgrades for this line, and the selection of Windows apps was dismal. Switching to this phone has been great - there are an indefinite number of apps for Google Play, it's user-friendly, and it has some great capabilities with my Samsung Galaxy Tab A. While I feel that my Nokia Lumia took better nighttime photos, I am overall happy with this phone's camera and the ease with which I can turn data, wifi and location on and off and the ""power save"" mode, all which help save on battery life. There is very little that I miss from my old phone - mostly a couple of games specific to Windows/Xbox. Every app I had on that phone, there are at least 5 similar offerings on Google Play. Also love that it isn't too large for my small girl-hands to hold.":2017-01-22:krystlechc

Samsung Galaxy S7:Easier than iPhone:I'll admit that I'm not very tech savvy and my prior phone (iPhone) really made me feel dumb.  I was always bugging anyone I knew that had one with so many questions.  I counted down the days until I was eligible for an upgrade.  My son and sister both have Samsung phones and had told me on numerous occasions that I would be much happier with one.  I now have the Samsung GalaxyS7 and I love it.

Thanks Verizon at Bowie Town Center!:2017-01-17:MackMD27

Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice!:Finally pulled the trigger and got the upgrade from my S5. Skipped the 6 because I don't like change, but finally I broke my screen and felt it was time. The S7 is really cool, not a huge fan of the price but it's no more expensive than any of the other leading phones I ordered  some of thes and can't wait to see some VR women!:2017-01-16:Bornsavage1983

Samsung Galaxy S7:I'm Back with Verizion !!:My first smart phone was a Motorola Droid. I stayed with that model and stayed up to date with the newer versions as they were released. After 10 yrs I went with the Samsung Galaxy S7. I should have done it sooner. I love the Android OS.:2017-01-15:The Real Tictocdoc

Samsung Galaxy S7:My Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it!  It's  pretty and has great features.  Easy to you for a non techy person.  Meets my needs perfectly.:2017-01-14:Sharp59
Samsung Galaxy S7:Transitioning from the iOS to the Samsung Galaxy s7 was much easier than I initially expected it to be.:This is an amazing phone. First and foremost I love the customizability of it. It's quite literally a personal companion down to the nitty gritty. Transferring information from the iOS was easy too. Unlike iTunes, Samsung is made to be a compatible devise per each individual user. I love this phone. Obviously being waterproof is an outstanding perk. I used to think the battery life of the iOS was something to be proud of, but the galaxy s7 has a tremendous battery life and charges 100% faster. That helps so you don't go to bed with your phone plugged in and when it's done charging it doesn't just continually burn up the battery. You charge it as its needed and that's that. So far I have yet to find anything I dislike about the Samsung Galaxy s7. Highly recommend this phone.:2017-01-14:GoGalaxybyBeefy

Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition form the iPhone 6s:I have had my Galaxy S7 for less then a week now, and I have to admit - for the first 2 or 3 days I was pretty hesitant about keeping it.  However, I am now sold on the phone.  It can do so much more then my previous iPhone 6s and it has a lot more power behind it.    The switch over, which I thought was going to be very difficult, was actually pretty simple, and I was able to do it compleatly from home.  Yes, even switching over my contacts!:2017-01-13:IntrepidSky
Samsung Galaxy S7:I really like the phone. It was a very easy transition to Verizon.:I love the service. The phone is great. I had a s7 before and really like it. The transition to Verizon was great, the only problem is it takes so long to get the gift cards to cover the final bill with Sprint. There's no way they'll wait 8 weeks to get paid.:2017-01-13:3345grapehead
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone!:I bought the phone a week ago, and I am so satisfied with the phone.  Excellent camera, and features.:2017-01-13:Sflores11

Samsung Galaxy S7:Best phone:i just got this phone and it has amazing capabilities and smooth navigation through out the entire phone.:2017-01-12:drbowling31
Samsung Galaxy S7:I Love My Phone!:I got my phone a couple of months ago after upgrading from the Galaxy S5 and have no problems with it. I can go a whole day without charging until night time and then there are days I do have to charge during the day. It all depends on how I use my phone. I have a lot of apps that was transferred from the Galaxy  S5 but haven't activate all of them. If I had activated all of them, then I would be charging my phone twice or more a day.  BTW  I like the new style charger because the the hardly feels hot to the touch.  I do have minor complaints. 1- Not happy with a removable battery. It was the only I could shut off my other phones when they froze. This phone hasn't frozen so far. 2- Being made of glass. More of a risk of being cracked. That was one of the reasons why I didn't want the iPhone. 3- Needs sensitivity touch control when wearing gloves in the winter which they had on the Galaxy S5. 4- Needs voice commands when using a Bluetooth when driving. I had that command when I had a flip phone (I forgot which cell phone company had that. All I had to do was press the button on my Bluetooth and the voice commands came on.) so why can't a smart phone have it without going to the PlayStore and downloading Google Voice? It should be automatically programmed into the phone just like my old flip phone?  Otherwise, I am very happy with the phone. It is very easy to use and Verizonwireless customer service is very helpful when I am in a jam.:2017-01-12:beedee11126
Samsung Galaxy S7:I love my new phone!:Just switched from an iPhone 5c because of all the things I don't like about Apple. Wanted to give Android a try. I'm so glad that I did. I find it so much more user friendly and I'm really happy with it!:2017-01-12:Emma Jane
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features:Absolutely love the color of my Galaxy S7 Edge and the size is perfect The transition from one phone to the next is very simple and easy to manipulate around:2017-01-12:Loop83
Samsung Galaxy S7:Definitely an improvment over my S4.:The S7 is what I wanted when I bought my old S4!  There are several advantages over my old S4. The responsiveness is vastly improved. The extra memory (32G vs 16G) allows for many more apps. I had hit the limit with the S4. The camera works the way that you would expect a good one to work. The one in the S4 was more often than not a disappointment. The S7 camera focuses nearly instantaneously and can be set to track and stay focused on the object (person, hawk flying, etc.). The delay in the S4 was always frustrating and it would often re-focus on the wrong object in the frame.  One thing to be aware of is the need for a good protective cover. The phone is slippery! I purchased a Spigen cover with a protective plastic edge that both looks great and is functional. It does not cover the side buttons. I might switch to one like I had on the S4 that does cover the buttons because it is too easy to accidentally press the power button on the side and wake the phone, but that's in the personal preference area. The cover should have a ridge above the screen because on the S7 the glass sits proud of the edge, exposed in a drop.  The battery life is much better than it is in the S4 as well.  I can say that I haven't found anything negative to report on the S7 itself. I wouldn't have any other.:2017-01-11:dlr77
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone!:This phone has all the features I wanted plus more!  It's very easy to use and I'm very pleased with it.:2017-01-11:Shellybell

I am still learning about all it's features, but I expect to continue to find it a great phone.:2017-01-10:Gaskell23
Samsung Galaxy S7:Functionally equivalent with some extra features - easy change over.:Verizon made it very easy to transition to them from Sprint, and most of the features and apps I used on my S4 appeared on my new phone in a similar fashion to the old one.  The water resistant qualities of the S7 are a nice addition, since I often take my kayaking and hiking in inclement weather.  Signal strength has been better than Sprint in our home, which was an important feature.  We have particularly enjoyed using the phone in the Samsung Gear VR Oculus headset.:2017-01-10:ChrisMFL
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great for our 8 year old!:We bought the gizmo gadget for our 8 year old for Christmas. I wasn't too keen on getting him an actual phone, so this was a great alternative to buy. It works great and,he loves it! I love that I can control it at all times from my phone and can Check his location with GPS! The only con is that there is not an emergency option. You have to enter your local police department's phone number and use that as one of the contacts.:2017-01-10:Stacim18

Samsung Galaxy S7:Another great Samsung phone:I've only had the phone for 2 weeks, but so far I love it. I had a Samsung Galaxy S4 mini for almost 3 years, so it was definitely time for an upgrade! It was an easy transition from one phone to another, and I really like the functionality of the OS. The camera is terrific! I use my phone to document all the family memories, so a good camera is a must for me.:2017-01-07:Galaxy S7 user

Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it, work and play:I've been using it since just after it came out. Got 2 for my daughters just recently. I like the GearVR although I don't use it much, like that it plays games well. Big enough screen for that and movies without getting to be ridiculous. Only gripe is that I wish they'd add a speaker to the top though for stereo.:2017-01-06:KenKofDF
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesome phone:I transfered over this phone from another carrier. Loving the compact stylish look. Always reliable and easy to use.:2017-01-06:Glennrosa196054
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition:I had to buy a new phone as my puppy ate my S5; funny now, not so funny then.  I have  been very pleased with my new phone.  Operationally, it is almost identical to my S5 which I liked very much.  The transition went well with the exception of the transfer of my calendar; some of the appointments were lost.  Other than that, I am very satisfied.  The battery life could be a little better, but I can easily get through the day on a full charge.  I was disappointed that the new phone did not come with a car charger.  I was informed that my S5 charger would work in so far as powering the phone, but would not be able to charge it.  I felt that the car charger should have come with the new phone.:2017-01-06:Jackman71

Samsung Galaxy S7:I like this phone a lot!:This is my second smartphone and I was dreading getting a new one because of the difficulty I had getting used to the first one. This one took a while (1-2 weeks) for me to customize it, but it was pretty easy to figure out how to use it and get used to it .  The battery is great, it's extremely easy to get to the common settings, such as turning data/wifi/bluetooth on and off, there are lots of options for customization, and mostly things are easy to do.  The only thing I miss is a normal telephone ringtone that is fairly loud, but so far what I've chosen is working out.:2017-01-05:happygrandma1

Samsung Galaxy S7:Glad I made the move!:"I was using a Galaxy Note 3 that was functioning, but only at about 70% (battery not holding charge; screen cracked; apps not responsive sometimes). But now that I have crossed over, I couldn't be happier.  The new S7 has a smaller screen, but with the improved resolution, you wouldn't know. It is bright, quick and had a minimal learning curve for me coming from the Note 3. We have extremely poor signal at home, but the Verizon folks were able to assist with activation by ""pushing"" to me so I didn't need to leave home.":2017-01-03:jnzdogs

Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone is reliable, robust, and easy to use if you come from an Android phone already.:"The phone its self is pretty solid, well built, and so far reliable. I dropped my phone (inside an otter box defender case) from a 12' roof into water about 4"" deep. I didn't realize it had fallen out of my nail bags but when I found the phone, it still functioned fine. I attribute the 'crash protection' of the case to the drop protection but the phone its self did not allow water to enter, as advertised.  The new version of Android is easier to use in some ways, but some features are a little harder to find. Such as stopping the download manager, and the developer features. But this is partly learning curve for the newest android version. Texting over a wifi network is also a great benefit for me. Overall the phone and the Android OS are working well with no issues. I remain solidly convinced that Samsung makes one of the best phones on the market at the moment.  1. Battery life under heavy use with wifi and Bluetooth on is about 14 hours. I have stretched that to 4 days without charging if I turn on the power saving features in the settings drop down. 2. Call quality is outstanding and easy to hear and understand even on speaker.  3. Charging time is rather short, about an 45 minutes- hour from 1% to 100% even when all features (wifi, bluetooth) are still on.  4. Camera functions well, taking great photos in all conditions so far. The magnify feature is also VERY useful for me and shows an extremely clear close up view of anything that is more than 5 inches from the camera. 5. The Google play app for music is a little hard to navigate, but I don't listen to much music on my phone. However the music from the phone is very clean/clear and loud enough to be heard clearly over normal talking and chatter.":2016-12-29:I dont have a nick name

Samsung Galaxy S7:a nice step up:"Having had an S4 and S6, both of which worked well, I expected good things from the S7.  Battery life is much improved, and the new camera does some very nice tricks (as well as taking very good photos).

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone. Off to a good start.:Switched from Straight talk and a locked Samsung s3 to Verizon Galaxy s7.

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great battery life, quick charging, light weight:I just got this cell last week, & I absolutely love it. I'm not one to change cell phones often, but when I saw this deal, I just couldn't pass it up. I had a note3 which was also a reliable phone, the only drawback for me is the note was bulky & heavy. I think I made the right choice with the galaxy7:2016-12-28:Karma_Geddon
Samsung Galaxy S7:Excellent Upgrade:"I upgraded to the S7 two weeks ago, replacing a Samsung Core Prime. It is slightly larger; has a much sharper display; has much better battery life; is much faster; and has a lot more useful ""Bells & Whistles"". Great phone!":2016-12-28:abcabc

Samsung Galaxy S7:LOVE IT.......LOVE IT:I'VE ONLY HAD IT FOR 11 DAYS AND IT JUST GETS BETTER AS I LEARN ALL THE FEATURES IT HAS...........:2016-12-28:RONBOW
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good features; fairly smooth transfer of data/apps from old phone:"1. Not all my contacts seemed to have transferred to the new phone; were there some contacts on my old memory card that were different from the ones on the old phone? If so, is there a way to get all of the contacts from both locations onto the new phone? 2. Not all my old apps transferred to the new phone. I had to make a list and locate them on the Playstore and download again. 3. Having all the Verizon apps and all the Samsung apps in one icon is not necessarily an advantage when I'm trying to find something. 4. The first app page is in alphabetical order, but then the next app page starts off again with A-Z; I liked it better when all 4 pages were in alphabetical order. 5. It just may be that I have to learn all over again how to maneuver with this phone, which is unfortunate, because I read the 300 page library book on my Samsung S5 from cover to cover (""S5 for Dummies""), but many things seem to work differently on the S7.":2016-12-28:PW12
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use and much better than my previous Samsung Mini:I like the larger screen size...the better camera...the longer battery life...the fast charging (30 minutes)...all improvements over what frustrated me with my other phone.:2016-12-28:slaterba

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, durable, sleek, and cool!:"It had been a long time since I have purchased a ""new"" phone for myself... all my previous phones were hand me downs... and i was long overdue for an upgrade.  I do not regret this purchase!  The phone is sleek and such an easy transition!  I choose to use the USB to file transfer all my data and it could not have been simpler.  Having gone from a Note 4 to the S7, there was no guessing on how to operate or using features.  And the camera is AMAZING!  Near professional quality.  I definitely recommend this phone to anyone who is a Samsung Galaxy fan!":2016-12-27:becca_dem3208

Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesome Phone!:My husband and I recently upgraded our old LG G3 phones to this one and wow what a difference! This phone is the perfect size (I never really cared for how huge my LG G3 was), it's waterproof, the battery life is amazing (It lasts a lot longer than my LG G3), and the options and what you can do with it is awesome. It also does not overheat at all and the fast charging cable works great. I get a full charge in half of the time than what a regular charger gives me. I also love the earbuds that come with this phone. Very clear and awesome sounding.:2016-12-27:KLP26

Samsung Galaxy S7:Transfer of information from old phone far easier than led to believe:I looked for a couple of hours for the best way to transfer my data/texts/ contacts, etc, from my old Core Prime and couldn't find much help. Finally, I started opening up my new phone, and lo and behold, it was easy as pie. Shut off the old phone, turn on the Samsung Galaxy S7, let it initialize, then connect the two phones with the supplied adapter and all my data, apps, text messages, etc, came over with the push of a button. Verizon needs to work on that one to let you know it's far easier than it looks.:2016-12-26:jhill123

Samsung Galaxy S7:So much faster than my Galaxy S5!:I wasn't going to buy a new phone. My Galaxy S5 worked just fine. However, now that I have had the S7 for a couple of weeks, I wouldn't trade it away. It has a sleek design and very fast performance.:2016-12-24:EllenDF

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone:The 7 is so much nicer then the 5:2016-12-23:Keith E
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love my Galaxy 7! Better features, very fast, ease of access better than ever!:Galaxy 7 is better than ever! I especially love the new themes you can get for your whole phone to change how all the apps as well as background looks. Instead of individualizing each area, it is all in one theme. Downside is that there are very few that are free but the cost to buy one is cheap so I like my phone very personalized, so its worth it to me! I was used to being able to slide through about 4 or 5 app pages on the home screen, but Samsung has combined them into a 2 page apps view and there are combined app buttons to put all of Googles apps into one file etc so you dont have to scroll so much to find what you need. Love that. Better placement of the microphone for more clear calls...at bottom of phone instead of the back of it in previous models. Great Phone, good buy!:2016-12-23:danie66

Samsung Galaxy S7:Still getting used to it but love it so far:I just upgraded from the S4 to the S7 and, although I'm still getting used to it, I love it so far. The tutorials and tips are great if I need to reference them.  I like the size is comfortable and the screen is clear and easy to read. I really like the photos that I have taken so far, and the apps are easy to navigate.  The only drawback to the phone is that the earphone jack is now on the bottom rather than the top, which is awkward when I set my phone on the treadmill. Other than that, I am enjoying it.:2016-12-22:bastet_1968

Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition:I bought the phone on Black Friday.  I didn't set it up for a few weeks.

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone!:Coming from Motorola phones this was a huge performance increase. My old Droid was touted as the best battery lasting device. I was lucky to go 10 hours even when new. This S7 puts that Motorola to shame along either a better camera that doesn't hesitate when snapping a shot. I mostly use my phone as a phone but the additional features I do use are much faster and smoother. Very satisfied.:2016-12-09:FFR1812

Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to transfer from S5 to S7:I bought this phone a couple of weeks ago to upgrade from my S5 and I am very happy with performance so far.  It was very easy to transfer over all of my data and apps with Verizon Cloud and Content Transfer. I have all of my messages, pictures, and documents.  I really like the fingerprint function to unlock my phone which makes it secure and quick to access. I also enjoy that it is slightly smaller in width than the S5 which is easier for me to hold and fit into pockets.:2016-12-08:NightPsych
Samsung Galaxy S7:Same Samsung quality:Works like my S5 did. It's nice having the expandable memory (card).:2016-12-08:tntrauk

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone. Easy transition from previous phone.:Samsung SmartSwitch App makes transition very easy. Better camera than S5.:2016-12-08:syuirvca2016
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the Galaxy S7!:I upgraded to the Galaxy S7 from the Galaxy S5. So far it is working better than my previous phone regarding speed and a few more features.I love the increased access to my most used apps on my home page. Previously the app icon access was limited requiring scroll to other pages to find apps. I haven't had time to explore much of it's capability or the picture quality yet but hope too soon. I love the notifications, time, date and battery display with the Always on Display feature without unlocking the phone. The Smart Switch app (and the Verizon rep) made it easy to transfer the old data/apps from my previous phone to the S7. Also love that unsaved callers are identified now with calls. Will make it easier to avoid/block telemarketer calls and to add new friends to my contacts. The option for 2 apps on the Lock screen is also great. I love that the Verizon apps and the Samsung apps are organized into separate files and not with the rest of the apps - makes it easier to find. The only negative thing is the sensitivity of the screen/key board is not quite as good as my last phone. I often have to repeatedly press the screen to finish a text. I have been very pleased with my Samsung phones and will likely continue with this product line.:2016-12-08:Beth in VA
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great overall phone.:Have had phone for two weeks and am very happy with it so far. Still discovering new and better features.:2016-12-08:MaryK2u
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very nice phone!:2nd week using phone. Overall, it is fast! Google maps mysteriously work better with this phone than previous versions. Why? I  don't know... But, I deliver pizza, I've noticed a big difference in accuracy. Sound is great. Only problem with this phone is that manufacturer did not provide a good user guild to go with it. So, I spend a lot of time figuring out how things work. Also.... Very few choices for wallpaper.:2016-12-08:toby2399

Samsung Galaxy S7:Absolutely love this phone.  Favorite one yet:Got this phone a week ago, I've had the first galaxy, s3, s5, and now this the s7.  I've also used the LG g2 and g3. Up until this point my favorite phone has been the g3 but now the s7  has surpassed that. Runs great, amazing camera, beautifully designed, convenient features just the full package. The only thing it's missing is the ability to be a remote control. In the s7 they took out the infrared. I miss that:2016-12-06:Taylor33
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesomeness!:Glad I upgraded my phone and special happy to be back with Verizon! Had horrible coverage and always lost my signal with att... can't be having that as aneeded our driver, now can I?:2016-12-06:Kryst_777

Samsung Galaxy S7:VERY GLAD We made the upgrade!:"The S7 has BY FAR the absolute BEST voice quality I've ever had on a cell phone.  Incoming calls no longer sound like the caller is talking into a tin can!    My wife and I love the display, and all the new ways you can customize it.  Having 32 Gig opens up space for apps for which I did not have room on my previous phone.  I missed the ability to set the ""back"" and ""app history"" buttons to stay lit whenever the phone is in use.  Fortunately, someone wrote an APP for that...and I'm running that.  (those are the hot-spot areas to the immediate LEFT and RIGHT of the actual button at the bottom of the phone).    We also got the fast-charge wireless charging pad, and find it very useful...no longer have to fight with the charging cord to get it ""just right"" to fit into the charge port.":2016-12-05:Church Organist
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung:No comments at all good,phone nobody die:2016-12-05:Joseam

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone, Easy Transition:Have had this new S7 two weeks and I'm loving it.  The transition from my S6 was really seamless. I was concerned the camera would not be as good as my previous S6 since it has less megapixels, but no worries!  The camera on the S7 is even better!  And I certainly like the ability to add a microdisc for additional data  storage, especially for photos.:2016-12-05:3rdSamsung

Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it!! Very easy and fast transaction.:I got this phone a week ago and couldn't be happier with my decision to get the Samsung Galaxy S7. I had got the Note 7, and I'm sad to say that didn't work out. When I returned it, I got a iPhone 6S Plus, because I'd never had an iPhone I thought I'd try it. Well I didn't care for the iPhone it was way different than the android phones.I've ALWAYS had android phones so it probably was a big factor in my decision to take it back. I got the Samsung Galaxy S7 and I'm Loving it!!  Thank you Very Much, Elaine Thompson:2016-12-05:Elaine T

Samsung Galaxy S7:So far, so good.:I've only had it less than a month but so far I like it a lot. I really like that they got rid of that little flap thing that covered the charging port. I hated that thing. I like the phone isn't any bigger than the S5 (if it is, it's very slight/if it's smaller, that's also slight). I only wish they came in more colors than black or gold. I got the Gold and it's beautiful.:2016-12-05:unicorn59
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung S7:I've only had the phone about a week, but so far it has been excellent. Some differences on the S7 vs my old android that are very handy are having the number line at the top of the keyboard and the relocation of the speech button:2016-12-05:Helmsie

Samsung Galaxy S7:Really impressed:I've had this phone for 2 weeks now and I love this phone. Great processor speed, battery life, SD card slot, all the features that I love in an android phone. It has a good feel in your hand, fits well in your pocket but it's not so thin that I'm afraid of breaking it if I sit down.   It's a Samsung so there's a wide variety of accessories available from both Samsung or third party vendors,  if you're into that.   Only one complaint, Samsung has a lot of proprietary software that can't be uninstalled. None of it so far has affected the phones performance, but it does add a lot of clutter and I had to spend some time customizing it. All around happy with this phone.:2016-12-03:Pingomalingo

Samsung Galaxy S7:Exactly like my S5, but better!:Before my transition to the S7, I had the S5 and never had any major issues with the performance of my phone, except what was to come with the having it for 2 1/2 years. I LOVED my S5, and was so set on getting the S7 and finally did and do not regret it one bit! The S7 does everything the S5 did, except it's much faster, takes amazing pictures, oh and I looovveeee goooollldddd! And the HD phone calls are so clear and don't have a hard time hearing people over the phone anymore. So if you are a huge fan of the Galaxy S5 you will LOVE  the S7!:2016-12-03:Chelcie42

Samsung Galaxy S7:excellent performance and features vs. Galaxy S5:I bought this a few days ago, and have been very happy with it. The FM radio is handy, which I had missed with the Galaxy S5. Getting apps set up was easy, and responsiveness is very good. Battery life is also much better than the S5, and it doesn't have the clunky flap to open the USB charging slot. The only problem I have encountered is that often the fingerprint scanner doesn't pick up my fingerprint swipe, and I end up having to enter the password.:2016-11-30:baseball bob

Samsung Galaxy S7:Fast. Vibrant screen.:Upgraded from a Galaxy s5.  Considered switching to the Pixel but didn't like that the Pixel wasn't waterproof.

Samsung Galaxy S7:Quick, great camera, easy to use!:Upon my upgrade being due - I went from a Galaxy 5 to a Google Pixel....I learned quickly it was a mistake.

Samsung Galaxy S7:Absolutely perfect:I not only switched carriers recently, I also switched phones. My old phone, the LG G4, was horrible and draining the battery. Part of that being is that Facebook came pre-loaded on my phone with no way of taking it off. My new phone doesn't come with FB on it, and thus my battery is lasting that much longer. The phone is light. It's beautiful. And it's exactly what I wanted.:2016-11-23:jwrosas

Samsung Galaxy S7:Everything I expected and more.:Great, highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy S7:2016-11-21:Happymadman
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone:I had a Lumia Icon, which I dropped and smashed the screen. I loved the Windows 10 user interface, but not the lack of apps. I don't like iPhones, but do like the iPhone 5SE for its size. I picked the Galaxy S7 because it had all the features I like. I especially like all the apps I can download. What I don't like is all the Samsung and Verizon apps and the keyboard is not as nice as the Windows phone. I really like the phone though. It is very responsive.:2016-11-21:BobsterMN
Samsung Galaxy S7:great features, design and usability:It was refreshing to return to Android after using iOS. I couldn't be happier with the GS7's overall performance, battery longevity, camera and wireless charging capability. Nice work from Samsung.:2016-11-21:Tallgirl64

Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesome phone!  AAA+++:I went from an S6 edge to this new S7.  The transition was seamless and this phone is absolutely glitch free.  It loads fast,  and the amoled display is the best in the business,  period.  Good battery life,  water resistant,  lots of storage.  Definitely a best buy for me.:2016-11-20:LyleG
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great display, fast charging, quick fingerprint unlock:I love this phone. The display is clear and bright. The fingerprint sensor unlocks the phone nearly instantly. Battery life is good and it charges quickly when it needs charging. It's also nice to have good protection against water. Only 32 GB storage, but I added a 64GB card so I have plenty of space for photos and everything else.:2016-11-20:roy123
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use:I have had a Samsung Galaxy since they first started making them. I Iike the ease of use and how they remain consistent. The S7 is the same. That's why I stick with Samsung:2016-11-20:crcjg
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone!:I upgraded from an S5 to the S7.  Much of it is the same, which I really like because it lessens the learning curve.  I have to say that the camera does a fantastic job.  I used it to take some scenic pics and used the HDR feature.  Several of the photos looked like they could have been paintings!  (I've attached one of them so you can see what I'm talking about.):2016-11-19:Birdieraye

What a dream of a phone to talk on.  I can hear everything people are saying now with HD voice built in.  This phone is so easy to use.  I also bought the Samsung Wireless Charging Stand and I love it as well.  Thank you Samsung for the most outstanding phone I've ever owned.  I will recommend it to all my friends and family!:2016-11-17:Miss Lead

Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the camera.  Great resolution on the screen.:I've had the s7 for about 2 weeks and I love it.  I upgraded from an s4 and although there is a slight learning curve to some features and apps, for the most part it is very similar A lot faster though and the picture quality is great.  Brighter, clearer screen too.  Even though there's not a lot of difference in size, the screen seems so much bigger.  Perhaps it's just the clear picture.   The ring tones and alerts are much louder too as well as the speaker which has been moved to the bottom of the phone instead of the top.:2016-11-17:Nanatommc
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great camera!:Camera takes excellent pictures. Enjoying the features.:2016-11-17:DBL7

Samsung Galaxy S7:Love this phone:Just upgraded to this phone from a Maxx and I'm so happy I switched to Samsung. I loved my Droid, but all the options for customization for this phone are fantastic! My only regret is that I really wish I could have gotten this phone in blue. And the battery isn't lasting as long as I hoped, but that's probably because I can't get off of this thing!:2016-11-13:Wolfie787

Samsung Galaxy S7:Barely sips power:Upgraded from S5 to S7 I loved my S5 for the 2+ years I used it but it was time to upgrade. Couldn't be more happy with the S7. I don't know what they did to make it possible but it's a power saving monster. It sips power rather than gulping like the S5 did.  It's fast. I like the new features. Overall, it's a great, great phone.:2016-11-11:daddinessmonster

The transfer from my old phone to the Samsung Galaxy S7 was seamless, and I feel like I didn't miss a thing! I love the camera on the S7 - it's much better than any previous versions of the Galaxy that I've had. I really like that they kept a great style and resolution on the phone.

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great so far - an easy transition from my S5:Upgraded to the S7 because my S5 stopped charging. Overall, the S7 has been great. It operates quicker and has a nice sleek design - recommend getting a cover with some grip, it's slippery without one. Camera takes sharper pics and the clarity of phone calls seems to be drastically improved. My only complaint is that the keyboard is really sensitive so it took some getting used to - using 1 hand to swype/text is not as easy to accomplish. Got better once I got a grippy cover.:2016-11-08:Joanne M
Samsung Galaxy S7:Perfect:Great screen size, and the internals are what stun.  We have 4 gigs of RAM (which allows greater multitasking) 820 processing power and an on board gaming card.  Love it.:2016-11-08:Gr33nCr33p3r

Samsung Galaxy S7:Love this phone!:I just bought this phone about two weeks ago. I LOVE IT! I have  upgraded  from a Galaxy 4; this phone does so much more. Much better battery,  better camera which takes great pictures in  low light as advertised. Faster processor. Love the HD and Wi-Fi calling features; in my workplace, I have a very low mobile signal, and so this feature helps me now to receive all of my  calls and talk to  people clearly. I wish that I had upgraded sooner.:2016-11-03:Braskamyrna
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great S7:This is a great phone. It can doo all you want, and more! There is no better:2016-11-03:RJRDC
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the Phone:I love my phone with the exception of the alarm! My S4 would let me swipe left to snooze and swipe right to cancel.  The alarm on the S7 has a tiny button to push to snooze and the big red slide to cancel.  It's taking alot to get use to that feature.  Other than that, the phone is great! It charges really fast and I love how quick everything is!:2016-11-02:kcjo25

Samsung Galaxy S7:S7 vs Pixel:I bought this 2 weeks ago after returning my Pixel. The images in Pixel are poor compared to the S7. Pictures taken in low light were grainy. Zoom is very limited, could only zoom to half of screen size vs S7 which is full screen and more. Just got back from WY and the S7 pics are all amazing! It has so many options to adjust for any light level. Easy to use. The phone is fantastic. I have an S5 before this. My only regret is that the camera had 16mp like my S5, not 12mp.  I am so glad to have returned the Pixel. Samsung has done it again!:2016-11-02:Dmb5
Samsung Galaxy S7:Was an easy transition from my s5.:Bought this 2 weeks ago, was an easy transfer from my s5. But is you are switching from apple it will take you a while to get use to it.:2016-11-02:Almeida2
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features. Very fun:I was a little hesitant about going from a Note 4 to a smaller Galaxy S7. I'm glad I did it because I love it! Easy to text with one hand, it's cuter. The only thing I miss is the S pen, but the pros definitely outweigh the cons.:2016-11-01:Janelle23
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use I love my S7:Just got it and I enjoy it so much:2016-11-01:Sammypeach
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone:I bought this phone less than two weeks ago. It works fine. I do lose my play lists in the Amazon media player when I restart the phone.   I did have trouble with ordering. I went online to order for in store pickup. The order got stuck in the system. Five hours later, I had to visit the store to get the order released. Very frustrating.  I took the phone home to activate it. I live in a dead zone. I was told, by an employee, that only a good Wi-Fi signal was needed to activate. That is wrong. I had to return to the store to get it activated. Very frustrating.   The in store manager was helpful, professional and great help. She made sure I walked away completely satisfied.   The lesson I learned was ALWAYS activate at the store.:2016-11-01:None of the above
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone!:Love the phone, tons of features.... still discovering them:2016-11-01:Nessy808

I did make sure it was not the equipment that blew up...it is NOT.  I love everything about it.  It is so elegant and has new features I love.  It's also easy for a 65-year-old to learn after you learn the phone won't explode if you press a wrong button.  Phone is fast-loading on the internet, too.  I love, love, love it!  It can also be used internationally, which is fabulous.  Transfer of data from my old phone was a breeze.  I bought my phone at Verizon, and the salesman was just tremendously helpful.:2016-10-30:Arni from Montana
Samsung Galaxy S7:easy to use:great phone easy to use:2016-10-30:sssmith2003
Samsung Galaxy S7:Fantastic as expected:We've had the phone for over a week and it's outstanding. We added an ArmorSuit screen protector and Caseology leather case for style and protection. It's as near perfect as can be. It does draw fingerprints, but not an issue now with the protection. It should also have a front flash for better selfies but oh well, still worth 5 stars.:2016-10-30:CurtisFLL

Samsung Galaxy S7:My all around device for everything!:I resisted upgrading my old feature phone for almost 10 years since I mostly just use it to make & receive calls & texts, but as a result also carry a tablet  and a small point & shoot camera. This phone has replaced all with vastly superior capability! Very happy and satisfied with my choice.

Samsung Galaxy S7:Perfect size for me:Love the s7. Previously had the s6 Edge plus. Honestly I didn't like the edge feature at all. It looked nice but that's about it. Not worth the extra money for me. The s7 has an absolutely  incredible display and I couldn't be happier with it. As far as size I find it perfect .... not too big and not too small.

Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy Transfer:My S5 screen broke and I needed to upgrade and I had already decided to upgrade to the S7. I love the phone. It's lightweight almost too much but a nice sturdy case makes it feel safer - especially when you drop it - which I have already.  I was dreading the transfer of content from my old phone to this phone. I was able to get the S5 powered up, used SmartSwitch and within about an hour ALL of my content was on my new phone.:2016-10-24:CADiver

Samsung Galaxy S7:Only one flaw - battery life:I've had this phone for a week. I love the size (smaller than the turbo I had ), but it only lasts one day on a battery charge with moderate use. This S7 has great features, is easy to use,  the camera has lots of options for taking pics, and everything has the feel of quality. Be careful if you are opposed to phone cases like I am because this phone is slippery!:2016-10-23:Chris973

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone! Easy to change from windows phone.:I am so happy with this phone. I was reluctant to give up my Nokia windows phone, but with such limitations of selections of apps and more not being updated or being cancelled all of the time, I decided it was time for a change. One of my biggest concerns was if I would be able to link my outlook calendar to my phone as my windows phone had done. I downloaded the outlook app and tied in perfectly. This phone is easy to use, light weight, big but not too big, and has a huge selection of apps. Very easy to transition to and amazing to use. Very much loving  this  Samsung Galaxy S7!:2016-10-22:Roseval

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great improvement over the former Galaxy S5:I have been using the S7 for about a week now, and I'm quite happy with it. The camera is WAY improved.  Better focus and quicker pictures, even in lower light conditions.  Make sure you get an SD card for the storage, as the increased resolution could eat up your memory quick. Speaking of SD storage, access to the SD is improved, with storage outside of the battery compartment, sharing space with the SIM card. Audio is improved - louder and seems better directed towards the user. The interface itself is nicer.  Samsung didn't go messing with the menus and locations too much, so previous Galaxy users won't get frustrated from thumb memory. And to be expected, performance from the better chipset is great. Oh yeah, voice calling does seem better, even in my home's reception blackhole. They also scooted the power button down a bit, making it easier to reach with the thumb.:2016-10-02:houston tx

Samsung Galaxy S7:Yet another great Galaxy!:So far, only having this Galaxy S7 a week, I'm very happy with it! Yes, I've had to install the video player app since they've inexplicably not included it, but that's not a big deal. I love the inclusion of a graphic equalizer, the improved camera, and the new ability to plug-in a flash drive with the included adapter. I wish they had kept the removable battery layout. The so-called rapid charger is not rapid at all, taking roughly the same amount of time to charge as my old Galaxy S5, and as with the S5, it gets uncomfortably hot during charging, updating, or shooting long videos. I'm glad that they kept the micro SD card option, as it's a deal-maker for me. I would definitely recommend this phone! I used to have an iPhone, but after switching to the Galaxy S5, and now the S7, I will never have another iPhone. This simply devours the iPhone!:2016-09-25:Mopar Lover
Samsung Galaxy S7:Larger screen:I like the larger screen than on my little mini smart phone. This one also has a better camera, which I seem to use quite often. Don't even take my old good camera with me anymore.:2016-09-25:jashas

Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use!:I bought it a week ago and have found that it's been easier to set up than previous ones I've had in the past. The only thing is it disconnects from the wireless too often. More than my S5 did.:2016-09-22:Jenryan

Samsung Galaxy S7:Soooo much better than my LG G2:I love this phone! The only thing I would add is a direct dial button on the home screen for calling people without having to search through contacts.:2016-09-21:Montemccully
Samsung Galaxy S7:Huge Improvement!:I had an S5, which I loved, but the processor couldn't keep up anymore. Transferring everything was super easy. I didn't even need instructions, just connected the phones & began. Love the size, love where the power button is. I don't dislike having the audio jack on the bottom since I use my aux cord a lot more than my headphones. My only complaint is where the mic is. I tended to cover it with my finger and thought I had a defective phone before I realized what the issue was.:2016-09-21:UntouchableShe
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung user:Had a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge that my battery overheated on and damaged the phone. Replaced with the S7. First time I've ever needed to replace or had an issue with Samsung phone.:2016-09-21:Shelandchad97

Samsung Galaxy S7:The Galaxy family continues its win streak:"I had the S1, S3, S5, and now the S7. Each time Samsung has improved the speed, capabilities, and design of the phone. Of course, nothing's perfect, but with each generation I have never had problems with the phone freezing, being frustratingly slow, or not working properly. If you take care of this phone, it will take care of you.  Pros: Fast, lots of space, looks great, menu/settings are familiar (so you don't have to learn a whole new settings scheme. This makes it so easy to pick up and go from the previous generations). Although I've used Atom Launcher on my S3, 5, and now 7, the new ""Themes"" option makes it so easy to customize the look of your phone, I wouldn't be surprised if Atom Launcher can't keep up.  Cons: ""Always on"" feature...it's a good idea, I use it, but I haven't notice it save the battery at all. In fact, the battery seems to drain faster on the S7 than the S5. Body design...although the phone looks so awesome, you really need to purchase a phone case. The phone body on its own is very slippery. As soon as the oils from your hand get on it, it gets worrisome to hold.":2016-09-20:GalaxyFTW
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Features and additional Phone options:I am please I continue with Verizon Phone Options and Plan.:2016-09-20:Newport2
Samsung Galaxy S7:Best Galaxy yet; super easy transition & migration!:I've had Galaxy 3, 4, 5, 6 Edge, and now 7 (non Edge).  Best version yet.  Terrific battery life, Super screen, Camera is superb, and the fingerprint sensor is very fast.:2016-09-19:AKLitman

Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone -- familiar, yet new:I really like Samsung phones. And while I had to deal with the problem-filled Galaxy Note 7 (not Verizon's fault), I'm happy to go forward with my S7.:2016-09-19:MD431

Samsung Galaxy S7:Best touchscreen:Most responsive phone I've had:2016-09-18:trednoah
Samsung Galaxy S7:Much better phone:This phone renewed my confidence with Verizon.  My previous phone was a Galaxy Core Prime, and I almost switched carriers because of that phone.  The S7 phone is a much better phone.  It has a better battery and a LOT more storage capacity.  My previous phone made me sound like a robot,  would miss calls and delay texts, and sounded like an old cordless home phone switching channels when I would talk to someone.  I learned my lesson about buying a budget phone.  Galaxy S series phones seem to be the most reliable phones Samsung makes.:2016-09-18:zukiwill
Samsung Galaxy S7:it does what i needed:I Like it and have had no problems yet:2016-09-18:rj15

Samsung Galaxy S7:Love this phone!:I've only had this phone for about 10 days, but I already love it. I read about some of the new features before buying it, so it made the transition easier. The Verizon employees who helped me were knowledgeable and got me on my way  pretty fast. They've even called to see if everything is going well with the phone and to see if I have any questions. The customer service was great.:2016-09-16:Bev2
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy s7:I have had my new phone for about a week now.  I was using the Samsung Galaxy S4 and in my opinion was one of the worst phones I have had.

Samsung Galaxy S7:What an improvement over the 5!!!:After struggling with a S5 phone that never seemed to work right, this phone is heaven!  Right now I have only had it for about two weeks but I can say that there is not anything I have tried to do that I don't like or can't figure out.  One blip.....I use the airplane mode often and find that it was easier to access when pulling down the screen on the old Samsung.  The s7 you have to scroll once to the left.  No biggie but you asked for feedback!:2016-09-14:jk1941
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone:I'm not a big tech person so this is a simple and easy to use. It has a good camera and great battery life. I know it has a lot more capacity than what I use but I like that if I need it its there.:2016-09-14:bkd1

Samsung Galaxy S7:Store Staff  made it  EASY. I love the way it works.:The store staff took my old Iphone and got me  good price for it, took everything off my old phone and set up my new one for me. I love the way it works. It's a bigger screen than I had, and nice Google connectivity. Voice Mail was not set up for a few days till I figured that out, but I will be happy for a few years now.:2016-09-13:Shawnism
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great service!:Josue made it so easy for my whole family to upgrade. We needed lots of answers, and his expertise made it simple. We are fairly tech savvy but Josue's focus on meeting our needs efficiently was exactly what we were looking for from Verizon.:2016-09-13:Mo W

Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesome phone with little complaint:"I had a Galaxy S4 for 2 years and loved it, and was worried about upgrading, because my husband has an S5 and it's terrible.  I had no need to worry though!  The S7 is amazing!  Very fast and easy to use.  They have made improvements over the prior phones.  Only a couple of down sides: 1. Back is glass, which I did not know and got a crack in it the very first day. Lesson - don't use a cheap case. 2. They need to figure out how to make better glass add in screens that fit the whole screen without having the edges come un-stuck.  3. You can not currently adjust screen sensitivity and this is really not cool. How do you forget to add that as a feature? I'm nit picking, but trying to be honest. Overall, I'm very pleased with my new phone and would recommend it!!!":2016-08-24:AmbrosiaJ

Samsung Galaxy S7:Amazing Phone:Bought this phone about three months ago and I can say that I LOVE it!  The Snapdragon 820 processor is amazingly quick.  Camera is by far the best out of the box. If you decide to learn more about the camera options, you can fine tune the phone to match a professional camera.  A 3,000 mAh battery is incredible.  I'm a moderate to heavy user of the phone and I can say that it does me well for a daily driver.  Generally I'm left with about 35% at the end of the day at 10 PM. The water proofing is also amazing!  I've submerged it in a glass of water for about 25ish minutes and it works just fine.  There have been occasions where I've even taken it to a pool to shoot some video and pictures and nothing bad happened.  Just make sure you don't leave it in the pool for more than 30 minutes just for safe keeping.  The body is extremely easy to hold and all buttons are easily accessible. Some extra perks are the fingerprint scanner, super high resolution screen and the wireless charging capabilities! So far I LOVE this phone and this is after six years of iPhone usage.  Best phone on the market and I'll recommend this phone to ANYONE!  Good job, Samsung ;):2016-08-17:DTrick

Samsung Galaxy S7:Definitely an upgrade from my S4:I still had my S4 and it would drop mobile service. This one has much better connectivity inside my house (which is a BIG deal). Everyone has trouble with connectivity inside this condo. The pictures are amazing and the special effects like pan, slow mo and more are just fun!. Storage will not be an issue here either. The sound quality has been within normal limits. On a trip where I was using it for navigating from winery to winery and taking tons of pictures, It did get low battery by 6-7p after unplugging around 8a.

Samsung Galaxy S7:Small upgrade from previous Samsung Galaxy:Great phone, pretty much the same as previous models with small tweaks. Not a huge fan of going back to micro USB 2.0 instead of 3.0, and the micro SD card requires a tool to remove. These 2 things make backing up photos a bit of a hassle.

Samsung Galaxy S7:So much better than the iPhone:Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed my time as abVerizon iPhone user. But, as someone who truly believes these gadgets are meant to simplify life, I found that the iPhone was making mine more complicated. You see, I am a PC user and trying to seamlessly sync my iPhone with my MS Outlook Calendar and Contacts was a constant nightmare. During syncs, contact info would get scrambled. And I hated the fact that iTunes counted how many times I played a song, etc. I also couldn't stand how they controlled my data storage on the device. The Samsung Galaxy S7 really allows me to control my experience- Even the camera is awesome! For very little money, I picked up a SIM card and am now able to really take all of my music and pictures with me without taxing the phone's internal storage. This is the smart phone experience I have been waiting for!:2016-08-01:HappySamsung7User

Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to transition to:I bought this to replace a Samsung Galaxy S4. Before I made my decision I did a lot of comparisons. I knew what I didn't want.  So far I love the ease of using the New Samsung Galaxy S7.:2016-07-28:Tea16

Samsung Galaxy S7:Best phone I've had ever:Had this phone for two wks and if you get this get the gear vr too amazing excellent battery and call clarity:2016-07-28:Lake32
Samsung Galaxy S7:great phone. just a little slippery without a case!:I've had this phone for a week now, and am enjoying it. although without a case it is a little hard to hold onto without tapping the sides of the screen, and it is slimmer and rounder than my s5. no worries since i'll be buying a case for it. love the double tap on the home button to quick open the camera, love the removable hidden storage. Samsung included everything you needed to transfer everything from your old phone to this one, and included the tool to open the hidden sd slot. the camera has a pro mode and allows you to shoot in RAW which is wonderful for when I forget my camera at home.:2016-07-28:evoashh
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice transition from my iPhone 4:Previously owned an iphone4, was nervous getting such an upgrade.  I'm glad I did. The images are crisp, great camera, and the battery seems to be lasting longer.  I own a Samsung tablet so switching to the android wasn't too hard, understanding the phone settings were different..very different than the iphone4. Nice though, and much faster.:2016-07-28:Tam92868
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7 review:Easy transition from my S6.:2016-07-28:Tom1003
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love this phone!!!:I've had this phone only a week and absolutely love it! Great features like auto connection via Bluetooth so it knows when you're driving and sends an automatic reply message to those texting you that you're driving and will contact them later. Clarity of screen and sounds is amazing. Lightweight and slim design is great too. Battery life has about 50% leftafter a normal day's use accessing social media, Pandora, news sites, etc.:2016-07-28:SusaninUT

Samsung Galaxy S7:Still getting the settings the way I like them.:The phone is a big improvement from the S5.  The Android settings are a challenge to get all working the way I would like.  I think some of the explanations of the settings could be written in better language so all could understand them.  A terms dictionary might help.  When I was was working my company gave us a course in writing so all audiences could understand what you were writing in plain language.  That is what is needed here.:2016-07-28:Yussel
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:I've had my phone for a Lil while and I love it. I would recommend this phone to anyone. Excellent phone well worth the money.:2016-07-28:SweetShorty 72

Samsung Galaxy S7:Extraordinary:This phone is amazing! I find myself using it just about everyday since picking it up and have yet to run into any problems with it! It is fast and has a great battery life and when it does get low, it charges very quickly after plug in.:2016-07-26:eckelchris
Samsung Galaxy S7:Really Nice Phone:I have the 32GB Black Onyx S7. Previously I had the S6 Edge and both are seamless in terms of performance and design. One of the many features of the S7 thats better than the S6 model if it's expandable memory, which I love since I download a lot of videos, take videos, and take pictures. Another thing is the response time of the touch sensors, despite when using it underwater where in you can mostly just take pictures and such. All the same its an amazing phone and durable too! I'd recommend it to any of my friends, unfortunately they are Apple people so I couldn't convince them otherwise. In all though, and in my opinion it is the best model and company out there among the top smart phone companies.:2016-07-26:Kurona
Samsung Galaxy S7:Best phone ever!:Had the phone for about a month and haven't found a thing which I dislike about it.:2016-07-26:Yodeldog

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Camera, Easy to transition to Android system.:I bought this for the camera and waterproof features. I am so happy to no longer be using a Windows based phone that anything was an improvement. However, I am really impressed by the ease of set up, accessibility of apps and settings.  I am also happy to be able to use Chrome to search and have a huge variety of vetted apps to download.  Wonderful product!:2016-07-25:OWhite
Samsung Galaxy S7:New phone upgrade:I have had a Samsung 3 for years and needed an upgrade.  Knew I wanted to stay with Samsung so I got the Galaxy S7.  It is very different from the one I had.  It will do a lot more than I need it to do.  The only issue I have is that an update loaded and I did not know for almost a whole day that I could not receive incoming calls.  I was getting text but when I went to make a call it would not let me.  I turned the phone off and when it rebooted all was well.:2016-07-25:Kya23
Samsung Galaxy S7:Much faster that S4 but still a bit of a learning curve:The phone works much faster and has some new features that are really cool.  The camera is even better and it was good before.  The colors are terrific.  Since it is similar, it was much easier to transition and most of the apps transferred directly over.  So much easier than previous phones:2016-07-25:John sc
Samsung Galaxy S7:I'm discovering so many great features everyday!!!!:I just got this phone one week ago and I LOVE IT!!!  It has so many terrific features that it will take a while to go through all of them, and I'm looking forward to it!!:2016-07-25:AngieG3

Samsung Galaxy S7:Fast, does what it's supposed to, nice camera:One week in and all is well so far. Purchased the phone online and did the backup/syncing myself with a little bit of research.

Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery life:I acquired my S7 as the result of a 'crash'  of my S6 screen into a mosaic when dropped during one of my ambulance rides 10 days ago. I am so glad to have incredible battery life! !! There's no comparison to the S6.:2016-07-25:Uptown Girl

Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the phone.:Didn't want to get a new phone but had no choice when my Galaxy 3 wouldn't charge anymore.  I stayed with Galaxy as I have had them in the past and I got the 7 and I love it. Only thing the battery doesn't last as long as they say it does.:2016-07-24:tracykiki
Samsung Galaxy S7:Amazing phone, Glad I upgraded!:Just upgraded to this phone and I love how much better it is than the one I had before.  The fast charge capability is really amazing when you have a limited time to charge your phone before heading out of the house.  I also love how clear the camera is, especially how well it works with low light situations.  Also a strangely off feature I love is the HD voice feature when talking to someone with the same option on their phone...it sounds like they are right beside you.  Takes away all the extra noises around you, so driving on the highway you can only hear the person, not the sound of the highway they are on.:2016-07-24:kraigers737
Samsung Galaxy S7:added line and phone for wife:per wife she said she loves everything about her S7.:2016-07-24:railynne

Samsung Galaxy S7:Mostly easy transition from old Galaxy:It was very easy to figure out how to do and find most things on the new Galaxy. Call quality is excellent and the camera is so much better than the old one. I like that the keyboard has the numerals along the top. It worked very well on my recent trip to Brazil.:2016-07-24:DDTosa
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung S7, the best of the cell phones:I have had this phone for about 2 weeks. It is what a cell phone should be like.:2016-07-24:RAYSACTO
Samsung Galaxy S7:Night and Day:Purchased this phone less than a month ago as my Galaxy S3 was not only long in the tooth, but becoming very unresponsive to my commands. My charge port was junk so my transition to the S7 was a no-brainer. Immediately GPS back and way better than before. New modem, Snapdragon processor, Cameras front and rear. Video game, YouTube News outlets in 4K robust color. Speed like you wouldn't believe. The photo quality in low light is unsurpassed even by some SLR cameras. This phone does it all and more. If you are a Samsung lover like me then the S7 needs to  be a definite 1st Choice for your upgrade.:2016-07-24:Daffyduck1970
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone ugrade:It's an amazing phone! Easy to use!:2016-07-24:Jolmarie

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great product:Bought this last week so far it is good:2016-07-24:katthy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Needed an upgrade:I have had a Samsung S3 for over three years, and it has worked wonderfully.  However, the battery started dying too soon, and I took that as a sign to get a new phone.  So now I have the S7.  This a great device.  Very similar in form and function, but I do like the bigger screen.  It is a lot brighter, and I also like how the aps are grouped together.  Overall I really like how easy it is to figure out some of the newer features, as well as the more familiar ones!:2016-07-24:JasonB2809
Samsung Galaxy S7:Pokemon GO made me do it... no shame...:Upgraded only because my S3 mini wasn't compatible with Pokemon GO. Best decision ever. This phone goes all day on normal usages and about 3-4 hrs on Pokemon GO, nonstop (not using energy save mode so im sure you could get another hr of use if it was on). User friendly and easy to navigate.:2016-07-24:Asherdink
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesome phone!:#1 phone you won't go wrong purchasing one. Enjoy!:2016-07-24:JBlue19

Samsung Galaxy S7:Very fast:Got this ohone almst a week ago, switched from an iphone to samsung S7.:2016-07-24:Jharling
Samsung Galaxy S7:Absolutely love it!:Ive been an iPhone user from the start beginning with the iPad touch then upgraded to the phone. I was getting bored with it and neededa change. I was told by friends that I would hate switching from an iPhone to an android but honestly I have no regrets. Both phones are very similar yet very different. But I just like my galaxy s7 much better.:2016-07-23:Pinkglitter83
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesome phone:This is the king of cell phones. Combined with Verizon makes it the best of the BEST.:2016-07-23:DocBruce

Samsung Galaxy S7:A Nice Phone:I only had it for a week. The transition from S5 was not too difficult. The S7 has a great camera, a bright screen, volume is loud, nice features over S5. A longer battery life, faster charging.:2016-07-23:Sunfun1948
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy 7:I bought this 1 week ago and I love it. I had an Iphone before this, but wanted a  larger screen.   Found that this is much quicker.:2016-07-23:JudyOz
Samsung Galaxy S7:not all that is new is better:The Galaxy S7 is a new and phone.  I like the way you an charge it with the expensive charging stand. I have only had it a week and Thanks to Verison cloud I was able to save most everything.   The address book, Contacts are still a mess. Some I can edit some I can not. Don't know why. I just had to delete some and re enter them.  Seem to have a mess between  phone contacts and message contacts.  The new message center is a mess. Glad the old one is still available.  Why can't you personalize the lock screen picture you could on the 5? I think I should stop here.  I preached to my kids that if you can't say something nice don't say anything.:2016-07-23:ttrpt
Samsung Galaxy S7:great phone!:great function. this is an upgrade from my S3 that was a reliable device for 3 years.:2016-07-23:hacesol

Samsung Galaxy S7:In love:Switching was easy Theron was very helpful and friendly.:2016-07-23:Wabbit13
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use, fast smart and intuitive:I lost my LGG3 a couple of weeks ago and was in need for a new phone that is water resistant and has a decent battery life. I chose this phone because of the water resistance. I'mean pretty impressed with how intuitive the keyboard is, battery life and water durability. The voice quality is pretty impressive as well. Overall I say it's the best phone I've ever owned. I used to be a Verizon employee for 12 years so I know my phones. A+ device:2016-07-23:Eferrigno
Samsung Galaxy S7:good phone:"sharp screen, fast loading, right size for me, fun to use, fast charging  cons:  short battery charge life, protective screen doesn't cover the entire screen area, making it hard to use the edges of the screen":2016-07-23:2old2care

Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy 7:Love it. I would recommend this to all my friends and family.:2016-07-22:tmdover
Samsung Galaxy S7:Another great Samsung phone:"So far I'm loving this phone, I've had it a week now and have played with a lot of the settings and features. My previous phone was a Samsung S4 Mini and I really liked it so I knew my next phone was going to be a Samsung as well. I'm a big fan of the S Health app which has a heart rate monitor, has an optional alert that will bug you if you sit too long, and will link up with other apps like Nike + Running. The heart rate monitor is on the back next to the camera, you just press your finger to it and it records your heart rate. You can then tell it what you were doing at that time: resting, after exercise, before exercise, etc. The camera is fantastic, the standby battery life is pretty decent, screen is a great size neither too big nor too small, screen resolution is amazing. And unlike the S6 this one does have a micro SD slot which was very important to me since I had one in my previous phone and wanted to swap it to the new one.

Samsung Galaxy S7:First SmartPhone -- transition not too bad!:"I can see the writing on the wall. Soon my ""regular device"" phone was going to be no more, so I decided I'd take the plunge and go to a smartphone. I didn't want to be like my parents who got 'left behind' the advanve of personal technology sometime in the late 80's. The transition has been pretty smooth. It is just the terminology that sometimes 'stumps' me. Like ""Visual Voice Mail"". I mean, wouldn't that be a text? In any case, after a week of such questions, all of the many decisions and settings have been made and the phone is up and running. I am sure that I'll find more things to 'learn' as I go along, but for now this phone has been flawless. The user interface seems to make logical sense. Good stuff!":2016-07-21:DocJock

Great feel to phone, well built, wonderful display. I love that have Samsung Tablet, Phone and Smart TVs let me use features between devices easily. The S7 is quick to respond, sounds and looks great. They ONLY thing I have found I am not a fan of is there is a VERY SLIGHT curve to the sides of screens and glass screen protectors tend to get lint stuck to the sides because a tiny portion does not quite make contact.. Otherwise I am VERY happy with the phone in all regards.:2016-07-18:jnich68

Samsung Galaxy S7:Such a nice change from my barely functional S2!:I have owned my phone for 8 days and have so appreciated being able to check email or Facebook without the phone freezing, crashing, or rebooting itself! I love the way the screen goes dark when I put the phone in my purse, and was deeply impressed when I went in a tunnel while driving yesterday and the screen instantly compensated its lighting. I am looking forward to learning more about the features in the class I am taking at the Verizon store tomorrow.:2016-07-15:Nancy the librarian

Finally upgrading away from my lovely S4 (which to this day was still running as it had when I first got it years ago.)

I just upgraded the memory from 32GB that came with it to 232GB by adding a 200GB MicroSD card. I came from a Lumia 929 which I liked, but this phone is superior. I love the customizable UI, customizable themes, just everything about how the phone works and Android Marshmallow is an amazing OS.

Samsung Galaxy S7:great phone:Got this phone for my wife however, after using a Note phone she has had a problem adjusting to the smaller size.  I just traded with her so she is using the Note 4 and I am using the S7.  I don't know why everyone is having such a problem with their S7 but mine is working great and I think it is working at the best it can for me.  If there were to be anything at all I would want is to be able to use the S Pen from the Note on it for better writing control.  I have no problem using the old type stylist with my S7.  I will continue to enjoy using it till Samsung develops a phone  or Note that is better and is worth the money I work so hard for. LOL:2016-07-13:Rev Ed

Samsung Galaxy S7:WOW .... Great Phone!:I tend to keep my phones for as long as they work well , my old Galaxy 3 still works but needed a battery so I  upgraded mainly because this one (7s) is supposedly waterproof but if not ..it will be when my case arrives .WOW what a world of difference there is ... Battery Life isn't bad but I dont think its as good as advertised unless you turn everything off to conserve it ... The screen is so much better than my old galaxy and the camera takes great pictures ... tons of memory and expandable to whatever you want ..  Hope it lasts as long as the last one did ... BTW Verizon is the best cell service provider hands down , not the cheapest but the best coverage of them all ...  Thank You:2016-07-11:Fight4FREEDOM

But this time they couldn't revive it. I was having trouble with it freezing up anyway so was not a happy iPhone owner.    I didn't realize what I was getting instead!

My old phone was Samsung Galaxy s5 were trouble and problem the most time . it about screen tech black ou . That why I decided to change to new phone. . I love it:2016-07-08:Mexrose
Samsung Galaxy S7:Fast & Furious!:I purchased online, due for an upgrade my S6 started acting a little funky, so I decided why not? I actually was interested in the S7 Edge, and yet not much difference except battery, so I saved some money and just went with the S7, such a great phone, so quick, smooth working, I love it so far, happy with the purchase.:2016-07-08:Tberry59
Samsung Galaxy S7:Expensive but worth it:Just upgraded from my old Galaxy S3 which is obviously a big step and I'm really happy with the S7. Some of the settings were hard to find at first and aren't very intuitive but there's some good articles online that unpack all of the different settings you can adjust and how to find them. Camera is great even with the zoom when the zoom was basically unusable on the S3 because it got so blurry. Processing speeds are great, haven't had any glitches, delays, or freezes at all. Battery life is splendid so far, I've been going a day and a half without charging it and don't need to turn on power saving mode or turn off data/wifi to conserve battery. The speed charging function is also really cool, charging overnight is just overkill it takes less than 2 hours for a full charge. In the end it was more expensive than I would've liked but is a great product and hopefully it continues to be worth the price!:2016-07-08:phoneuser9123534756674

Samsung Galaxy S7:Very easy to use.:I have had this for only a week but my old version was the Samsung s4 which is very similar so it was really easy to get going on it. I like the longer battery time and it interfaces better and  quicker with the apps I use. Haven't tried all of the new features yet,  but will be working on it. Seems more intuitive than my older version was.  Would recommend.:2016-07-07:Midsouthlady

Samsung Galaxy S7:Upgrade from Samsung Galaxy S3 to S7:Since upgrading from my Samsung Galaxy S3 to the new S7, every aspect of the phone is an improvement. Not that I didn't like the S3 - I did, but it was getting outdated and had trouble with reception out of area and went through batteries like a candy addict goes through Skittles. I am so glad that I upgraded. The ease of transition was simple, though I'm still learning new things about the phone. Battery lasts me a day, and I'm able to use the phone anywhere without signal issues. YAY!:2016-07-07:Penny Parker

Samsung Galaxy S7:A great phone and very easy to use.:I have had a Galaxy S5 for the past two years and my wife another make and model.  Her having another make and model was a huge mistake.  Her phone had to be replaced once and both gave her fits the whole two years.  Upgrading us both to the S7, which we have had now for just over a week, was a very smart thing to do.  Both phones are working great.  The only complaint I have is that they, as well as seemingly any smart phone, come with apps that are just not needed and take up space.:2016-07-07:callushappy

Samsung Galaxy S7:Wife's first smart phone:It's my wife's first smart phone. She only had a texting phone before. She loves it! Yeah, maybe the S7 is a lot of phone for the first one, but it was the same price as the S6 and S5, so why not. We've had no problems with it and she's learning she can do just about everything she can do on her Chromebook.:2016-07-06:Lugh

Samsung Galaxy S7:Super fast, longer lasting battery:I got my phone a week ago and have been experimenting with it since then.  In many ways, it's quite similar to my previous phone (Galaxy S4) but in other ways totally different.  I am impressed with how fast the processor on the phone works as well as how fast it charges.  I also like the longer life of the battery.  I'm having some issues with how it syncs email from some of my accounts.  When mail is deleted from the Exchange Server, it deletes properly from the phone.  However, when mail is deleted from another server, it remains on my phone.  Either the sync doesn't recognize the mail is gone or there is a feature somewhere that I have yet to find to toggle.  All in all, I am super impressed with this phone, with its features, and with its camera as well!  I am not disappointed that I have purchased it.:2016-07-05:Mike Y

Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the New Features and Battery Life:"I traded up from the S5 (which gave me great service for two years) to the S7. I am finding the battery life to be more than adequate, even better than my expectations. I like that the calendar and clock apps have been updated, I like that the date, time, and battery usage all show on the phone without the screen being ""on."" The dimensions are better for me... it seems a bit narrower and lighter. The added storage capacity is most welcome. The transfer of data (contacts, messages, etc.) was quite simple with the provided transfer dongle.":2016-07-05:tuffcookie

Samsung Galaxy S7:Outstanding phone!:"I've had my S7 just over a week and couldn't be happier with it!  I upgraded from an HTC One M8 which was a great phone all its own for some time.  But after experiencing excessive lagging, random freezes and app hangs, and degradation of the touch screen from normal wear and tear over the past 18 mos, I decided to upgrade.  After much research, both online and in talking to friends and co-workers who'd recently purchased new phones (both Android and Apple), I decided on the Galaxy S7.  The screen is bold and bright, it handles every app I've loaded with nary a hiccup, it's compatible with my existing chargers and cords, and the wireless charging is a great feature.  Oh, and it also survived TWO unplanned and unintended drops onto pavement prior to purchasing a protective case for it!  :)":2016-06-28:SoCalBoiler
Samsung Galaxy S7:Better than the iPhone and previous S series:The core processor of this phone works like a beauty, I don't think I have not been more satisfied until I got this phone on my own line!:2016-06-28:Aithxr
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition to new phone, but missing some old features would rate 4 1/2 stars:The battery life is great, but I miss the single step copy/paste and the setting in the camera that allowed photos by pressing anywhere on the screen.  The new cut and paste requires you to do a screen shot and then paste it.  In the past all you did is select copy and then put it wherever you want.  Not game changers, but definitely wish programmers would stop changing things that work.:2016-06-28:LoriBR

Samsung Galaxy S7:Beautiful machine, love the fingerprint security, wish more settings would transfer:The phone is powerful and sleek, the microSD slot is back, and I love the fingerprint security and fast charging most. I wish Samsung's Smartswitch would have transferred more actual settings and passwords--not just the apps themselves--but at least it gets you halfway there. It takes a few hours to customize everything to your liking, but it rocks once it's all set up.:2016-06-21:rdesalvo

I can be on the phone most of the day using video and sound functions and the battery easily lasts with room to spare.:2016-06-20:Dawnfwc
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesome Product!!!!!:The day my wife and I purchased the phones  we tried out video meaning we can see each other on the phone as we speak,  the S7 is amazing phone I had the S4 and my wife had the S4 mini and let me tell you much better, the camera take awesome pictures. the only thing I don't like is when they installed the glass part to put over the glass itself  to protect the screen is too short, does not cover the sides too well. Thank you:2016-06-20:MichaelandKathy

Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy move from Motorola:Great phone. Easy to use and very clear screen and pictures.  The camera works great.  Much better phone that my previous Motorola.  I did buy a cover since the phone is very slick.  I didn't want to risk breaking since it is very expensive.  However, the gorilla glass is supposed to protect it -- you can't be too careful with a $$$ phone.:2016-06-20:Samsung Convert

I miss a few features from my previous phone, but I'm finding apps to compensate.  If you're looking for a solid flagship phone, this is it.:2016-06-20:XMotoUser
Samsung Galaxy S7:So far......really good!:"I just recently purchased this phone and can't give a longevity review, but I can say this phone far exceeded any expectations I had before I purchased it! It has been an easy transition from my previous phone. I was able to get the gold color. With the wall paper available on the phone itself, it makes for a nice appearance. Am pleased with the battery performance (texting, calling,&YouTube). The battery really does ""charge fast"" as advertised. The screen and audio are also very well put together. I am very glad I made this investment! :)":2016-06-20:Belulah

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great new features:I appreciate having the new selfie option 2 just touch the heart monitor.

We do miss the hover feature that was available on the Galaxy S5 it is missing on the Galaxy S7.:2016-06-18:Datsunlives
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use:Replaced  my old Motorola RazorMaxx with the S7. Have a Samsung tablet so the transition was easy.  It's a little bigger but so thin that you don't notice. Discharges faster but running a lot more apps.:2016-06-18:tiatoo

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features and improvements to access various functions.:"The phone came with the extra accessory of an external charger... yay!!   I also submitted the form to receive the 'free' VR Gear (6-8 weeks before delivery). Really fast access to Google, and the Camera for front/rear view shots... a plus.  Only complaints are:   1) My email inbox no longer shows ALL items... i.e., some emails that are new (but dated last month), and some that are old, but I kept for reference. 2) I don't use my phone a lot, but still have to charge the battery every 1 to 1-1/2 days. Only gave the 'performance' 4 stars because that might be and issue for heavy-users who would have to charge more often.":2016-06-18:SKN11
Samsung Galaxy S7:Switched from iPhone.:I was reluctant to switch from iPhone to Samsung but I am so glad I did. It was easy to learn the system and the screen is so much bigger and easier to read.

My fiance has the iPhone S6 Edge and that thing is great. However, I decided to trust Samsung and give the 7 a try and it is amazing. The feel in my hands and the look of the phone is unmatched.

Samsung Galaxy S7:Improved in everyway:Only had the phone 2 weeks, but what I have noticed the most is power consumption is half what the Galaxy S5 was.  Although I have not placed as many apps on the phone's main screens.  Someone shared with me, those apps use the phone's RAM and draw on power because they are always loaded.  So far, the phone is good to go.  Just make sure you have all your info backed up and your SD card unmounted before you take it out.  My customer service rep who sold me the phone didn't do that and well...pretty much lost everything on the SD card.  Not the best.:2016-06-10:Coo1mcd

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great new features, lots more speed!:This phone feels familiar and operates very much like my Galaxy S4.  I like the higher quality materials as well.  I don't like the non-removable battery, but that's not a deal breaker.  The fingerprint scanner, NFC and magnetic-stripe emulator features are extremely cool.  The speed is greatly increased over my old phone and battery life is better even if I leave Wifi and GPS turned on all the time.  There are some pretty nice camera updates as well.  So many new features to explore, I'm sure this will keep me busy for a while.  I wasn't dissatisfied with my old S4 long term so it's highly unlikely I'll find anything to complain about on this S7.:2016-06-07:OldSchool1965

Samsung Galaxy S7:Excelent all-a-round phone:"I previously used a Motorola Turbo (original) which I liked better than my wife's iPhone 6s.   My brother-in-law encouraged me to try a Samsung G7.  I am very glad I did.  The phone was easy to set up except for fine-tuning the ""Contacts"" - I have multiples g-mail accounts (I turned on ONLY the g-mail accounts and not the phone ""native"" accounts).   My only disappointment is the battery is not as long lasting as the Droid Turbo, however,  I carefully reviewed each app and turned off many that I was not using.  Result, better battery life and the phone was not as warm.  After 10 days, I am thinking this phone is the greatest!":2016-06-05:D5650

Battery is good with rapid charge option, lasts long if you properly close out of apps. Im constantly on my phone and battery lasts. Only one thing i dont care for is when you turn on bluetooth it turns off the wifi, but no big deal. Great phone. Do advise in buying an otter box phone case, phone is on the thin side.:2016-06-05:Great S7

Samsung Galaxy S7:So far, so good:This phone is way better than the very old smart phone I had previously - faster, brighter, bigger screen.  The only issue I'm having is that I miss the menu button that was on my old phone.  I know I can do a long press on the return button to display a menu for many applications but it doesn't work with all of them.  I haven't found a way around this so it's preventing me from using one of my very favorite games.:2016-06-03:MEM05

Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy s7:Love the phone a lot.:2016-06-02:Greywolf74
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features!:Love the phone. Android has pretty much always outdone Apple when it comes to customizablilty on their phones (keyboard fonts, wallpapers, external sounds for alerts). I have an iPhone 6s Plus as my primary phone and the S7 as my secondary as it has features I can't use on the iPhone and vice versa. The selling point was the NFC for Samsung Pay (downside is they aren't partnered with too many banks yet) and the ability to use apps not available on Apple (especially for my tamagotchi pets that use NFC):2016-06-02:LenD

I can find nothing to complain about.  The the fast charger this phone comes with is great! Charges very quickly!   The phone can also be charged on a dock.  Im thinking about purchasing the dock for convenience.:2016-05-27:CaseNFlorida

Samsung Galaxy S7:Better than my old phone that had a bad battery sensor.:I'm not certain how I feel about this phone yet.  Activating  it at Best Buy used up 82% of my data for the month so I won't be surfing the web on this phone until next month.  So far, however, when I'm connected to the charger at home I found that the phone is quick to respond to my touch and I'm really happy with the 32GB storage capacity.  Being able to purchase the phone at a substantial discount (I have really good credit with Verizon) didn't hurt either.:2016-05-26:Smitty Smith

Samsung Galaxy S7:Was relatively easy - there's a lot no one tells you, like how to find widgets (my son told me):"I've only had it a week.

Samsung Galaxy S7:I love this phone!!:First of all, selfies is what's in and I the the face front camera (I call it the selfie camera, lol). Front and back camera is clear as ever! The battery life is really long lasting and trust me I am ALWAYS on my phone. I upgraded from my S5 because the the S7 has a better camera and because the S7 is water resistant like the S5. I did not upgrade to the S6 because it was not water resistant  (yes, that matters). I'm enjoying every bit of this phone and it's in my favorite color, GOLD!!:2016-05-24:Janiqua
Samsung Galaxy S7:Greaty Improvements:I bought this as an upgrade from the S4.  The sound quality is magnificent compared to my old phone.  My wife LOVES the video chat feature that comes standard.  It reacts quickly, doesn't feel like a small tablet (only a hair larger than the S4), and is water resistant (haven't tested that yet, but my phones have a tendency to go swimming so that was a plus out of the gate).:2016-05-24:DaPatriot

Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy S7:Be cause I use my phone on my boat so much, I have reluctant to use anything that wasn't totally waterproof.  The Galaxy S7 with the water proof LIFEPROOF case does fits the need.  I have used Kyocera and Casio phones because of their ruggedness.  But it doesn't take much to slow them down.  I need my navigation, weather, and business apps to conduct my business on the boat.  The S7 is just what I needed.:2016-05-24:CptnRob

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, stop preloading it with garbage.:"So I've noticed that all my Verizon smartphones have included gradually more and more preloaded apps that are worthless. It's the reason that older generations of people generally feel intimidated by the smartphone experience, they are overwhelmed by all the garbage icons that they see.   So how about this: instead of making it a ritual where I have to manually hide or uninstall all these useless apps before my mom can use her new phone, you just don't include it. Then she can download her own apps and not feel exasperated that she doesn't know what Milk Music is or why she continually needs to download updates for it.":2016-05-24:Sarabeth

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great! Easy to use!:So far I really like this phone. It was an easy transition from the galaxy s4. I was a little concerned it would be a lot different. It's definitely an upgrade and most features are easier to use and get used to. The screen is a little longer but its very similar in size. I think my favorite is the upgrade with the camera- much easier to use and takes better pictures. I'm still figuring out some of the features and learning more about it but I don't really have any negatives.:2016-05-24:WhitneyS
Samsung Galaxy S7:Thought I would Give The Samsung S7 A Try Said The Old iPhone User:I was waiting to purchase the iPhone SE, as I like the small size of the iPhone 5.  Then, my iPad bricked on me with an OS update. so I said time to try Android. My life is tied to Google this and Google that so why not commit for a two year streach and see what these Samsung S7 units were all about. So i made the Jump...:2016-05-24:RanchBoy

Samsung Galaxy S7:Very easy to use!:"I'm impressed with this phone, granted I upgraded from a much older, very slow smart phone.  I really like the fingerprint unlock feature as it works very quickly when I need to access the phone.  This phone runs very fast and efficiently and pairs extremely well with bluetooth devices. I experienced my first HD phone call on it yesterday was quite please with the call quality.  I am enjoying it. Recommendation: In many reviews, people talk about the back of it getting smudged with fingerprints very easily.  This is true.  I recommend getting a good cover for it.  The one I got from Seidio is very well done and still allows the phone to be thin enough easily fit in my pocket.  A cover also makes it easier to hold.":2016-05-18:Pelsa

Samsung Galaxy S7:samsung 7:It is a good phone I really like it:2016-05-12:817 6
Samsung Galaxy S7:great phone:camera is incredible. I zoomed in on my son water skying from in the bouncy boat and the video came out great. the battery last a long time and the charger that came with the phone charges in under 2 hours.:2016-05-12:dOmaha
Samsung Galaxy S7:Cool and current. The loss of my S5 turned into an unexpected boost...:Very smooth and intuitive. I'm glad that Samsung returned to allowing additional memory to be added in the S7. It's very slick, connects seamlessly with virtually every Bluetooth item I own, and controls the Sonos system I've got connected @ home flawlessly.:2016-05-12:azmaxx
Samsung Galaxy S7:No complaints so far:Upgraded from my S5 about a week ago, and I'm pleased with it. The 4K display is great, and the re-positioning of the speaker is much appreciated (on the bottom of the case rather than the back). Looking forward to examining more of the new features.:2016-05-11:InsideVoice
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Device:These are our first Smart phones. Easy to learn how to use. We stepped up from our old basic phones. Great features. Only issue is the battery life. I guess we were used to the old phones. Still on the learning curve for all the phones features.:2016-05-11:Easy Tech
Samsung Galaxy S7:Excellent:I've had this phone a little more than a couple weeks with noo issues. Battery life is great compared to my old S4. Phone is very fast and very clear on calls. Hd camera is absolutely amazing! Another plus is it's waterproof! Perfect for my work. Thank you Verizon and Samsung, another home run!:2016-05-11:plamarre
Samsung Galaxy S7:Superb!:By far the best phone I've owned. Long time Samsung customer and couldn't be more pleased.:2016-05-10:Jbridges05
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the phone:Had to replace my Galaxy S5:2016-05-10:SunnieFLA
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very nice phone, was easy to transfer from the note 4 to the S7:"So far no complaints about the phone it is so much nicer than my note4 was, only had it a week and so far no issues!!! But then again i was on another carrier with my note4 and I think that had alot to do with it :)":2016-05-10:notenoughair
Samsung Galaxy S7:Seamless transition:This phone transitioned with my galaxy 5 in minutes. It's got more customization options and so far has been issue free.:2016-05-09:Powell83
Samsung Galaxy S7:I've had the phone for a month, and I love it.:This phone was an upgrade from an older, smaller phone, and it performs better in every way. The excellent high resolution screen makes it easier to browse and use internet apps. The camera is superb and performs well in dim light. I don't put a heavy demand on the battery, but it last significantly longer than my old phone. The internal memory is enough for many usable apps and a lots of photos. No regrets.:2016-05-08:Bill1h
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features:I love it. It's easy to use.:2016-05-08:Maricruz624
Samsung Galaxy S7:A big improvement:"It's certainly a big step up from my old Galaxy S3 Mini! The battery holds power for a long time and can fully recharge in less than an hour -- very important for me. The screen is the perfect size (my screen protector doesn't completely fit, but it hasn't been a problem for me); there's finally a reason to use the ""menu"" button on the bottom left; it feels intuitive to use; I like how well it responds to my touch; the camera is absolutely amazing; and the sound is strong and clear. Totally happy with it so far.":2016-05-08:seanm4
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:Have only had the phone a week and I absolutely love it. Couldnt be any happier.:2016-05-07:Jackie92
Samsung Galaxy S7:Like it:No problems. Bought it April 29th.:2016-05-07:DNMIM
Samsung Galaxy S7:i love my phone!:I bought it a week ago! I used to use galaxy s4, and s7 is so much greater than the s4!. The camera is great! There are many options to take pictures.The sound is nice and loud. I like how i can use fingerprint to unlock the phone. Oh and the battery life is way longer compared to s4. The best part is I can customize many things. I can change the theme, size of the keyboard, size of the screen, etc. And the phone itself is pretty, so i just got a clear phone case. I didn't check the waterproof because i'm afraid it might work. But I really like my phone. And my friend got this phone too after using mine for a day.:2016-05-04:shcho91
Samsung Galaxy S7:Verizon is Great !:I opened up new service last month and I was so impressed with the phone and also with Verizon's Customer Service. Great Job!:2016-05-04:Art1966
Samsung Galaxy S7:Was an easy transition from the S6 to the S7.:I've only had the phone for a week or so and so far so good! Still learning new features and experimenting with the awesome camera! The only problem I'm having is getting the text message alert and the default notifications working properly.:2016-05-04:Catrina456
Samsung Galaxy S7:Well worth the wait.:I finally upgraded from my S4 as I could no longer take the phone refusing to reconnect to cell towers after losing a signal without rebooting, 6 hour battery life adn the constant disconnect from my car's bluetooth. I've had the S7 for over a week now. The battery lasts me over 2 days! I just can't believe it. Granted my usage may be low, but my previous phone didn't even last a full working day. Perhaps I shouldn't be so impressed, maybe the S7 is just working as it should where my S4 didn't work properly from the get go. Pictures are clear, I like some of the new gadets, but miss some too (flashlight icon to put on homescreen). The fingerprint sensor works shockingly well (I was very skeptical based on previous experience with bad biometric hardware). I am glad Samsung replaced the removable SD card, but wonder WHY they don't allow it to act as seemless storage (it's only good for storing videos and photos, it doesn't act like seemless internal storage - read cnet and other reviews). The build quality is fantastic although the slight beveling on the front screen does cause most tempered glass protectors to look like they have bubbles around the edges.:2016-05-03:bowgross
Samsung Galaxy S7:The Galaxy S7 exceeded my expections.:From the time I started using the Galaxy S7 I knew I made the right choice. From it's quality construction, to it's fast performance, I knew I made the right choice switching from my previous Galaxy S6. 1. The camera- wonderful images crisp quality with great resolution and accurate color rendering. 2. The bright, clear screen is viewable in all sorts of light, inside and out. 3. The battery life is definitely a plus with plenty of full day use. 4. The advantage of a SD card for storing media, photos, videos and music is a definitely plus. Finally, it is a phone, and when I make calls they go through consistently and the conversations are clear with no unwanted digital or analog noises. So, if you are looking for a great new phone I recommend the Galaxy S7 to anyone in the market or looking for a replacement to their current phone.:2016-05-01:HBR3
Samsung Galaxy S7:Please that I decided to upgrade early despite the cost.:I very pleased I decided to upgrade very early despite the cost. My primary reason for upgrading early in my contract was the expandable memory the Galaxy S7 has that the Galaxy S6 does not have. I am very pleased with the features/advanced features the Galaxy S7 has compared to the S6. A more advanced camera system, much more memory capability, a battery that lasts longer, clearer pictures and a more advanced system than the S6.:2016-04-30:livieR
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone:I recently upgraded to the s7 from a RazorM. Yes, it was a huge upgrade. I've read all of the 'complaints' from other users, but I have not experienced any of them. The phone is working great. The battery life is lasting for days, the network and wifi connections have been continuous. Granted, I'm not glued to my phone like most folks, which might be why my battery lasts so much longer, but my old phone would die just sitting on my desk. So this is a big improvement. It also charges super fast.:2016-04-30:bzryan
Samsung Galaxy S7:I Strongly Recommend This Phone:I bought this phone a month ago and LOVE IT, better camera, excellent screen, fast, water resistance and more. LOVE IT:2016-04-30:yruiz8
Samsung Galaxy S7:Super fast and intuitive!:"I'm coming from a Galaxy s4, so seeing how it's ""grown up"" is wonderful. Navigation is easier (double click for a photo), picture quality is unmatched,navigation is super easy and the battery life is double what I had. Moving info from one phone to the next was truly seamless. I'm a ""Galaxy Girl""!":2016-04-29:kayakqueen
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone:I have only had this phone for a week, but I am glad I upgraded to the S7 it works flawlessly. I have added a 128gb sd card and 4000 songs and the phones bluetooth has had no problems connecting to my Ram truck, my LG sound bar, my JBL speaker, or my parrot head set. I fish a lot so the water proof is a bonus since you never know when you me be caught out in a heavy rain.:2016-04-29:BigHillCountryCamper
Samsung Galaxy S7:So easy to transfer other phone:I love battery life and talking to another person:2016-04-29:45472novass
Samsung Galaxy S7:Vast improvement from LG G2:I have had my S7 about a week, and so far I love it. Compared to my old LG G2, it rocks. Very quick and responsive with the speedy processor, 4 GB RAM, and Marshmallow Android. With the SD card slot (which my G2 did not have) and the wireless charging, this upgrade was a no-brainer for me. Battery life is equal to or better than my G2--plenty of juice to get most users through a day.:2016-04-28:JWK72
Samsung Galaxy S7:A real phone to love:I have had this phone for 8 days and I love it. I had an LG tribute which admittedly is a cheap phone but it had decent specs. This phone however blows that one into oblivion. It's like going from roller skates into a sports car. I can honestly say I haven't had any issues with the phone's app performance. The camera is amazing. It focuses so fast and it the pics are so beautifully sharp. I feel this phone is almost perfect and it's making me kind of arrogant because it's so awesome I keep telling people about it without them even asking! Also, I used to think what's the big deal about cellphones. They all do the same things and basically look the same. That was my mindset until I started using this baby. I feel like I'm holding a long lost treasure. I have the gold version and I love looking at it let alone using it. It's kind of hypnotic. I said earlier that this phone is almost perfect, because the main thing that it is supposed to do which is phone calls, is definitely lacking. I have had multiple people tell me that they couldn't hear me very well and that I was cutting in and out but I could hear them just fine. That really irks me because I like smartphones but I believe above all else any phone should not have major issues with calls. Instead this phone is like an awesome portable computer with a poorly working phone built into it. I still gave it 5 stars because I think that the call quality is not a deal breaker considering how amazing everything else about the phone is. Also it's totally possible that the reception is an issue from Verizon where I live rather than the phone itself. For me the S7 lives up to the hype!:2016-04-28:mikey0825
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the phone and the features!:I just got this last week, but I love it!!!:2016-04-28:MommyNick
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice sleek phone!:Easy to learn as it was so similar old s5. Pretty! Keyboard is improved.:2016-04-27:Dandyboots
Samsung Galaxy S7:So far, so great:I went from the S4 to the Note 5 to the S7. I am very happy with this phone so far. The screen is incredible, and so is the camera. The SD card slot is great and very useful. So far, I have had no trouble with it. I get a strong signal on 4G, wifi, bluetooth. Voice calls have been solid in both directions. As for the battery life, I'm not having the terrible experience that I see others reporting. I'd suggest going through your settings and tweaking a few things to improve battery life. There are quite a few good articles that come up in a Google search that will help.:2016-04-27:Mahoogalies
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy S7:I am very pleased with my new phone. I previously had an IPhone5 and was not at all pleased with it. I am big on the swipe feature for texting and the IPhone didn't allow that.  Also, the camera on this new phone is amazing. In love with the pictures it takes. Will never go back to an IPhone again.:2016-04-27:Lulu1267
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone!:I should qualify this review by saying that for 2+ years I was using the Samsung Stratosphere II, so this phone seems very high tech in comparison (and this is a BRAND new phone for me, so take this review with a grain of salt)! It has LOTS of features, it's fast, and the battery life is really long. I also like that the screen is not TOO big. Some of the notifications are different from my last phone, so I'll need to see how I can change that; if you're not really into technology like me, you may need help setting up certain parts of this phone.:2016-04-26:KEArion
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use, battery length and size of screen.:I bought this phone a week ago to replace an S6 that met the pavement and shattered.:2016-04-26:Ebenn6
Samsung Galaxy S7:Most powerful phone on the market:Absolutely love this phone. Have had no issues with any features of it. Battery is reliable and with the fast charging, takes about an hour to go from 0-100%. Camera quality is amazing, processing speed is lightning fast. All and all the besst phone i've ever had:2016-04-26:derrick_vand27
Samsung Galaxy S7:Back to a Galaxy again:"I originally wanted the s7 for the larger battery, SD card slot and water resistance. The phone has all day battery and I'm not jumping to go dunk my phone in the water. Double tap the home button and the camera is off and going fast. Fingerprint scanner is amazingly fast although I don't really use it except to verify a purchase. If Touch Wiz isn't your thing, it's incredibly easy to load keyboards, launchers, that are more to your liking (I prefer Google keyboard and voice to text it comes with). The things that Samsung offers with this keyboard really change the look of the phone. There are several free options to choose from or you can buy one to your liking. Wireless charging is another win, charging my phone through an Otterbox Defender case. Fast charging with the stock charger works and charges more quickly than wireless (I used my old Verizon tilt charger from my last phone rather than buy a Samsung fast wireless charger). If you have a bunch of mini USB/wireless charging accessories, they should all work with this phone which is actually another reason I picked the s7. Call quality through Bluetooth and with the phone itself is excellent. Samsung Milk Music is worth the nominal monthly fee for no ads, no DJ, and the ability to stream music without burning up internet, it does it offline through the app. Gaming is good, I've heard people comment about covering the speaker but I've had no problems whatsoever. There is a dedicated gaming app that allows you to block notifications, record and share your gaming experience if that's your thing. Speaker is clear and sounds like what a single cellphone speaker should, no issues with speakerphone, but don't expect stereo quality. Overall I'm really happy with the smaller form factor even being at bifocal age coming from a Nexus 6 with a 6"" screen. I can read everything clearly. I wish they had offered more than 32 GB of phone storage but the SD card makes up for that considering all the other benefits of the s7.":2016-04-26:qwerty069
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy S7 is a Great Phone:I've only used the Galaxy S7 for one week, but it has been perfect so far. This is a no lag phone with good battery life and the camera is awesome. Voice quality is perfect and for me Verizon is Excellent:2016-04-25:Redup1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7:Slim, lightweight, easy operating system. I was looking for a model with a battery that would last all day using my camera, apps, etc. I would definitely recommend! Camera is great! Team at Verizon inside of Westmoreland Mall near Greensburg, PA were exceptional and displayed great customer service! They definitely know what they are talking about! Walked me through the IPhone and Galaxy and explained different features and benefits! Won't shop anywhere else!:2016-04-25:Jewels711
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very Well Designed Phone:Up to now, the only thing the Iphone had that was better than Android was the build quality of the phone. The S7 changes that. It surpasses the quality of the Iphone, plus Touchwiz is much lighter and less intrusive. It actually focuses on useful tweaks and additions to Android. It's a pleasure to use. (sd card slot and water resistance are bonuses):2016-04-25:MBramble
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesome Phone!:After owning the S6 as my first Samsung phone I swore I'd NEVER own another Samsung. I'm so glad I have then another chance! The S7 holds the charge and phone calast are crystal clear! Great job Samsung!:2016-04-24:IdaRee
Samsung Galaxy S7:Everything is better:Got the phone three weeks ago. Battery life is very good. Anyone who complains about dropped calls just needs to turn off the HD voice feature. Small problem no big deal. Speed is great. No complaints.:2016-04-23:pmat47
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very happy with my S7:I bought this phone when it first came out and love it! Easy to use with a lot of features. The camera is great, battery life is great, and I am very happy with my S7!:2016-04-23:Melflo77

Samsung Galaxy S7:I love this S7!:I have had this phone a couple of weeks. I don't yet know how to use all the features, but I am learning. It is easy to use and easier to learn than the S4 was. Also the battery life is better than the S4 but it still barely make it through the day. That would be my only criticism of this phone.:2016-04-21:pachy girl 13
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it:I can't say enough great things about this phone. I feel like it's made my life easier.:2016-04-21:Tasha1009
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone! Great up grade from my previous phone (Motorala Max Hd):Great screen, long battery life, EXCELLENT camera and some great features! A great improvement from my previous phone.:2016-04-21:Randy100
Samsung Galaxy S7:Better than any other:Great phone very pleased except that, just like the S5 people have a hard time hearing me and for no reason the call drops and then comes back. That is annoying! No matter what better than the iPhone.:2016-04-21:Gyllyn
Samsung Galaxy S7:Better than iPhone:I traded my iPhone in for the Galaxy 7 a week ago. To me this is much easier to use and has more & better features. I love it!:2016-04-21:Llm177
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use and full of access to all kinds of things...the complete package!:I have had the phone for a few weeks and I love it. It took some getting used to--my previous phone was an S3--but even that was doable. It's pricey, but I think it is worth it for the sophistication, storage, and speed.:2016-04-21:ArtWS
Samsung Galaxy S7:Must have phone:Love this phone. S health is awesome. Great picture quality.:2016-04-21:FrogBennett

Samsung Galaxy S7:Best phone I've ever had! LOVE IT!!:Almost went with the new iphone but I'm so glad I didn't. It has all their features with the best of being an android..:2016-04-20:jewelzz828
Samsung Galaxy S7:Absolutely Love It!:I have only owned a smart phone for 1 year (an S3). The S7 is leaps and bounds ahead of the S3 (Duh!) My kids and my parents have never had smart phones and we are all SOOO excited. The camera is amazing! I don't need to worry about carrying another camera with me now. I love that I can reach my kids in places that our dumb phones didn't have reception. Love all the apps too! I have not had problems with the battery life, but I charge it every night and it lasts all day. For my family that can't seem to stop playing with them, they have to charge during the day sometimes. I am a Samsung fan and would recommend the S7 to anyone.:2016-04-19:Peppy1969
Samsung Galaxy S7:Excellent phone:Very quick camera takes great pics. The best phone screen that exists. Wireless fast charging is as fast as plug in. Battery lasts all day. Touch wiz is great on this phone. Love it!!:2016-04-19:Brad shoemaker

Samsung Galaxy S7:HD sound is GREAT!:My husband dreaded getting a new phone but the S7 made it easy for him. He really likes the HD sound. We also got one for my mother-in-law and we love that she can connect to her Wi-fi to make phone calls at home because she doesn't get cell reception there. We're also impressed with the battery life.:2016-04-17:Faerywings7

Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice upgrade from s5:Been using the new phone for almost 2 weeks and have had 0 issues. Its fast and so far has been a nice upgrade from my older s5. the Camera is super fast and clear, much better than my old phone. minor complaints i have is the power button being a little lower and the slight curve of the phone and how the zagg glass screen protector doesn't bond well on the sides. other than that, i would recommend the purchase of the phone if asked and i'm happy with my new phone.:2016-04-14:Garb
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone So Far:I bought my S7 a few days ago and I love it. A great upgrade from an S4. I love the fingerprint capabilities.

Samsung Galaxy S7:Perfect Companion to a Lifeproof Case:Everything Samsung left out in the S6 they brought back with the S7 (except Exynos). I purchased a Lifeproof case as well, even tho the phone is already water resistant it just adds extra protection. Phone is fast and the MicroSD Card slow is nice! Battery life is also improved, but as all phones could be better for heavy users and stamina people.:2016-04-13:wireproof

Samsung Galaxy S7:Super easy to navigate:Smart design, great speed, easy navigation, and so much more. Totally love this new phone. Phone works in areas that other phones do not.

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features, looks beautiful and easy to use.:I just bought this last week and absolutely love it. I got a black one and got a gold color one for my son and he loves it too. I think gold color phone looks a bit more elegant. had the S4 for 2 years and upgraded to this. I love the fact that they put the speaker on the side next to charging port on S7. Crystal clear pics and display.:2016-04-12:PKaru

Samsung Galaxy S7:I am probably WOWed going from a RAZR flip phone:I haven't had it 2 weeks yet and I like it. The camera is great and all the features! It is replacing my phone and Jet Pack. I don't need both when one does both functions and more. I am also freed from the laptop because I can do most anything on the Galaxy S7. Also I can do things the laptop can't do.:2016-04-10:CharlieP4629
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy upgrade from Galaxy S4:I purchased this phone from Bestbuy. The activation process was extremely easy.

Samsung Galaxy S7:Much improved over S6:"Husband loves the new phone. He jumped on board with the S6 while I kept the S5. My battery life has always been much better and he had an issue dropping calls on the S5 unless the higher call features were on. However, when you turned those on, you couldn't talk and email/text/use the GPS at the same time. Everything is all fixed with the S7! Battery life is back, all the features work again, and his phone is faster than my S5 - which makes him happy having the superior phone :) Boys with toys.":2016-04-08:amy0711
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use, excellent Camera and Processor:Switched to Verizon and got the S7 and a second one for my girlfriend for free. We absolutely love this phone. Camera is excellent, lot of great features, speaker is awesome. Call quality could be a BIT better but thats less to do with the phone. Recommened:2016-04-08:Eldar987
Samsung Galaxy S7:Best Phone:"I bought this phone on pre order. The battery lasts almost 24 hours. the trick is in settings: Go to Display and Wallpaper, scroll to Screen Mode and change it to either AMOLED photo (I use that) or AMOLED Cinema. It comes set on Adaptive display which does eat the battery. Fast processor, beautiful photos, clear calls. Seems to have the best features of all phones! I have had Iphones, Droids, and Galaxy. I highly recommend this one!":2016-04-08:Lisarobin53
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone!!!:I went from a Galaxy S3 to a S7 so it was quite a change for me. So far I love it. Easy to maneuver around the screens. Fast processor. Takes great pictures.:2016-04-07:KRP_
Samsung Galaxy S7:Highly recommend!:Great phone with many features! The camera works better than my digital camera. The sound on videos and phone features is clear with a beautiful display. The phone charges quickly.:2016-04-07:SLVS
Samsung Galaxy S7:Look No Further!:There is a reason Samsung's S7 & S7 Edge Rate #1 These phones are amazing!:2016-04-07:Samantha1995
Samsung Galaxy S7:Had a Samsung before, this is so much better:There is a lot I do not do with a phone, but I am certainly glad I have one of these:2016-04-06:Mannyh
Samsung Galaxy S7:After having a mini droid this is like stepping up into a Cadillac of phones!!!:I've had it for a little over a week and really like it. It's sleek and has really nice features and takes the most AMAZING pictures....:2016-04-06:JD60
Samsung Galaxy S7:Faster, sharper, longer charge:Have had it for a week. WHY DID I WAIT? Not too big (bigger than the III), incredibly quick. Like it a lot.:2016-04-05:bek47
Samsung Galaxy S7:Switched to S7 from iPhone and so glad that I did.:"I got this phone 10 days ago, and I absolutely love it. I decided to go with something other than my iPhone, as I wanted expandable storage. (I had a few other gripes about the iPhone that I won't get into). I was a little reluctant to try Android, as I was afraid that it would be less user-friendly. After about one day of using it, I was hooked on this phone.  Pros:  -- Beautiful screen with vivid colors -- Size is about perfect for me. I don't want anything bigger. -- It's really fast. Apps open and run very quickly. Fingerprint recognition is really fast. -- I could write a ton on ease of use. It's very easy to navigate and do stuff. In my opinion, even easier than an iPhone. I love the ability to close all Apps at once by clicking a single button. It's so easy to transfer files (such as music) from your PC by just clicking and dragging. Bye-bye iTunes and all it's issues! -- Battery life is about the same as an iPhone, based on my usage profile. You can get a full day's worth of use without recharging if you aren't on it constantly, and/or playing games. -- You can get a lot of extra battery life by activating Power Save Mode. -- Charges in about 1 hour and 15 minutes with fast charger. -- Camera is awesome.  Cons:  -- No easy way to sync with Outlook for contacts. There are some 3rd party apps that do this, but they aren't as good as iTunes. -- Slow motion video camera doesn't allow you to zoom. Kind of a bummer if your are doing sports video.":2016-04-05:Stew67
Samsung Galaxy S7:S4 to S7:I've been eligible for upgrade since last year, but I waited specifically for this phone because I knew it'd be worth it! Though I'm still disappointed Samsung made the decision not to release a white colored phone here in the US (as it's personally my favorite color), I'm really loving the gold color and how it changes tone in different lighting! The fingerprint visibility is unfortunately very high, but it isn't a deal breaker. The phone itself is great and an incredible upgrade from the S4 (which I have loved dearly over these last two years); the size is only an inch bigger and it's more narrow than the S4, which is a plus for someone with small hands like me! The battery life is SUCH an upgrade from the S4, and though I don't think it's quite as good as advertised and reviewed, it's still fantastic. The longest I've gone without a charge (and I haven't even let it fully die yet) is well over 8 hours, and even then it was only down to 15% with extremely heavy use. The camera on this phone is fantastic, too; I have no idea what the S6 camera was like, but the S4 was far from cutting edge. I spent a day taking pictures in various lighting and every single one has turned out great! I'm also extremely glad that expandable storage is back because it's a necessity these days. My only complaint is that I did not receive an SD Card Tray Removal Tool with my phone like I was supposed to, and since I live in a dorm with significantly less things around than I would have had at home, I ended up having to unbend a staple to get it open. The phone is fantastic, and the fast charger included is REALLY fast - it literally charges my phone 10% in five minutes. I haven't tested the extent of water resistance yet, but one of my friends got the phone as well and was bold enough to pour a cup of water over it with no damage whatsoever, so it looks like it's well done! I really, really adore this phone. Another great Samsung product!:2016-04-05:armyash13
Samsung Galaxy S7:It really is waterproof and beerproof. So sleek:I bought this after I had my S5 stolen. I initially did not know how to feel because I liked having a battery I could myself replace. After a while, it has been great and my phone is so sleek and doesnt scratch at all. I can vouch it is waterproof. I highly recommend it.:2016-04-05:rajad
Samsung Galaxy S7:Well worth the wait......:Totally well worth the wait; once I saw the phone in person in stores, I knew this was the phone for me:2016-04-05:sarastar
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love this phone, bought just a week ago and have not been dissappointed, great apps, high clarity of the screen, awesome camera. Love it!:Excellent quality, clarity of screen, ease of use, awesome camera:2016-04-05:grammyed
Samsung Galaxy S7:New phone!!!!:Wonderful phone and highly recommend it!!! Would like more available info for ease of use.:2016-04-05:Brian and Tami
Samsung Galaxy S7:So much better than S4:Very easy to transfer all my old stuff to new phone love it!! So much better pictures and battery last longer ,charges so fast !!:2016-04-04:S7 all the way
Samsung Galaxy S7:Fast charge, great performance:"Have been nothing but pleased with this phone. Great performance, quick charge, and nice display. The only negative is that it is frustratingly easy to hit the ""back"" and ""program switch"" buttons when touching the screen, as well as tapping on the screen edge while holding the phone. However, I give it a pass because the reason for this is that the screen size is maximized for the unit.":2016-04-04:WheelOfTheLaw
Samsung Galaxy S7:Best Phone I've Owned:"Premium build. Excellent screen. Great camera. My only complaint about the phone is a software one: the screen overlay locks out the ability to change permissions while they're on. Just a small annoyance though during the first few weeks of using the phone.":2016-04-04:Bastions
Samsung Galaxy S7:I am a very happy boy.:I upgraded from the S5 and the difference is huge. I had already expected an excellant phone, and I got just that. The two things that really stand out are battery life and overall speed.:2016-04-04:shb224
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone:We just purchased these phones with my husband and we love it. It was a great purchase and love how it takes pictures the quality is the BEST!!:2016-04-04:kellym1985
Samsung Galaxy S7:I LOVE MY SAMSUNG:I love this phone after being a Apple user for over 10 years. I switched! I am glad i did this phone is Amazing and Verzion's service is Amazing:2016-04-04:DeAnna0810
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it:I have had quite a few phones from the m8 m9 g2 g3 I phones 3,4,5c,6,6s and alot of others but this s7 is probably my favorite. The battery life could be better but I love that it comes with a fast charger:2016-04-04:Fiascoscd
Samsung Galaxy S7:Fast UI and great screen:Best phone on the market for 2016!:2016-04-04:Thanigatyrone
Samsung Galaxy S7:The S7 is an awesome phone.:I've had this phone for a little over 2 weeks. It has not disappointed at all. It is the perfect size, charges quickly and has great battery life (much better than my S5 by comparison). It is fast and has lots of room for apps. I debated between this model and the Edge and I made the right decision for me.:2016-04-04:fridayschild25
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great all around phone:Bought this phone a week ago after I dropped the S5 I've had for two years in soup. I love the phone so far and all the new features they've added since the 5. The only thing I don't like so far is I had to use Ultra power saving mode yesterday and the message app kept glitching out and blacking out the screen & my brothers s7 did the same thing today:2016-04-03:Sharroun552
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love This Phone!:I bought this phone when it became avaliable for pre-order and I have absolutely love it. I believe the Samsung Galaxy Series is the best Android phone out there. I love that they listened to the public and bought back the SD card slot with the ability to have up to 200GB of additional space. I am also amazed with the camera especially since they went down in pixels from the S6. The speed of the phone is excellent as is the battery life and the ability for the phone to keep cool to the touch with new cooling core they used. I especially love that they were able to do all this while keeping the cool sleek design of the S6. I definitely recommend this phone A+ all the way.:2016-04-03:VB2016
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great price for a quality product.:I bought one for myself and my teenage daughter. She absolutely loves her phone. The camera is the best feature. It takes absolutely gorgeous pictures.:2016-04-03:Black Beauty 225
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features:I love the camera. WOULDN'T BE WITHOUT THE S7.:2016-04-03:Grandma Mermaid
Samsung Galaxy S7:This is truly an upgrade:"I have had Samsung before and was talked into the LG....UGH, now back to Samsung and loving the 7.....crisp, clear sound, fast, good battery, just so happy :)":2016-04-02:Bettyborne
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone !!!!:Upgraded from a 3 year old Samsung Galaxy S4. Much better battery life even when the S4 was new. Faster. Better features.:2016-04-02:TheChief44
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone....LOVE IT:I have had this phone a little over 3 weeks, I bought it as an upgrade from the Galaxy S4 mini and wasn't certain how I would like a big phone.......LOVE IT!!!!!!:2016-04-01:Jimmy1121
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone:I upgraded from the Samsung S5 to the S7 and i am so happy with it. the screen is pretty compariable to the S5 but the camera is much better. i love it. i bought the gold and it such a cool looking phone!:2016-04-01:mdee
Samsung Galaxy S7:WOW !!!!!:As usual Samsung has knocked it out of the park!This is the best phone I've ever had.I had a S3 and this is light years better.Hail the S7!!!:2016-04-01:Sbear 0929
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone!:Everything works great so far. Camera is awesome. I especially love the color and the design. Mine is a gold one.:2016-04-01:cm1111
Samsung Galaxy S7:I love it. From s4 to s7.:I love this phone. Camera is amazing.:2016-04-01:Chris6882
Samsung Galaxy S7:Best phone I've ever owned:The S7 is the fastest, most useful phone I've ever owned. Interface is easy to organize and use. The quality of the screen, camera, and sound are amazing. I hope to be using this phone for many years!:2016-04-01:ADK79
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone!!!!:Upgraded from the S5 it was fast and easy to transfer all my data. the Camera take very nice pictures and video. Battery life is not that bad, I would say better than most smart phones.:2016-03-31:Roll87
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone:I bought this phone a week ago and have enjoyed it the whole time. I have enjoyed the S5, S6, and S7 now. The battery will last all day with Web surfing, phone calls and gaming. Charges quickly as well. After the day at work I have a 35 minute drive. Charging it on the way home puts it at 100% by the end of the drive while still leaving the phone on. New features on this phone from the S6 that I am enjoying are video chat with my girlfriend who also has an S7. The pictures are just magnificent. Even the pics from the front camera are crystal clear. Just all around happy with the phone.:2016-03-31:Ajonesy22
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it!:"I bought this phone 3 weeks ago and so far I have no complaints. The battery life is great. I charge it at night and use it often during the day. By 11:00 I still have 43% battery and plug it back in for the next day!":2016-03-31:elmacl
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:Could not be happier with the s7 it does everything better and faster and easier. Best out there:2016-03-31:mark63055
Samsung Galaxy S7:I love this phone! Easy, fast and quick transition.:"I had the Galaxy 5 before, so switching to the new Galaxy S7 was simply an upgrade for me. It is SUCH an improvement over my old phone, which I liked a lot! The camera is stunning, the phone is quick, and I've been using it for about two weeks now and have never had to ""recharge"" the battery before the end of the day, unlike all the phones I had previously.":2016-03-31:redhair91
Samsung Galaxy S7:Everything I thought it would be.:I have been very pleased with it. The battery lasts good and charges so quickly.:2016-03-31:Ed10
Samsung Galaxy S7:New Phone:Easiest transition to a new phone ever. I love my new phone.:2016-03-31:flogo
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's early, but...:I got this phone the day it came out. I am a Samsung fan. first off, the camera is amazing. My son recwntly got his temps and he was driving down the road and I sneezes a pic of him. The houses in the background are crystal clear going 40mph. Also the slow motion video has sound. Function and ease of use are like other galaxy phones. Only knock I have is that I was hoping the bartery would last longer. It is good, but not great.:2016-03-31:Tim b
Samsung Galaxy S7:Never thought I'd like it better than my iPhone:I've had iPhones for the last 5 years, I NEVER thought I'd like anything else! Even the older galaxy's, I wasn't a fan of. I have another phone line, and it needed a phone on it, so I decided to try this one! And I LOVE it! So much so, that I've decided to switch the galaxy s7, to my main line, and use my iPhone 6s Plus, on my other. The battery definitely doesn't last near as long as advertised, but it does charge SUPER fast. I let both my iPhone and the Galaxy get to the same battery percentage, hooked them both up, and the Galaxy charged almost twice as fast. The pictures are incredible, crisp and clear, even when my 2 year old is moving around, dancing, being silly, it captures that moment without it being blurry! And I LOVE that you can add more storage just with an SD card! I take tons and tons of pictures(I have almost 9,000 on my iPhone) so it's a big deal for me! And even though the screen is substantially smaller than my iPhone, it's still amazing! I also love the keyboard, when you click on symbols, even when you press space, it doesn't go back to letters, which is something I've always hated with the iPhone. I don't think I'll switch my main line back to the iPhone!:2016-03-31:Shaerae91
Samsung Galaxy S7:Best phone I have ever had!:I pre-ordered the S7. And I have never been happier since I got it:2016-03-31:Nisus
Samsung Galaxy S7:Gloves do not fit this good!:Went from an S3 to the S7 excellent choice for me:2016-03-31:mycole
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung nailed it this time!:Had the phone 2 weeks now and it works great. Battery lasts almost 2 days on a charge. WiFi connects great and the speed of fingerprint recognition is amazing. Going back to the micro SD slot was a fantastic response by Samsung to customer feedback. The waterproof capability is a real comfort though I hope never.to need it. Now if Samsung will adopt the shatterproof screen... The camera is amazing. Overall 5 stars. Congrats Samsung. Job well done.:2016-03-31:Snakeman81
Samsung Galaxy S7:Best phone I've owned yet!:Verizon has always been the best of phone companies out of all of them out there. I upgraded from the s5 to the s7 and it was a very easy transaction and the phone is amazing! Awesome core processor and the amazing camera quality are just of the few next generation phone qualities that has started with the s7 and is still to come!:2016-03-30:evanscfa18
Samsung Galaxy S7:From Windows to Android:I bought this phone to assure compatibility with my G2 smart watch. Although it has only been just a couple of weeks, I am glad I did. The watch and phone are seamless in functioning together. Both are extremely intuitive, and the G2 is simply awesome. It does everything flawlessly. I am not a power user when it comes to games, so I have not feedback on down loading various apps. Both used for business and personal communications. No complaints so far.:2016-03-30:John0618
Samsung Galaxy S7:Enjoying It:I've had my Galaxy S7 (I only get the odd number Galaxy devices) since the day it was made available on American markets and am thoroughly enjoying it. I like the heavier, more solid feel to it. However, with the device enveloped in glass, I was afraid I would drop it and break it for about 8 days until I got an Otter Box. Fast, fluid movement. Clear, bright display. Camera is what I'd hoped it would be. Battery life, however is a major disappointment. Thankfully, the fast charging cord is pretty impressive. Moving my apps from device storage to SD storage is a little bit more laborious, but I'm glad that it is still an option. S Voice is much more responsive. I'm finding it very useful. I only want my contacts automatically saved to Verizon Cloud, nothing else. I'm frustrated that I can not find that option. The ear buds are ridiculous. They are awkward shaped, don't fit, don't stay in and are uncomfortable. Great sound if you can make them stay in.:2016-03-30:Sky_Mex
Samsung Galaxy S7:Amazing Phone so Far:Camera is great. Screen and the visuals are amazing. Touchwiz is better. Phone is very responsive. Fingerprint scanner works well. Have 4 fingers programed in which is the max amount. I had the Galaxy 3 so this is a huge bump up in everything possible. Samsung continues to do a great job improving their phones. Huge plus is the Micro SD slot back. I got the 128GB to hold all my music, pictures, and you can put your apps on it as well if you want. Only been almost 3 weeks having it and I have no complaints. Only exception would be the battery life seems to drain if you're on it with hard use. Usually go to sleep with about 90% battery and not charging it throughout the day I get to about 25%. So not terrible and that's with moderate usage in spurts. Started my day today at 84% at 6AM and its now almost 5pm and I am at 15% and that was again with moderate usage. Wi-Fi Turned off, Bluetooth turned off and Location turned off as well.  All in all top of the line phone and so happy I got this. Just waiting on my Gear S2 since I pre-ordered the phone.:2016-03-30:Buddy1320
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesome, Awesome:I've had it for over a week now. Great low light pictures, battery lasts over 2 days if you can put it down, lasted for over a day when I first got it and had it on all the time while I was setting it up (easy to do) and getting used to it. So many great features!:2016-03-30:Steve11flhtc
Samsung Galaxy S7:From s4 to s7:I love this phone. I am not a phone fanatic but the easy of the Samsung Galaxy just works for me. I like the s7 because it has more memory. Camera is excellent.:2016-03-30:LindaLLW
Samsung Galaxy S7:Cool Phone, love the voice messaging and the expanded memory:I bought this phone a few days ago and it works great. Have an S4 and S5. Have not have any issues so far.:2016-03-30:wdc59
Samsung Galaxy S7:Wonderful Phone:I bought this phone after finding it the most familiar when comparing to the big three flagships right now. 6P,LG5,G7. Loving it. Brilliant screen responsive and incredibly tactile almost too much. Battery life is great if you do the defaults (turn down brightness etc) great phone right out of the box would reccomend:2016-03-30:Iamthemurray
Samsung Galaxy S7:What I've been waiting for:Had the Galaxy 5 and loved it but the 16 gigs of internal storage was becoming annoying. Waited for the S7 and very glad I did. 32 is always better than 16, even with the SD card. It is fast and the display is gorgeous. Love the always-on feature especially since I use it as a bedside clock. No need to wake it up to tell me the time. I got the gold case and it is beautiful. Having read reviews I immediately added a glass screen protector and a clear case that keeps the beauty of the phone. Haven't taken many photos yet but the few I have are very good.:2016-03-30:JKAZ
Samsung Galaxy S7:New to the S Family:I purchase the S7 as an upgrade from my Note 3. I thought I was going to miss the huge Note screen and the S pen but the fact I can add extra storage is the best thing ever. I now use the Message app instead of the text message that's standard and I love the VW Message app. But all in all I don't really miss the Note or the S Pen. The phone is fun and sleek. I have not tried the water test, as I tend not put my phone in water but if my hands are wet I am not worried if I need to answer a call. I do miss the feature that allows me to wave my hand over the phone and answer the call but that's just one feature.:2016-03-30:ZapJ
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it:I upgraded from the S5 about two weeks. And have had a great experience up to this point. Love the camera. I think the battery life is great. Love everything about it. No problems yet:2016-03-30:11345
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great,phone works AWESOME:I brought this phone about 3 weeks ago, I am so happy I did!!! I had the Samsung Galaxy 5 but this S7 is so much better!!!!! Even the Camera is so much better. Thank you Samsung for coming out with such an awesome phone!!!!!:2016-03-30:mdunn
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy 5 to Galaxy 7:I am very satisfied with this upgrade, it has performed well in all aspects but the battery life. This could use improvement, it gets me through the day with a fair amount of usage but heavy use could leave me with a paper weight!:2016-03-30:Bill549
Samsung Galaxy S7:great phone:i am happy so buy it:2016-03-30:rajendrard
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great new phone:I upgraded from the S5 and the difference, especially in the camera area, is significant and great. The S5 camera was very disappointing. This one is outstanding. I'm an amateur photographer, using a Canon 70D so used to good photos and I'm very happy with this phone's capability.:2016-03-30:Elfinhav
Samsung Galaxy S7:Upgraded from a S3 to S7:I have had the S7 for three weeks now and absolutely glad I upgraded from the S3. It took some setting up however it was worth the time. This model is light and slim. I went with the wireless charger and have had no problems with it. There are so many ways to set up your phone, you may get confused at first however settings are easy to change. The only complaint is the battery life is not long and you have to make sure the background light is turned down to preserve the battery life and applications are not running all the time. The battery will last all day for the most part.:2016-03-30:Cld022
Samsung Galaxy S7:Amazing!:TOTALLY AWESOME! GREAT FEATURES! FAST CHARGING! SLIM! TAKES AWESOME PICTURES EVEN IN LOW LIGHTING! SAMSUNG FAN FOR LIFE!!!!:2016-03-30:Jones1987
Samsung Galaxy S7:love the apps and features:I love the multiple windows and use the s health everyday and the google play this is the best phone. So glad I purchased it.:2016-03-30:mc50
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's pretty great.:Love the phone. It's pretty fast, has a great display, expandable memory and so on.:2016-03-30:Jay71806
Samsung Galaxy S7:Transition to Smart Phone So Far So Good:So far I have enjoyed the transition to a smart phone with the Galaxy S7 which with the Easy Mode has made it much easier. I still have a way to go but each step so far has been rewarding and very helpful in everyday life.:2016-03-30:Grinder Man
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good features. Easy to use:I have one big problem with my phone. If you have the blue tooth and the WIFI on at the same time you cannot access the internet. I am waiting for Samsung to fix the problem.:2016-03-30:Lori T
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone - amazing camera!:Samsung Galaxy S7 rocks. Has everything you could possibly need, and more. Fast charging, vivid screen, amazing camera, great features.:2016-03-30:kkoby
Samsung Galaxy S7:Super easy to use and switch.:Great response. Went from s6 to this s7. And I am highly impressed.:2016-03-30:Myonedragon
Samsung Galaxy S7:LOVE THIS PHONE:I recently upgraded from a Galaxy S5. The change is uncanny. Better everything. Wireless charging, water resistant, better camera, more features, larger storage......I highly recommend picking one up. Still thin and manageable.:2016-03-30:Byner
Samsung Galaxy S7:All around great phone:Very cool features camera , storage expandable:2016-03-30:Gggl
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:"I've had the phone for a month now and simply love it. No problems, no issues....period! Simply a very good phone! :-)":2016-03-30:Veno55
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone - watch for button issue early on.:Great phone so far. Love the features and the battery life. Only issue was having to replace the phone within a few days of purchase due to the power and down volume buttons that stopped working. Same issue with the replacement a few days later. I Googled the problem and found it was a known issue that a re-boot would remedy. Probably need to get that information out to the stores. Also just received an update, maybe the fix is there.:2016-03-30:LVRed777
Samsung Galaxy S7:The best phone on the market... Period.:I LOVE THIS PHONE! It is a perfect blend of the s5 and s6 with loads of refinement. Battery is improved, ergonomics improved, camera improved, RAM management improved.  I cannot recommend this enough. If you are considering an Android this should be the top of your list.:2016-03-29:Photon155
Samsung Galaxy S7:Smooth move from S4:"Very happy with the Galaxy S7. Screen is great -- I can even play hidden object games on it! Camera is fast and handles low-light well, as promised. Battery life adequate. (I wish I had known that the Edge version has a larger battery; that might have made me upgrade to that.) I haven't tested out its water resistance, nor the SD Card option, but I am glad those features are there. I really appreciated the smooth upgrade from the S4: I had the Verizon folks do the move for me, and everything moved: logons to WiFi hotspots, text message exchanges, etc. (OK, a couple of games reset back to level 1. I can deal with that.) Best of all, of course, is that I now have room for ALL my apps in main memory!":2016-03-29:AskThatNiceMan
Samsung Galaxy S7:wonderful:Great battery life, wonderful camera, quick to charge, long battery life. Only wish that sound notifications of text messages, etc could be heard while on the phone.:2016-03-29:JTCh
Samsung Galaxy S7:really like this phone:I upgraded from s4 to s7,and so very pleased. No huge change from the layout so was easy to transition, but the features are so much more appreciated. Battery is great for me; all I do is adjust settings when I'm not using draining features, and set it back when I am. I've had plenty of battery life. Love this phone.:2016-03-29:tk9nacho
Samsung Galaxy S7:It just works. And the network is superb:Had 2 weeks. Works great. Fast. No issues.:2016-03-29:Marcus w
Samsung Galaxy S7:Weeks later, Love it!:I am coming from a HTC One m8 with previous experience with Samsung smartphones. There are few things that I dislike. The camera is great, the battery life is great, and the speed is great. The one thing that could be improved in my opinion is the fingerprint reader. I have trouble with it reading my thumb and often have to place my finger on the home button multiple times.:2016-03-29:Lincoln50
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love my new phone!:"I love my new Galaxy S7. I really like the fact that you can now add more memory to the phone. It has great picture quality and the battery lasts longer. I love the ""always on"" feature that allows you to view the date and time without waking up the phone.":2016-03-29:Peggy72
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very Pleased With the S7:I prepurchased this phone and have had it a couple of weeks now. Very pleased with it. I like the size, features, and ease of use. I previously owned the S5 and was happy with this but when this latest version came out I knew it was time for me to upgrade. Glad I did!:2016-03-29:RGBEN1953
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great on features. Easy to learn. Just about dummy proof.:Bought the phone for my wife, and she loves it. Cant get her off Facebook. She's starting to be more and more tech savvy each day. But word to the wise if you are not tech savvy, you need to set the phone to only link to the internet with Wi-Fi. Be sure you set your plan for your data usage. My bride used nearly 56 gigs of hers in 2 hour's playing with the phone, learning the phone. She thought she was on Wi-Fi and was not. Just saying be careful until you become tech savvy.:2016-03-29:mike4329860
Samsung Galaxy S7:the best phone I've used:excellent camera, wireless charging, design, and etc.:2016-03-29:first time sam phone user
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Android Upgrade:The Samsung S-7 is an excellent upgrade for my Motorola Maxx. It has the latest Android OS and the data transfer was easy. I no longer have to wait for Motorola to deliver promised upgrades. I think that Samsung support will be better.:2016-03-29:ArrowheadDave
Samsung Galaxy S7:You can't beat this phone!:Best phone I have ever owned. This phone is my best friend. I know that sounds pretty pathetic. But I am proud to say that my phone, this phone, is my best friend. I don't care what people think!..... It is a really good phone though.:2016-03-29:Bothofus
Samsung Galaxy S7:This phone is the future:The S7 is by far the best smartphone I have ever used:2016-03-29:KOTU2054
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone:This phone is the best in a long line of Samsung phones I have owned. Camera is great and other features make it the best.:2016-03-29:HBjr
Samsung Galaxy S7:Much Better than my old Windows phone:Very happy with the features of my new phone. I use two e-mails, one for work one for personal and I can easily go from one to the other with this phone. Too bad Hillary didn't try it. The display is excellent and the optional lighting is great, get miraines and it's so nice to be able to lower the light. I found this phone easy to set up. The con would be that it uses so much more data.:2016-03-29:GrandmaSue10
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love this phone! Very fast!:Have had the phone a few weeks now and absolutely no complaints at this point. The processor is very fast, no hesitation in any of the apps. Picture quality is unbelievable. The size is acceptable, no issues carrying it in shirt pocket or where ever. I can go on about everything I like about it, but the best thing to do is try it out yourself.:2016-03-29:Sunny229
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone:I went from the S4 to this and I am glad I did. Battery is great and charges fast. using apps it does draw more, but talking and texting it is very good. Photos are great, I expanded the SD card to 64GB so the phone now has like 90GB! Video calling is cool, but only those who have it, and it does use your data. Overall it is a great phone, Love Androids.:2016-03-29:
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use:Had for a few weeks, battery life is good camera is better than the s5 which was my previous phone. This phone is fantastic.:2016-03-29:Davis9384
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone and Great Battery:The phone works great. The response time is very fast. Can go between apps quickly and smoothly. The Battery life is great. Left phone uncharged for 36 hours and still had %38 battery left.:2016-03-29:Mwhite75
Samsung Galaxy S7:I think I made a great trade:I have been using it for about three weeks, and I am very impressed with the phone. The camera is way better than the turbo.Call quality is very good, GPS navigation is great. I really like it better than the turbo I had.:2016-03-29:Millen Ohio
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7 best yet!!:Got the s7 the day it released and couldn't be happier unless they made it with a removable battery. But having SD slot back was big for me:2016-03-29:Ryan313
Samsung Galaxy S7:Only minor gripes:I only really have two minor gripes with the phone to this point. The first is that it can sometimes be a little too sensitive and opens links when I am merely scrolling through. The other is the placement of the speaker on the bottom right. The way I hold my phone, especially when playing games (three fingers behind, cradling on my pinky) blocks the speaker and I cannot hear the sound.  Big picture, those are very small issues and this phone is an excellent step up from my previous phone (HTC One M8):2016-03-29:BoomerGVL
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it so far!:I used to have a Galaxy s5 from US Cellular. And while I loved the phone, I really hated the service. My mom has been with Verizon for years and hasn't had too many problems with them. So I decided to switch to Verizon after they released the Galaxy s7. It has the features of the s6 that I loved, only better designed. And it has expandable memory, which was the main reason I didn't upgrade to the s6 when it came out. I like to have a lot of music on my phones, and take a lot/save a lot of pictures. And sometimes the internal storage isn't enough for that. So bringing back this feature made me very happy. Not to mention, it's a gorgeous phone! Samsung's have always been some of my favorite phones. Never had any problems with them. This phone has a BEAUTIFUL display, good battery life, amazing features and cosmetics to the phone-loving my gold platinum!, and it has an AMAZING camera. Takes beautiful shots and video. The auto focus and blurring of the background has to be my favorite about the camera. I am not disappointed at all with this phone or my service. Thanks Verizon!:2016-03-29:CheyNicole
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's great:The phone features are easy and camera quality is awesome. The battery lasts for the entire day.:2016-03-29:Jdamico88
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition from S3:Not much of a learning curve from S3. Fast charging.:2016-03-29:JOHN 64
Samsung Galaxy S7:excellent phone:Upgraded from Samsung S4 mini. Loved that phone and this is better. Easy to upgrade and all info backed up to phone seamlessly. Very fast processor and long battery life. Some items need to be relearned but would recommend this phone:2016-03-29:toothjockey
Samsung Galaxy S7:The best phone available:"I've had the S7 for a couple weeks now and everything has worked great. I upgraded from the S4, which i had for over 2 years and was still working fine, but I wanted the S7 for the new faster camera and a longer lasting battery.  Pros: -Camera speed is super fast and crisp, and by double tapping the main button it opens immediately(great feature). -The fast-charging feature is amazing, my phone is usually fully charged before I can fall asleep at night. -battery life - I use my phone frequently and have yet to go below 50% after a full day of use. -Removeable SD storage is back, so you can increase your phones capacity. -Customization of your home screen with widgets/contacts/etc.  Cons: Size - I would have liked for the S7 to be the same size as the S7 edge. I wasn't sold on the edge feature and worried i'd end up with a cracked screen.":2016-03-29:Mrbiscuits
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesome phone easy to transfer pictures from any phone!!:I bought this phone a few weeks ago and love it!! Was easy to transfer things from even my old iPhone onto here plus the expanded memory! It works smoothly and I love the camera highly recommend this phone only thing I would like is for it to have the removable battery again bUT that's not that big of a deal.:2016-03-29:Bluetopaz87
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good improvements:upgraded form a galaxy S3, and find they have made many great improvements.:2016-03-29:am33669
Samsung Galaxy S7:My Samsung Galaxy S7:I purchased this phone from Costco Phone Ctn., and it is the best cell phone I ever owned:2016-03-29:Vance44
Samsung Galaxy S7:I love this phone.:So far I loved it. Has enough memory with extra for everything I have on my phone. The battery is better than the S5. The camera is better, love that. Much faster!:2016-03-29:CPoston
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very happy w/ my Galaxy S7! Regardless of...:I am very happy with the expanded storage. A little disappointed that we have to use a different charger from the Samsung Galaxy S5. I love that it is waterproof! Especially since my 3 yrs old is very sneaky and fast. He has already taken it to the bath tub 3 times. I do everything with my phone, from personal use, to work, etc. So I am enjoying it very much. The design is a lot more sleek, but it's hard to use parts of the screen if you get one of those glass screen protectors. They don't cover the screen completely and if you put it in an otter box defender case it's even harder to use. The battery life could last longer, right now I get maybe 18 hrs out of it, and I am a light user. My old phone would last about 2 days. I thought about getting a new Apple phone, but I am glad I didn't since they don't offer expanded memory slots! Plus, the Galaxy phones are a lot easier to use!:2016-03-29:TjEng29
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's a Galaxy!:Best galaxy so far! Have own the original galaxy s the s4 and now the s7. All great phones! They have their moments over load of memory and battery consumption... but overall with a larger sd and rechargeable case just makes owning a galaxy that much more worth it.:2016-03-29:Le Moiyet
Samsung Galaxy S7:Loving it!:So far, so good. I haven't had any problems. My calls are crystal clear, photos are excellent, it is fast, and has been holding a charge pretty well.:2016-03-29:Chatty Kathy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it!!!!!:I love the functionality of the phone. I just wish it was a little bigger!:2016-03-29:Dtnoh1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Best phone I've ever had:I left android phones years ago because they were getting terrible. I went to an iPhone 4 and loved it. Recently my iPhone 5S broke, and I decided to check out the Samsung phones. I decided to get the new S7 and am blown away. It's smoother, faster, and takes better pictures than my iPhones did. The technology blows iPhones away. I won't go back to Apple.:2016-03-29:Coastiekyle
Samsung Galaxy S7:Fabulous Phone:The Samsung S7 is far superior to my previous phone. Sound quality, touch control, available apps, etc., are all much better. The quality of this phone exceeds any other phone I've had. There are many more features included or that can be added. The battery life is much longer, easier to use, and the camera is fantastic. I love it!:2016-03-29:Bill 0451
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features awesome camera and fast to go from different apps:The phone is definitely an upgrade from the 5. The only bad is the keyboard texting, writing emails, and general use, the keyboard seems to act like an iPhone the outside keys do not seem to respond to accurate screen to finger positions,a lot of miss letters and other navigation problems:2016-03-29:Dooogie56
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung has nailed it - again:I love the Galaxy phones and will only EVER buy them. This is a great product - ease of use, smooth transition, speed, sleek design. The camera pictures are amazing. Always impressive!:2016-03-29:mrscwats
Samsung Galaxy S7:Best Samsung Hands down:Just purchased it and I'm glad I did.:2016-03-29:synch
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great feature:I got this phone a month ago and love it:2016-03-29:Miner12
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it!!!!!:I have had this phone for about 2 weeks and I absolutely love it. It's fast, the battery time lasts and the camera and other features are amazing.:2016-03-29:Happy Customer
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love this phone... was an easy transition from my S4 to the S7.:I upgraded from an S4 about 3 weeks ago and have had no problems. Great phone, takes awesome pictures.:2016-03-29:krmckinn
Samsung Galaxy S7:Fast and easy:I have had it for a month and I love it, avid galaxy fan,had them all and this by far is the best. Fantastic camera and sound quality is perfect. Luv it:2016-03-29:Barbara 54
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very nice:Phone is extremely nice and have not had any trouble with it works great:2016-03-29:Jkyle78
Samsung Galaxy S7:S5 to S7:Coming from the S5 I see significant improvements, better display/camera quality, faster, lighter, better looking, and just overall an improvement. I skipped over the S6 because the two things I loved about the S5 were absent on the S6, but the S7 makes up for that by incorporating the expandable storage and water resistance, and considering it already starts as 32gb, my additional 32gb card is more than enough storage. ( I didn't have a sd card in my S5 until the begining of this year) Overall it's just a good phone, it does get warm to the touch when charging sometimes, but thus far I don't have any negatives to say about the phone, other than no tempered glass screen protectors yet( that account for the curve of the phone non edge model), but those should be rolling out early April, so nearly there. Set up was easy, customization easier as there's a theme option, unsure if that's on the S6 but it's a cool feature for sure, and unexpected, as I love to mod/customize my phones.:2016-03-29:Namii
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:Went from Galaxy S4 to S7. Phone is great, works perfectly. No complaints:2016-03-29:fairytopia305
Samsung Galaxy S7:best Galaxy yet:No problems so far. Battery isnt any better than the S5 i had before. I was hoping for better battery life.:2016-03-29:Toferb
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone!:Nice phone, went from S4 mini to the S7. What a difference, the camera is great, the fast charging is convenient. Did not take long to set it up to my liking. So for so good. Very happy with my new Samsung galaxy S7.:2016-03-29:Robert7172
Samsung Galaxy S7:The best Samsung to date!:After some early aggravation regarding wifi and Bluetooth which they fixed with recent update, I am completely satisfied with the phone. Good speed and excellent pictures.:2016-03-29:Lou12345
Samsung Galaxy S7:Super, Sleek, Simple:I've had my Galaxy S7 for a few weeks and I am so glad I made the switch to Samsung. This phone was so easy to set up and transfer all my apps, etc. The battery lasts for almost 2 days with just regular use. It lasts 1 day if I'm playing lots of games. I haven't tested the water resistantance but I've handled it with damp hands (answered the phone while doing dishes) and it worked.:2016-03-29:Firefly0414
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Transition from my old phone.:I bought this phone in February and received it a couple of weeks ago. It is a very good phone. I love it. It is a lot better then my old samsung galaxy 5. Would highly recommend it.:2016-03-29:Steven Cutting
Samsung Galaxy S7:Best phone I've owned:Excellent features and very easy to use. The VR is amazing and all of the apps work very well. Highly recommend.:2016-03-29:Nicholas416
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone and features I LOVE IT!:This is for my first upgrade to a new new phone and I have to say I LOVE THE NEW SAMSUNG S7! It is super easy to use and the features and apps are great! My battery last for hours and the wireless charger is super fast:2016-03-29:Lomecia1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it!:I just love it, it's a great addition to the Galaxy S family:2016-03-29:Luciano09
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it!:I have had this phone for about 2 weeks. I love it. I upgraded from the S4 so there are a lot of changes with this phone. A lot better camera with better picture quality and cool features. I LOVE that I can unlock the phone just with my thumb print in 1 second- no more entering a password! Only improvement would be to have an even longer battery life but considering that I had to charge my s4 3x a day, and I only have to charge this 1x a day, it is an improvement.:2016-03-29:sd06
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to Use!:Although I loved my Galaxy S5, I'm very glad I got the Galaxy S7. Nothing to complain about with this one!:2016-03-29:SYP5
Samsung Galaxy S7:LOVE LOVE LOVE this phone!!!:I needed to upgrade my Samsung Galaxy S4 antique, so when it started having issues with the keyboard, I knew it was time. I heard such great things about the S7, so I knew I would be getting a great product. I was like a kid at Christmas waiting for the arrival of my new phone. It was also a breeze to transfer all the data from my S4 to my S7 using the cloud service. I have only had the new phone for about 2 weeks now, and it is already so much better! There are so many improved features and I have only had it for a short time, so I am certain I will love it more the longer I have it. My Samsung Galaxy S4 was a great product and I was very happy with it. In fact, the only reason I did an upgrade was because it started to have serious issues. However, I am happy it did as I truly LOVE my new Galaxy S7!!! I cannot say enough about this product!:2016-03-29:Clover77
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it!:I am a new user to Samsung (I am coming from an iPhone.) Very easy to use and learn. Set up was very easy. Picture quality and resolution is amazing. Seems like battery drains fairly quickly though.:2016-03-29:tycass
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone:I love this phone, it's fast and great. Also, what you hear about the phone being water proof is true and it resists scratches. The only downfall is their is no remote control on this model, but if that doesn't bother you then it's a great phone.:2016-03-29:Brian027
Samsung Galaxy S7:My wife and I love this new phone:"We just upgraded from a ""dumb"" phone last week. We can't believe the clarity and functionality of this new phone. I also have a iPhone 5 provided by my work. I love this S7 better than the iPhone 5.":2016-03-29:Paul from KY
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very fast and responsive.:I just made my purchase of the Samsung Galaxy S7 and I could not be happier. It is very easy to use, fast and looks great with all kinds of great features.:2016-03-29:Slatedaddy
Samsung Galaxy S7:One little problem:I love the phone but did have a problem last night. I was texting and all of a sudden the screen went black. I could not get the phone to work or restart. I had to go on to the Internet and found out how to restart by holding the right button and the down volume at the same time. The person at the Verizon store should have told me about this possibly happening.:2016-03-29:Steppy67
Samsung Galaxy S7:A solid work of art:Upgrading from a S5 Active on a different carrier, to the S7 was amazing! I love the wireless charging, which even works with a Speck candyshell case.:2016-03-29:mike0890
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy Change Over:I've had this for about a week now. So far the learning curve has been smooth from the change over from a Droid Mini. I love all the new features the Galaxy has and the camera is the best part:2016-03-29:Coppsj02
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone:I moved from an LGG2 to the Galaxy S7. The G2 was getting tired and needed to be replaced. Verizon made it easy for me to get the latest and greatest Galaxy.:2016-03-29:rickkaz1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:Upgraded from S5 so is very similar, but runs much faster. Not completely satisfied with the battery life, no better than the S5 but had higher expectations after reading reviews - too bad it can't be replaced like the S5 battery. There are a few quirks that haven't been resolved, but it may be the upgrade to the OS that's the problem rather than the phone (won't display text & email previews in notification bar). Has more memory plus has expandable via SD card so I now have space, but would have been nice if it was offered in 64. Camera is better than the S5 - clarity and takes pics faster.:2016-03-29:JoJoCrew
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone!:I got this phone to upgrade my Galaxy S5 and specifically avoided upgrading to the S6. The water and dust-proof are fantastic durability features that should be default in most phones now. The addition of the expandable storage sold me on this phone. My one issue is the software, specifically all of the added apps that cannot be uninstalled. While this is only a small issue, it is something I wish all carriers and manufacturers would address. I would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a new phone, whether this is their first smartphone, android phone, or mobile device. Getting a tight fitting case is simply required to avoid dropping the slippery, glass phone.:2016-03-29:WesleyR
Samsung Galaxy S7:great battery life:I have had my phone for just over 2 weeks and absolutely love it. After a brief 3 day hiccup due to my own ineptness, I am up and running again. I love the ease of use and the ability to customize settings and screens to reflect my unique lifestyle and personality. One suggestion would be to add more zen like tones to the sound options ;).:2016-03-29:la12PA
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone perfect size:I purchased this the week it came out. Absolutely love it!!!:2016-03-29:Gator50
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it!:Bought it from Costco and they set it up for me and have had no issues. Camera is excellent! Everything is working great! Battery life isn't as great as advertised but quick charge works fast!:2016-03-29:Shellys
Samsung Galaxy S7:Worth it:7 is awesome, really got this one right:2016-03-29:Fwfurey
Samsung Galaxy S7:Finally, Samsung! Finally!:"The best Android device I've ever used. Amazing camera, the bloatwares are almost gone, runs smoothly, and the battery longs almost two days.  Ergonomy is fine, premium finishing, the device is just gorgeous. Don't worry about ""Samsung Android"" version, the customizations are now limited to a minimum and really helpful features.  I've also bought a 64GB miniSD card, so now I can store up to 96 GB of files.  So far, so good.":2016-03-29:toadgeek
Samsung Galaxy S7:Big advancement for our phones:Brought the Galaxy S7 shortly after launch. These replaced our aging HTC DNAs. This was as you might expect a huge leap. Speed and quality are amazing. In our location the signal strength is nearly zero. We had a network extender for our old phones. THe network extender is listed as not compatible with the S7s, but appears to work. Check with Verizon if you have an old network extender to make sure.  Overall, the S7s have lived up to our expectations and will keep us on the Verizon network:2016-03-29:RichS7Galaxy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone. I consider it the best phone available.:Had a Galaxy 4. Would not purchase the 5 or 6 due to features. This phone has everything back that I was looking for. Only missing feature I would have liked to see is the 3.0 USB charging port. I would trade not replaceable battery for a water sealed phone any day. Especially one that has great battery life like the new S7 does. Great job with the minor adjustments of the screens and the camera features. I am still discovering some of the new features but I love this phone.:2016-03-29:Ivan 17
Samsung Galaxy S7:One incredible phone.:Best phone I have ever had. Like everything about it.:2016-03-29:Rex12
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love This Phone:I had a GS4 for 3 years because it was rock solid and I loved it. This phone is just as good only better and faster. I spent a little time personalizing and it's all mine. Thank you Samsung for doing it again with the GS7!:2016-03-29:Jeffalex
Samsung Galaxy S7:Back to glory days:"This phone is everything that was great about the S5 AND it has an even better water rating than the S5, and rekindles our love with expandable storage. Just be careful when you pull out the SIMcard holder to place your microSD, that lil sucker of a SIM will shoot across the room, lol. It's also everything great about the S6, with none of it's faults(like the lack of water resistance, slippery in hand, etc). It's slicker, sexier, sits well in the hand, and has higher QUALITY camera and a higher grade of Gorilla Glass than the S6. Side note: Mega pixels are not and SHOULD NOT ever be used as a marker for quality of camera. If you don't get this, or how aperture and shutter speed effect your photos, you don't get photography and should sit down before you hurt yourself.  Overall, I love this phone.":2016-03-29:whydoIneedauniquenickname
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the S7:I was hesitant to buy but am loving it. The fast charge makes it easy to stay fully charged.:2016-03-29:Carolefromkia
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung S 7:Love the phone!!! Easy use!!:2016-03-29:Toniii
Samsung Galaxy S7:just love it:This is my second Samsung, coming from an S5 super happy with the performance,battery and camera great job!:2016-03-29:billt818
Samsung Galaxy S7:WiFi issue is resolved!:I was on the last day of my trial period and had just called VZ support for assistance as I was having issues along with quite a few other S7 owners, I was about ready to try and return my phone for another and then a system update went through and has totally changed my perspective on keeping this phone! I had been turning off my data to give the WiFi connection a chance, I left it off after this update and tried out a few games I had previously been having issues with and they worked without any delays at all. I'm so very happy this issue has been taken care of, as this was the only real issue I was running into...now about this battery life...maybe with this update it will help the battery last just a bit longer as well.:2016-03-29:spesicka
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone!:Coming from the HTC one this is a nice upgrade. It's fast, hasn't freezed yet and takes nice photos. The overall size and design of the phone is great, also has neat features. The only thing is the screen randomly lights up throughout the day, I've turned the always on feature off. I'm not sure if it's a glitch or what. Also I hate how the tempered glass cover fits the screen because of the slightly curved edges but I've learned to ignore it. I have horses so the water and dust resistance is a huge bonus. Definitely glad I pre-ordered!:2016-03-27:Kay6
Samsung Galaxy S7:LOVE THIS PHONE:I love that its water proof and the cam is amazing. especially under water!:2016-03-27:phone wiz
Samsung Galaxy S7:Powerful phone that out beats it's previous models:I upgraded from my Galaxy S4, mostly because I wasn't happy with the S5/6 models due to absent SD card. Glad they brought it back, it's easy to put in/remove although you need a little tool to open the water resistant slot. The battery is true to the specs ~25 hours although it comes with many built in battery saving tools that can extend it longer. The camera is amazing and the low light functionality is finally up to par.:2016-03-24:Mike I
Samsung Galaxy S7:State of the Art... in your hand today.:After performing head to head against the best offerings from Apple, LG, and Motorola, the Galaxy S7 stands the tallest. I have had it for 2 weeks, and it is the nicest phone I've ever used, and it should be. Kudos to Samsung.:2016-03-24:Johnny Fever
Samsung Galaxy S7:Spectacular......:I've had the s7 for almost 2 weeks and couldn't be happier. New to Verizon & started with an iPhone 6 plus, but so glad I switched to this. Beautiful display, great camera, very easy to use. I've been streaming March Madness games regularly for hours and still have 30% battery at the end of the day. Call quality has been very good. I have poor cell reception inside my house (no matter what carrier), so Wi-Fi calling is a must and has worked seamlessly.:2016-03-23:boris56
Samsung Galaxy S7:love it so far:This is a great phone and overall I am very pleased with it. Transferring everything from my old phone to this one was much easier and painless than expected. The screen is very clear and vibrant. The camera is top notch. Battery life is comparable to my old s4 with an extended battery in it. I only have three small complaints so far. 1. This version of Android does not have a music player like my old one did. I downloaded one from the play store and problem solved. 2. The ear buds it comes with do not block out any background noise which makes it hard to use them in noisy areas. 3. Probably the biggest issue. Although the speaker on the phone is loud and clear, the one used for regular calls is not very loud at all.:2016-03-22:cjg80
Samsung Galaxy S7:Best phone I've ever owned:"I switched to Verizon from another carrier and bought the Samsung Galaxy S7 about a month ago. So far, I love it!  Pros: Fast! Good size, vivid colors, excellent sound, just enough space, SD card, waterproof, can do so many things! And I love the new Android Marshmallow interface. And the cameras... they take such beautiful pictures! The ""selfie"" camera is great because you can use hand motions to take a picture, which means steady, not blurry images that always turn out awesome. It feels great to hold and looks awesome. And the list goes on and on...  Cons: The battery life is not great, even after turning off the ""always on"" display. But, given how awesome everything else is, carrying around my charger to plug it in once or twice a day depending on use is not so bad. Plus, with the charger that comes with the phone, it only takes about an hour to fully charge... so really it's not so bad after all.":2016-03-21:Hedwig3927
Samsung Galaxy S7:Best Samsung yet:Coming from the Galaxy Note 2, which I liked quite a bit, this is a surprising step up. The s7 is faster, lighter, has better audio and video, better size and slightly better battery life. Fair warning, though, as a previous Android user, I found it pretty easy to navigate and customize. Someone coming from iOS or Windows Phone, or a smartphone newbie, might be a bit frustrated at first with getting everything set up the way they want. Also, nearly 10gb of the 32gb storage is taken up with system memory, but I have a 64gb microSD card, so no biggie for me. But overall, thumbs up !!:2016-03-21:milw nerd
Samsung Galaxy S7:Long Battery & Fast Charging:Loved that the step-by-step setup remembered my secured wifi from the previous phone. Picks up work wiifi with no lagging. Charging the phone for 20mins brings it up to 90%. Was worried about the picture taking. Much faster, clearer than previous phone! Cropping or magnifying a photo is so much better than previous phones. Love the fingerprint recognition to open the phone. Music streams beautifully. Not crazy about the preset ringtones, but that's easily fixed with an app.:2016-03-21:Baltimore Eve
Samsung Galaxy S7:The phone I've been waiting for:Best phone I have ever had. Has all the features anyone would want. Easy to use. I wouldn't change anything about this phone. All Pro's. No con's.:2016-03-20:thatswhatchuysez
Samsung Galaxy S7:Amazing best phone yet:I just got the phone the other day and I'm truly amazed on its performance, the battery isn't the best but the phone stands up for it, I've got the gold s7 and I love it, charges really fast, camera is really wonderful, performance is great, the new android marshmellow flaw free at this point, the only thing I don't like is thescreen protector and cases there isn't many cases for it yet but I have found some on ebay but Verizon don't have many yet, it's more of a sturdy phone than my s5 was, so far I can't really complain I recommend this phone to anyone who likes a fast phone, but I would get a good case for it and eBay is the only one that has em right now just make sure u select right one, but u won't be sorry with this purchase it's really a wonderful phone and u will love the camera, even its 12mp it's great have a good day:2016-03-20:Steve150
Samsung Galaxy S7:great:The phone is great the only issue i have is that i lose LTE service and goes to 3g a lot...i came from s5 and i never seen it go to 3g....but overall great phone and looks amazing:2016-03-18:Angel57r5tg
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone!:So far I love this phone. I upgraded from the S4 mini, and I'm so glad I did. The camera is absolutely amazing!! I've had no problem with the battery life, I've only had to charge at the end of the day so far. Gave the design a 4 because I know the battery isn't going to last forever, so without a removable battery, once the battery dies, a new phone will have to be bought. I only buy a new phone every two years or may even wait longer.:2016-03-18:kayjean
Samsung Galaxy S7:Best yet.:Samsung S series just keep improving with every new model. The S7 is a no brainer.:2016-03-17:ke1km
Samsung Galaxy S7:I love it:Best phone ever. Started with galaxy s4.. now this.. love it:2016-03-17:TheMiz45
Samsung Galaxy S7:Greatest Galaxy to Date:I have moved from the S3, to the S5, and now the S7. The S7 is by far the greatest Galaxy phone to date. All the features you love about the Galaxy series, AND they brought back the SD card. Moving my contacts took less than 5mins, and they even bought back my 2 year old S5. Battery life is much better than the S5, which would have to be charged it before leaving work. The S7 is usually about 50% (off and on use throughout the day) by the time my day is done. This phone is fast, crisp and clear picture, and has turned into my favorite phone. Try it out, you'll be glad you did.:2016-03-16:JGlock
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, would buy again, some gripes:"1st, love the phone. Vast improvement over my Galaxy s4. The screen is amazing, colors so vibrant. Everything works great as expected. Apps load very quickly. Would definitely recommend. My gripes? Coming from the s4 and s3 and Blackberry, I am used to the plastic feel. The s7 being made with more metals and glass on the back, I am very over cautious and afraid of breaking it! I opted for an Otter Commuter case instead of a minimalist case because I am just so afraid of damaging it! Samsung: WHY DID YOU REMOVE THE IR BLASTER??? Was using the s4 as my home theater remote...no more. Disappointed. Ultra-fast scrolling in Apps like Facebook are still not as fast/fluid as iphone. It isn't bad, its actually pretty good, but I would love to see Samsung match the evil empire's fluidity because then there wouldn't be anything the Galaxy couldn't match on the iphone. Thankfully the expandable memory is there, had it on my s4, would have hated to not have it. Camera is awesome, love the new features, make sure you download the new ""modes"" like rear camera selfie!":2016-03-16:amallano
Samsung Galaxy S7:Definitely better then the S6:I had the S6 and enjoyed it. I thought that was nice but the S7 is so worth it. The feel of the phone is alittle lighter and feels oh so smoother. I love that the camera and home button are flat and not sticking out anymore. Same awesome sound quality as the s6. I thought the battery was long lasting on the s6, this phone definitely out dose it. It is faster and more responsive all together then the s6 and so far no occasional annoying pop ups like the s6 had. The extra storage and waterproof features are a plus. The camera photos are more crisp and bright. It controls the lighting better. I like the new mini control feature that can pop up when you're playing a game or app. It allows you to silence calls while you're playing and lock your home buttons if you want so you can't accidentally exit. There is so much more to explore I can't even think of upgrading in the future, this phone has everything I wanted!:2016-03-16:Eve8885
Samsung Galaxy S7:All the good things about the S5 plus more:"I had the Samsung Galaxy S5 for a year and half and really enjoyed it as a phone. It was highly customizable, expandable memory, reliable, had a good battery life (and the option to throw in a new battery should I run through one), and overall performed very well.  It did have its issues, which in my opinion were iffy camera quality in low lighting and some lag with processing power. After a year and half I was noticing overall slower performance and heating issues.  Where the S6 abandoned all the good things about the S5, the S7 brought them back. I threw in a 200 GB memory card for all my music and photos, and the 32 GB capacity overall is much better for apps you want directly on your phone. The processor is FAST. Opening apps and browsing the web are a snap. The camera is beautiful - quick, crisp, clear.   The transition over from my S5 to the S7 was also incredibly painless. I was able to hook the 2 phones to each other with a piece included in the S7's packaging, and within an hour my new phone had all the apps, photos, messages, contacts, and videos my old phone had.  The dust and water rating on the S7 are a huge plus. I did like that my S5 was water resistant, but the bulky charger flap was kind of awkward. this phone has removed all awkward bulkiness, including the protruding camera bump (the back is now more smooth and even rounded to hold).  I also got a wireless charging pad for my phone, and I think it's really cool. I don't use the fast charge for day to day stuff, but it's nice just to put your phone on the charging pad and wake up to a fully charged phone (sans wire.)  I also got an external battery in case I needed it throughout the day, but even with consistent usage the batter lasts me 10 hours at least, usually going 12 or more.  The phone looks slick, virtually no camera bump on the back (yay!), and you still have the heart rate monitor and other cool built in features I loved about my S5. No floating toolbox, but that is downloadable.  I recommend getting some kind of case, because the exterior shows all smudges and smears because it is such a slick, shiny phone. Also, it is an expensive and impressive piece of tech, def. worth protecting. I got a clear spigen to protect the phone but also show it off.  I am so excited to have switched over, I reallllllly love my S7 :D":2016-03-15:vtbo
Samsung Galaxy S7:easy to use, great design:I upgraded from a S4. Worth the upgrade. I love the new curved design. It is easier to hold and grips better in my hand. With double the ram from the S4 I can do many things at once and it doesn't slow down. New UHD screen with a beautiful picture and the camera is much improved. I think it takes much crisper pictures than my wife's (not android) phone. You won't regret buying this phone!:2016-03-15:Baxman
Samsung Galaxy S7:Smooth and Fast upgrade from S4:I love the quickness of the camera and launching apps. The battery life is great but that is expected for a new phone I guess. Much louder speaker and clearer than my S4. I am glad I waited for this one. I saw the S6 but wasn't ready to ditch my S4. My old phone messed up copying data over to new phone but hooked up cable as S7 did the rest. Smooth interface and load times are great. I haven't tried getting it wet but it looks and feels like it can handle it. Just not going to go swimming with it lol.:2016-03-15:Joshfinne
Samsung Galaxy S7:So far so good.:Lots of compliments on gold colorway. Phone is very good. Speedy and intuitive. Camera good not great. Overall the best phone I have ever owned.:2016-03-15:Jonatin
Samsung Galaxy S7:Best Galaxy yet:As all the reviews out there will tell you, there are few if any flaws with the new S7. I just traded in my Edge +, which I loved, but got tired of the larger size not fitting into any regular sized pocket. Additionally, I love that Samsung added back the SD card capability along with the water resistance and dust proof. Performance is outstanding.:2016-03-15:SeverusS7
Samsung Galaxy S7:LOVE this phone:I consider this easy to use, but I used to have a Galaxy III so am also pretty familiar with Galaxy features. I actually paid off an LG4 I only had for a few months to get the Galaxy 7. Now, with the 7, I can talk on the phone without dropping calls when people text or message me or dial in. It is smaller, which I prefer than the LG4 or the Edge - it can fit in a pocket much easier. I have horses, so the water and dust resistance is terrific. The only thing I wish could be different is where the power button is located. It is too easy to hit and get the black screen. Well worth that minor irritant though. LOVE it, LOVE it. Also it would be nice if the battery lasted longer. That was the ONLY thing the LG4 had as an advantage. Galaxy is the way to go.:2016-03-15:LuPicasso
Samsung Galaxy S7:This phone has great features than many others:Good design, battery lasts up to 3 days with normal use. Easy to use. Fast charging.!!!! Multiple features for camera.:2016-03-15:Anicaden
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great camera, Wireless charging finally works:I had the s6 edge for a short while. With a Samsung charging pad it would charge up and then stop with an error on the charger and discharge overnight. Same pad works flawlessly with the S7. I have had the phone for a week now, no problems encountered.  Camera takes great low light pictures, looks great on the screen and on other computers. No perceptible delays snapping shots.  I just added a 64g memory card, no surprises and it automatically reconfigured to store pictures on it.:2016-03-15:JohnnyH
Samsung Galaxy S7:Giving this 5 stars!:Have had many different brands of smart phones. This one is, for my use, the best one ever. Would recommend it to anyone.:2016-03-14:Badnova
Samsung Galaxy S7:A worthy Upgrade:I finally upgraded from my 3 year old Galaxy S3 and WOW what a difference! I was disappointed with the S6 and I am glad I held out for the S7! This thing is FAST, Easy to use and the camera takes incredible pix! It was great to be able to transfer all my aps with the smart transfer feature or whatever its called. Even worked without issue with my old S3. Battery life seems to be excellent also. As I type this my phone has been off the charger for 11 hours now, and I've been using it most of the day, and I still have 70% of the battery left.  If you've been holding out like I was, you don't have to any longer.:2016-03-14:TinIndian42
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love this phone, I jumped ship from the iphone 6 and love this phone!:I have always wanted the customization of android but in the past, found it hard to do things easy, but this phone is awesome! I love it! It feels so good and smooth and the personalization is great.:2016-03-14:Ddegraw
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy s7:Love the phone just a great phone out performed most other phones:2016-03-14:RYAN33p
Samsung Galaxy S7:So far, one great device!:I just received my S7 on Friday, March 11th; to replace my S4. Out of the box I was impressed with the structure and the familiarity of the new S7. The transfer of my files, pictures, contacts, video's, accounts, settings, and apps was smooth and flawless. I simply backed everything up (which took the longest amount of time), and then turned on the wireless transfer app (Android Beam) and touched them together and bam! All my stuff was transferred to my new S7 in a matter of minutes - flawlessly. I was impressed with how fast the phone charges - minutes, I mean literally minutes, folks. The fingerprint log in is outstanding and easy to set-up and use. Pictures are beautiful, even though the rear is only 12mp's; and the front camera is just as good, even at only 5mp's. The low light setting for the camera is just - wow! On my S4 a dark room would have been completely blacked out; however, on the S7 it is visible, albeit with a yellow hint, which is to be expected from such low lighting. I don't plan on taking too many pictures in a dark room, so think I can deal with that. Love how the apps for Verizon, Google, and Amazon are grouped into one icon - fabulous - takes up less space in the apps pages. On my S4, I had 4 or 5 pages of apps; now I have 3 pages total. I took it to work with me on Saturday and the battery lasted all day long - it has yet to go below 65% without needing a charge. I topped it off this morning before going to work, and right now it is still at 87% - this is fantastic. My old S4 would have to be charged everyday - not the S7. Of course the real test will come on Thursday when I am off, and can really sit and play with it. Then we'll see how long the battery lasts before needing a charge. So, so far, I can't say enough about this phone. I have used the alarm to wake me up for work, and it is great at waking me on time. Texting is simple and pretty much the same as with the S4 I had, with the exception of the new emoticons added - I really like them. The screen is beautiful. And the fact that I have small hands, with it being narrower, I can actually use the phone one handed, where I couldn't with my S4. My S4 has now been passed on to my husband, and he is really loving it. I may have just created another Galaxy fan! Thanks Samsung and Verizon for another wonderful Galaxy product. I will update this review later when I have a little more time with my new S7 - but so far - I absolutely love it! If you are scared to buy a new phone before all the glitches have been worked out - don't be with the S7 - it is great, straight out of the box!:2016-03-14:mrshendricks072412
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone!:Finally replaced my Galaxy S3 with the S7. The difference is day and night. The S7 is very fast and the display is like the difference between SD and HD TV. Battery life also a great improvement. Phone has been on 12 hours today and I have been messing with a lot, and it still has 50% battery left. Will recharge from 30% in about 1.5 hours. Don't think any of these phones are worth the price we are being charged, but what can we do, if we want a great smart phone....they've got us. Regardless......this IS a great phone, I am happy with my purchase, would buy it again and would definitely recommend it.:2016-03-14:Andym0097
Samsung Galaxy S7:Best phone I've ever owned:This phone can do everything but launch a rocket. Absolutely amazing features, wonderful feel in your hand and ease of use. Easily the best smartphone I've ever owned and would recommend to anyone.:2016-03-13:TheNerd247
Samsung Galaxy S7:Fantastic:I received the new phone a couple of days ago and could not be more happy. I finally decided it was time to move into the modern world and upgraded from a basic flip phone.  The Galaxy S7 is stylish, fast, and can do everything my iPad Air can do.  The set up was simple. I had sent my contacts through Backup Assistant to the cloud and by the time I finished going through the set up steps, my contacts and pic were on my new phone.  I connected to my Wi-Fi at home and updated the operating system, installed a few apps and I was all set.  Use of the phone is extremely intuitive. I like it better than the smartphone my wife has from a different manufacturer that shall remain nameless.  My voice sounds like it is in a chamber when I listen on my wife's phone, but her voice is crystal clear on mine. She has had issues with voice quality from other phones before.  I highly recommend the S7.:2016-03-13:DandelionMan
Samsung Galaxy S7:The Smart Phone I have always been waiting for.:Years ago I tried android and didn't like it. I have been on Iphone for a long time. But I have grown so tired of Iphone that last summer I switched to windows phone. Still not what I was looking for. I started looking for a good android phone so I could give them another try. In my search I saw that Samsung was releasing a new Galaxy soon. So as I read rumors and expected features I grew anxious. Then when the announcement came and all the rumors were correct I said this is the phone for me. I pre ordered my Galaxy S7 and received it before the official sale date. I am super excited. Ok enough on how I got to android. Now about the phone.  This is the best phone I have ever held in my hands. Super fast, Expandable storage, Large Battery, Wireless Charging, Water Proof, Amazing Camera, And able to be customized to what ever your liking is. Samsung listens to what the customers want. Something Apple does not do.  I have been on Android for 5 days now and I am loving it compared to IOS and windows phone. If Samsung keeps putting out products like this they have a life long customer. But because I love this phone so much I doubt I will be trading it in when the next galaxy comes out. I'll hang on to this one for at least 2 years. Besides its going to be very very hard to top the very best phone ever made.  By the way, Wireless Charging is very fast. I also bought the Samsung Fast Wireless Charger. Well worth it. I also purchased a Case-Mate barely there Clear case and a tempered glass screen protector.  If any of you are IOS users or Windows phone users that are thinking of switching over to Android give the Samsung Galaxy S7 a try. I am sure you will be just as pleased with it as I am.  I highly recommend this phone. BUY IT!!:2016-03-13:scotiezND
Samsung Galaxy S7:Best phone I've ever owned!:This phone is absolutely amazing. It's blazing fast, very nice looking, and it feels so good! The only thing that I can say that I don't like about it is that the fingerprint scanner isn't completely accurate 100% of the time, but nothing really is.:2016-03-12:AHacker95
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesome phone!:"I upgraded to the S7 from an LG G2. I was looking to get a phone that would perform better in some areas that my LG was weak in, namely battery life, charging speed, lag time and camera quality. I am so pleased I decided on the Galaxy S7! It charges very quickly and so far the battery lasts a long time, and I use my phone quite a bit. It doesn't lag at all and is very fast. The camera is awesome! I don't notice much of a difference from my LG with the front facing camera, but the rear facing one is amazing! No lag time when taking pictures either. The ""Always on"" display is a neat feature, and it doesn't seem to be affecting battery life yet, but I will be turning it off if it starts.  The one thing I do find rather annoying is the fingerprints. I got the gold phone and wow does it show fingerprints. I have a case on it so it's not an issue but I feel like I could never display it without the case. The fingerprints make it look terrible.  Overall this is a great phone. I am very happy so far.":2016-03-11:Aeromeggy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Perfect sized beast:I must say this is a perfectly sized phone with absolutely all the features the S6 lacked and even more. I will be using this phone on my daily workouts so the waterproof feature will be very useful. I can also fit this phone perfectly in my purse or jeans pocket with ease. I love that they brought the expandable storage back as I love music and I also love to read ebooks and I was really weary about the onboard 32 gb storage.The color is gorgeous.The black onyx is a deep rich black. This phone is very responsive and super fast.I am still getting acquainted with my new phone but I must say I am so far loving it.:2016-03-11:ComputerLove
Samsung Galaxy S7:Talk about an Upgrade!:I upgraded to this device from the s4 because I wasn't ready to give up my microsd slot. I am sooooo happy they brought that back! This phone is amazing! the graphics are next level, it's so easy to use, and just flat out amazing. I just got it yesterday, and thus far I am very very pleased. The only thing I'm not too crazy about is the front facing camera. The camera use a default beauty filter, which enhances your photo and I'm not crazy about that. I'd prefer the photo to look more natural, like the Iphone 6S.:2016-03-10:crc4992
Samsung Galaxy S7:Amazing!:"I replaced my Samsung Note 3 with this phone as I wanted something a little smaller. Setup was a breeze. I used Quick Connect to transfer everything from the Note 3 to the S7. The phone is super fast and the screen is amazing. I haven't given the camera much of a workout yet. I am SO glad that I pre-ordered and that it showed up today!!!  The ONLY thing that I'm not liking for accessories is that the glass protectors that I've come across will only fit the flat part of the screen, so it's about 1/8"" from the edge of the phone, not even covering all of the viewable screen.":2016-03-10:SuzieQ2016
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy S7:I miss my theme and am disappointed in the limited ring choices, however appreciate the reliability and performance of the phone.:2017-04-22:Kathleen Ann
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7:I owned an earlier version of this phone plus other Samsung products which exceed expectations.  Never disappointed by Samsung.:2017-04-18:SammyS7
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy:Previous phone was samsung so it was an easy transition. I like the samsung brand. Will continue to use samsung:2017-04-18:Zeus2468
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love my new Samsung7s:I love the phone. There is just one thing I would change. The speaker is at bottom of phone and would like a front and back speaker. Too many times the speaker is blocked because is on bottom, but it is something I just need to get use to.:2017-04-17:CHELB68
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features but will learn:Still trying to get use to it  This is a new learning experience different from my old phone but I will learn over time:2017-04-17:Taler58
Samsung Galaxy S7:Another great phone in the Samsung Galaxy series:"I like the phone quite well with a couple of small issues.  First..it's a dust magnet!  Second..criminals should never own one because it hangs on to fingerprints like a magnet. A big issue:  the battery is still no where near as good as promised.":2017-04-16:mlaffoon
Samsung Galaxy S7:Still learning my first smart phone and so far it am VERY pleased:Being my first smartphone I am very much learning about the phone and features.  I am pleased so far and will probably give higher rating when I am more associated with the phone.  I'm not too happy about the signal strength being 50% less than my 10 year old phone I replaced..:2017-04-16:RichieS7
Samsung Galaxy S7:Don't love the changes:I use the microphone feature a lot and on the S7, it doesn't understand me very well, even though I am speaking the same way I did with my S5, and the suggestions for misspelled or misunderstood words are not even close to being relevant.  It's very frustrating.  On the other hand, the charge lasts and everything else is fine.:2017-04-16:AmyBB
Samsung Galaxy S7:Better than my S3 But....:I like the phone but have two major complaints.  The first is that I will the screens scrolled continuously.  That is a simple fix I wish they made.  Now I have to scroll through 4 screens to get to my last screen.  The second major issue is the incredibly annoying Flipboard app that is useless but takes away a screen and seems to link only to fake news.  After 5 minutes of looking at worthless stories I disabled it but wish I could remove it altogether.  The are better news apps but Samsung insists on using this garbage app.  Please get rid of it!:2017-04-15:CINCINNATUS
Samsung Galaxy S7:Happy With My New Phone:I upgraded from an S4 and overall, am very pleased.  The new phone has a couple of additional features I like and it seems to get coverage in areas where the S4 failed to grab a signal.  On the down side, the look, shape, and color of some of the standard icons is different and I don't like those changes.  Still, I'm happy I switched and I wouldn't go back.:2017-04-14:Codyco
Samsung Galaxy S7:It does what it is supposed to do I have very few problems and the ones I had I was able to figure out on my own with the help of Google:I have no clue what you want here said it all above ?mmmmmmmmmkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkjjhhggggggggggggggggggg:2017-04-14:Djh_
Samsung Galaxy S7:Hard to get around. Miss not being able to take a. Class on operation of phone:Hard to use at first need class to familiarize self with phone. Age may have something to do with it:2017-04-14:Emk1
Samsung Galaxy S7:verizons plans need to be better priced:not all of my texts and information transferred over from my old phone to my new one.  When i charge it at night, the screen turns to a multiple color screen, so i have to flip it upside down:2017-04-13:why bother
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it!:"I Love the phone, but due to work I need to use it very often, and the battery life in this, is just not enough, barely lasts me all day :(":2017-04-12:AmberK91
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7:Great phone with a fantastic screen. Fast performance. The how-to videos in the help section were great in quickly figuring out the things my new phone can do.:2017-04-12:JACKIELYNNE32321985
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy s7:It is easy  to use. Has sharp pictures. Good  ring tones to choose from,  and notification sounds are different which I like.:2017-04-10:Jmwl
Samsung Galaxy S7:Excellent device, but could use improvements.:"The Galaxy S7 is a handsome device and packed with many useful features.  But there are three concerns of mine: 1) The phone only provides 32GB memory on-board, most of which is taken up by the operating system and some unneeded apps. Even though the phone accepts a micro SD for added storage, most available apps can't be stored  to the SD card. 2) The micro SD card slot is mounted on a difficult-to-retrieve flat, ejectable surface, along with a slot for the tinier SIM card. As a result both are susceptible of falling and getting lost. Replacing the two cards requires much dexterity, as well.  3) The brief instruction pamphlet is practically useless, and unless one wants to spend much time in discovering by trial and error as to what the phone has to offer, a comprehensive PRINTED user manual should be included.":2017-04-10:Marshall 1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone!:I can't complain about this S7. The transition to it was easy. Samsung keeps the operating system very similar while creating a superior product. I'm very hapy.:2017-04-09:Mar12strings
Samsung Galaxy S7:Happy and Content:I am very pleased with my new Samsung S7. I was in need of an upgrade & thought about going straight for the S8 but to save myself some money I went with the S7 ad am very content with my choice. The functionally is great and I am really enjoying the camera features. It will be an excellent addition to my regular camera on an upcoming trip i have planned.:2017-04-07:Nuttalli
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features:Good product. Easy to figure out, extremely simple, self explanatory. Small design with great picture:2017-04-06:Pagil
Samsung Galaxy S7:My S7:A bit different from an I phone but just as functional. The clarity of the screen is great, pictures are awesome and its easy to use once you get used to it:2017-04-06:John88888
Samsung Galaxy S7:review!:The phone itself is fantastic. I love Samsung. The only real draw back is the glass on both sides because it makes the phone very slick. I would highly recommend getting a case when you buy the phone. I had it for 3 days and accidently dropped it because it slippery. I am used to the s5 active which had a rubber back. Other then that I love this phone. The keys at the bottom of the screen are very sensitive so be careful of that.:2017-04-06:bekschenck
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easier to use:Works 10 times easier than the 6 edge I had. The speed of phone is excellent and graphics if great. +:2017-04-05:Dolfin65
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice upgrade:I don't need a lot of features, but the Galaxy has some really useful tools. The fingerprint security is a little finicky to use.:2017-04-05:lorik1509
Samsung Galaxy S7:Makes a lot of things easier:A great phone...love the improvements. ..the battery life is great also...showing it to all my friends:2017-04-05:Sue8372
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone lots of memory:I like the phone but I see minimal difference to my S5. More memory is a huge plus. I didn't go with the edge because I don't stream video much so the edge wasn't worth the money. Wish the phone was larger like the note.:2017-04-04:Lovemyboy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Hard switch from the Note:Functionality is great,  the screen and notifications are much too small.  I work on my phone so, the size os making it pretty difficult:2017-04-03:Firechickie119
Samsung Galaxy S7:Cool features:My new Samsung Galaxy S7 is a very good cell phone. The camera takes excellent photos. Apps are well placed. Plenty of storage. Fits nicely in my pants pocket. Reception is crystal clear. I was way overdue for a new phone.:2017-04-02:Rascal1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Don't the how the screen rappers off.:I do not like the way the glass screen protector fits on the Galaxy S7. The glass doesn't stick to the outer edge of the phone and will eventually peel up more.  I do however the the camera love the camera on the phone as well as some other simple things.:2017-04-02:Samiam1992
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice upgrades:Nice upgrades to my last phone, the S4. Easier to access settings and all apps in the app manager. Text messages a little confusing...more than one app for texting or cloud saving is not necessary. Google and Verizon both should not need to store info...pick one and stick with it.:2017-04-02:Popnanne
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone:Good phone for work , I wish they come with a bigger screm as Well, but good in overall.  Recomended:2017-04-01:Joseburgos01
Samsung Galaxy S7:Still getting use to it. Went from iPhone to Samsung:I am still getting used to the phone and Android operating system. I came over from a ape iPhone iOS and still taking me a while to get used to this phone.:2017-04-01:BillJ123456789
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone that i never had ever since my first phone:Im very please with this phone because its easy to use, app features is good, texting is very good no compliments about that, and takes very good pictures. im very please with this phone:2017-03-31:christinadixon
Samsung Galaxy S7:Different:Different than the note 5 I had. Smooth running phone, many updates, clear photos, no concerns yet...:2017-03-31:Kandie33
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features. There are a few things that I miss, but they are insignificant.:I love my new phone. I'm technologically challenged and it's fairly user friendly.Even though I'm still learning I love this new phone.:2017-03-31:cbowman58
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone is nice:Too expensive...network needs to lower their plans. Probably will switch in the near future.if other networks can do it so can Verizon:2017-03-31:Ton Brooks
Samsung Galaxy S7:My new Galaxy s7 review:I really like my Galaxy s7 it's easy to use, love the size. The applications are easy to load and use. Just getting to know the features.:2017-03-29:Direct Direct DiDi
Samsung Galaxy S7:So far...so good:One week...battery is what I notice most...awesome longevity!  Don't like the small keyboard but adjusting.  Only option I've found so far for that is the ugly colored larger.:2017-03-29:Grizadams
Samsung Galaxy S7:It'sounds okay:I am having trouble holding it - it's smaller, it's slippery to hold. Dropped it once already, the protective screen cover cracked, but not the screen, thank god. My Galaxy S5 was textured so easily held. And having a lot of trouble txting. Very frustrating.:2017-03-28:PeggKatt
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the extra storage space for pictures and videos:Love the extra storage space just wish the apps didn't keep crashing and I also wish the battery lasted longer.:2017-03-28:Mandpanda30
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's very slick - literally:"I went from the S5 to the S7 and expected the phone to be larger, but it wasn't. I guess that shouldn't be something I'm disappointed about, but I kind of am. But, once I got all my apps and contacts etc. downloaded, it's a very nice phone. Response times are quite speedy and the battery life is WAY BETTER. I'm on day 3 without charging, but I think this will be it.  One large complaint - all the exterior surfaces of this phone are too slick. As in, you can barely hold onto it - seriously. There is NO WAY you can operate this phone without a separate case. I opted for the Speck case and it's working quite well, but it would be nice if it wasn't so absolutely necessary.  Some of the features that I had on the S5 that are similar, but not exactly the same: 1. when turning the phone on, there is a side-swipe required before the security screen. I don't really understand why. The security screen is the same function, so why the need for the swipe, too? 2. My S5 recognized when you were in a ""familiar"" location and would bypass the security screen. The S7 started to do that, but then stopped for no apparent reason. I'll have to chat with Service to figure out how to enable that feature because all my efforts to figure it out on the Settings screens have been for nought. 3. Love the camera! and the fact that you can quickly access it by pressing the home key twice is great. On the S5, it took forever to get to the camera. This is a great improvement on the S7.":2017-03-28:RuSH6789
Samsung Galaxy S7:Always willing to help:I wish the calendar would allow me to select a date either in the past or future. At least I haven't figured it out if it does.:2017-03-27:Zayda092009
Samsung Galaxy S7:The transition has been fairly easy.:I like the phone and features. It fits my lifestyle and technical savvy. Mostly I have enjoyed the overall experience with Verizon.:2017-03-27:slhenderson
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone, but I miss my Note 4 with pen!!!:Great phone, very fast downloads and installs as well as uninstalls. My only gripe is the size, I had the Note4 before upgrading and I loved that phone with it's pen! I only upgraded because the Note4 battery was shot! Really have not had this phone long enough to check out all of it's features, but so far, so good!:2017-03-27:Finsta58
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7:I love all the features of my s7 except for one or two. There is a screen that pops up right after a screen shot is taken that is annoying. Also the cartoon filter in the camera is gone like the s6 had. I loved that feature.:2017-03-27:Beedler04
Samsung Galaxy S7:The operation is different than my old phone. It will take a while to get to 5 stars.:None that I need to mention. None that I need to mention. None that I need to mention. None that I need to mention.:2017-03-27:Carolynlazz
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition battery is a disappointment:I like my Samsung. But battery is always a disappointment.  I am probably a heavy user,but why should I be judge for it. Battery life 8hrs max:2017-03-27:Francois
Samsung Galaxy S7:Upgrade newbie:Text video was less than expected. Emails, calls, sound, speed, pictures are all excellent. Battery life is poor compared to the Droid turbo 2 that I came from, but is much more user friendly than the Motorola. Happy Samsung Galaxy 7 customer here.:2017-03-25:Darnella
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use.:Just getting to use some of the features, only had less than a week. Need to play with  and use more.:2017-03-25:Do not  have  nickname
Samsung Galaxy S7:Miss my Galaxy s4:"I don't like that the screen curves off the edges, it makes it hard to do anything on the phone with one hand. My thumb pad will be clicking on something while my hand is trying to click something on the edge, it's pretty annoying. Hopefully my case will fix this issue. Also, it's very fragile. Thank God I purchased the coverage for damage because I dropped it after 2 days of owning it (I have a case ordered, it just hasn't arrived yet) and the screen broke in two different places from a 2 foot drop. I had my last phone for 4 years and dropped it hundreds of times and it never broke. :( I miss my old phone but this one is way faster, takes much better photos, and the battery life is better.":2017-03-24:sfhshshs
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Display and Sound...:The transition from iPhone to the S7 took some work getting the voice mail to work when using the same number...The phone is beautiful and easy to use. The phone connected to wireless printer with no problems and transfer of contacts worked well..I'm disappointed with the stated Battery times from Verizon and they are not accurate, they fall short by half....if you use no data or apps the call time is good but apps run in the background and you can't stop them...The good thing is the phone charges quickly and I will keep it because it looks and works great...Also the camera is awesome..:2017-03-24:Preciousbz
Samsung Galaxy S7:So far, so good...:I had used an S4 from a friend, and it was great.  I bought a refurbished S5 back in October of 2016, and it only lasted six months.  Even though I had insurance and it was still under warranty, I didn't want yet another refurbished phone and possibly have the same problems again.  I decided to start with a brand new phone, and liking the Samsungs, I purchased the S7 and so far it's been a good phone. I'm still getting used to the features; it took me awhile to find the text voicing, since that was a little different than it was in the past.  All in all, I'm pleased with the phone.:2017-03-22:nett777
Samsung Galaxy S7:Changing most features over was easy:I can't figure out the hidden setting the is not allowing get me to access mobile data while on a call:2017-03-21:Smy1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Sexy, powerful phone with so so battery:The phone is thin and an ideal size with a very good screen. This phone is very slippery without a case but I found a great case for it and a good screen protector.I like the minimal buttons to accidentally push on the sides of the phone and the sound quality is very good. The battery life was less than expected but the Samsung charger is very fast. I am very careful with my phones and still have a very hard time getting one to last two years so I am hopeful that that this one will be as durable as it is beautiful!:2017-03-19:Jeff T
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the phone. Miss the Infrared femote for Tv.:Like the phone. Miss the infra red capability. Storage slot for the micro card to upgade memory is awesome.:2017-03-18:Bdybldr2
Samsung Galaxy S7:First Time Galaxy S7:A first time owner, a little learning curve but this old guy is learning new tricks.  Like the fast charge on the battery.  Good phone.:2017-03-18:AZGeorge
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy 7:I like the fact that I could transfer all my information from my old Samsung Galaxy phone to my new one I also like to speed up my new phone:2017-03-18:Jamiekoe
Samsung Galaxy S7:Second Galaxy series phone:Old phone died.  Battery length a problem all along and still have to charge multiple times with new one:2017-03-17:Beachgranny
Samsung Galaxy S7:new phone:"Phone was easy to transfer information.   Only issue has been ""allowing"" apps to share as sometimes it changes the settings itself and I must try to figure out why I cannot see contacts in certain apps particulary What's App":2017-03-17:Indiana gal
Samsung Galaxy S7:Really good phone, major upgrade from my old S3:My old phone was a Galaxy S3...still functional, but not really keeping up with the times. I like Samsung products in general, so upgrading to the S7 was a no brainer for me. Also, I received a Samsung Gear S3 for my birthday and the two work together really well. My only real complaint is it's a lot heavier than my old phone, but I'm getting used to it. I also had to do a full upload-to-cloud and download for my old phone because the direct-connection transfer didn't work / wouldn't connect.:2017-03-16:BeccaM
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone easy to transition from the S5 and S6:Very pleased to see no major changes yet nice enhancements.  I would like to see the same tones (notification) moved to the new phone. Not an issue really just get used to the tone being email etc and they change:2017-03-15:breakpoint
Samsung Galaxy S7:A big improvement over my former model:"I like the size and the ease of use. I set up my device to meet my unique needs. I don't like the ""hard"" installed apps that are difficult or impossible to remove. I simply deactivate them as they are more of an annoyance that a benefit.":2017-03-15:medrmemo
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition from my last phone.:Great network coverage and reliability! Easy to work with and transition to from my last Samsung Galaxy phone.:2017-03-15:Schackert
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung gallaxy S7:I would have like a different color but it's awsome besides that. This is for my girlfriend. Ima be waiting for the note8:2017-03-15:Kkkkkkkkk
Samsung Galaxy S7:Different color wiuld have been great:I wanted a darker color but was never avaiable so I settled for the gold. Not happy but living with it:2017-03-14:Nashan
Samsung Galaxy S7:Has a mind of its own:Overly sensitive, it goes off opening things on its own.  Very difficult to enter on the keyboard even after making it bigger.  Response time is good and so far the battery seems to last longer and charge faster then the S4.:2017-03-13:Snowmama
Samsung Galaxy S7:Was an easy transition.:My daughter and I are enjoying our new phones and features. We are discovering new features each day.:2017-03-13:Catchmeoutside
Samsung Galaxy S7:its alriight:Its faster the camera is better and in general better, it works similar to my 4 so i have some brand loyalty. it is pretty darn expensive though:2017-03-12:doox2
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone easy switch from an S3:This would have been a 5 start but store kept trying to put tempered glass on my screen but it would not seal. When I got home with out a screen protector I noticed the edges of the S7 were not flat against the screen.the screen is raised and had to slope down to meet the edge of the phone.  I still love the phone but would like a good screen protector.:2017-03-12:Jnun
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone....:"This is a great phone, intuitive and fast. The only challenge is the battery life. I ride this pretty hard, and on tough days I am back on the charger by 2:00 in the afternoon. BUT, that being said, I would still get this phone again!":2017-03-12:Godzleebo
Samsung Galaxy S7:S 7:i miss my Calendar options from the Galaxy S.5.  This Samsung S 7 does not have the Emoticons to mark my calendar.:2017-03-12:MaaZo
Samsung Galaxy S7:Review:Has great camera, like the split screen option. The phone is very powerful with running multiprograms at once.:2017-03-11:Coz007
Samsung Galaxy S7:Works as intended!:Really like the reliability and look of the s7. It's a very user friendly phone. I love the wireless charging very handy!:2017-03-11:Shadowthrope
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery goes dead within 6hrs, shortens everyday. I loved my New phone 5 months but later missed many photos videos and memories  as it goes dead:Battery does not stay charged All Day. It gets shorter everyday..I have missed many memories lately with photos  and videos  because it goes dead 1/2  way thru the Day..:2017-03-10:O LAURA
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not too bad!:Phone is really nice. Graphics are clean and clear. Love the crisp.pictures from the phone. I do miss some of the features my S5 could do that this one doesn't, but I'm learning to live without them.:2017-03-10:DR84
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it so far.:I had a flip phone. So to be honest, anything was better. I use to have an S5 and theres not much difference in my opinion. I wish ot had 64GB instead of 32GB. And it had way too many unnecessary predownloaded apps. So 4/5:2017-03-09:Jayehm3
Samsung Galaxy S7:I really love my S7!:The only reason for the 4 star rating is that I haven't had enough time to discover all its features!:2017-03-08:Noneeeeeeee
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:This is a easy phone to use for work and play like that is 32 g phone many features and great memory:2017-03-08:Joe dawg
Samsung Galaxy S7:Space key doesn't work well when texting:The phone is about the same as the galaxy 6. The camera is better. The only problem I am having is the space bar while texting.:2017-03-08:Jackyr99999
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not much different from s6..:Not big difference from s6, battery life could be better, too many Samsung app pre-installed........:2017-03-08:Rimvis9999
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good transition miss my pretty face mode on your Samsung Galaxy 4:So much easier to use than iPhone and cheaper! The camera is great but still learning.  Hoping to get it down soon. Lol:2017-03-07:Sandymcpheronphipps
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it just wish it had one of the old features:Main feature I miss is the continuous scrolling.  Charging port is a tad tight, and scared going to damage phone.  Other than that seems to be a great phone.:2017-03-07:TheBsOfIA
Samsung Galaxy S7:Cool phone, bad battery:The phone features a lot of awesome upgrades from my Droid Turbo. It feels faster, has a clearer display and bettwr audio output. With the addition of the removable memory on the S7 it was very clear that I would like this phone so I could fit all of my music. The only downside to this phone is it's battery. Sporting 3000 mHa conpared to the 3700 mHa from my Droid Turbo it's taking a lot of getting used to. My biggest gripe was having to read forums on how to save battery as the S7 has many features that use battery that you might bit be aware of and then having to hunt them down and shut them off. Overall it's a good phone though, and the battery issue can be solved pretty well by carrying an external battery or just the charger on general.:2017-03-07:Rugg Doctah
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:It's a nice phone. I have always loved Samsung and am extremely happy with the phone and the details of the phone.:2017-03-07:Malb9
Samsung Galaxy S7:Enjoying new phone.:I like the features of the new phone as well as the feel, weight and screen.  I'm disappointed that it doesn't seem to have the same network strength in my home as my last phone (Samsung S5).:2017-03-06:LO21430
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy s7:I like it but I'd love it if I had more storage space on phone itself. I do like that I can have a SD card again. I'm happy with my new phone. It wasn't hard to transition I did have galaxy s6. I love the camera! Battery life not too good.:2017-03-06:Rebecca7769
Samsung Galaxy S7:Upgraded features with a familiar look and feel:My new Samsung Galaxy S7 is a solid upgrade from my previous S5 phone.  It has upgraded features, faster operating speed, all while keeping things similar to past versions for a smooth and easy upgrade.  Would definitely recommend one!:2017-03-06:UMNRolo
Samsung Galaxy S7:Wife likes:The phone allows me to add apps which improves communications with my wife when either of us are traveling.:2017-03-05:Fredt69
Samsung Galaxy S7:Smart choice:My first smart phone. Yes I am behind the times. Super user friendly I am very happy I chose the S7.:2017-03-05:Mel1010
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very nice phone...:If I had never had a Note I would be crazy about this phone. The features are great, it's easy to set up and use. It takes fantastic pictures! No cons yet. I just loved my Note and wanted another one of those. I was going to wait for the 8, but bought a new S2 Gear classic that just would not work well with my old phone. It works flawlessly with the 7. Thanks!:2017-03-04:MSEnglish
Samsung Galaxy S7:Almost perfect.:I absolutely love this phone. Blazing fast performance, beautiful display, decent stock features. However, its audio really kind of drops the ball. My S7 has a relatively common issue, being the audio often crackles both through the speaker and when plugged into an aux input on a home or auto stereo system. There is a temporary fix made by tweaking the audio settings, but it always comes back. Also the speaker is fairly quiet compared to my old HTC One M9's stereo speakers, and even the output to external audio devices is quiet in comparison. Overall, it's still a great phone despite its shortcomings. I'm hoping a future software update will fix the crackling audio issue.:2017-03-03:Zach M
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy upgrade:It was an easy transition from my Galaxy S6. Too bad that it is slightly different in size and required a new cover. I still had about 7 months to go on my S6 but suddenly the screen blacked out.:2017-03-03:hank2017
Samsung Galaxy S7:new camera:liked Samsung phone, including features and ease of use.  everything easy to access, so wwhen the camera stopped working I had no problem going back for a new Samsung.  Was told features were same only better so purchased the newest model.:2017-03-02:susieq 22
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone. Seamless transition from s5:A great device. Software wise I wish the mail program made it as easy to erase junk files as it was on the S5:2017-03-02:LloydMc
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition but disappointing battery life:Phone easy to use; no problem transitioning from Galaxy S-4.  However, battery life is disappointing.  Several days, with only modest usage, battery ran out in early evening.:2017-03-02:Dan19119
Samsung Galaxy S7:I like all of the features of the S7.:As much as I like the phone I did have to exchange for another one.  The phone locked up twice within two days of starting with the new service.  I got another new phone and had it lock up three times within the first week.  I need to exchange it for another phone.:2017-03-01:chocolatemom
Samsung Galaxy S7:Few integrated upgrades:Basically the same as the galaxy s5 I've had for almost three years.  So far the integrated flashlight is the biggest ready usable upgrade a opposed to downloading a flashlight app.  Audio via an aux cord still plays entirely too low,stereo must be turned almost to max which leads to buzzing sound most of the time. The split screen apps could prove to be useful after further use.:2017-03-01:txwoodslinger86db
Samsung Galaxy S7:My new Verizon phone:I love it. The only problem I have is that I can't sync it with my PC unless I purchase a program that costs $$ per year.  I wish there was a way to sync my phone using a Samsung app.:2017-03-01:Nice new phone
Samsung Galaxy S7:Ease of Use:Traded in my Samsung Galaxy 5 so the transition was easy.  I did find newer features on the phone helpful.  I disliked the extra software on the 5 and glad to see not much on the new 7.:2017-03-01:CPBear
Samsung Galaxy S7:Was hoping for a bit more:Took longer than it should have to get old S5 data moved to the new S7.  Was caught a bit off guard that S7 does not have removable battery ... hoping the battery life is better than was the S5 or I'll be hurting in 12 months.  While my S5 plastic back to the phone had cracked, the S7's all metal case is much slicker and I felt compelled to buy a case for it as I am afraid I might drop it because it is so slippery.  In all other respects, the phone is thus far meeting my expectations.  Some of the Samsung UI has been changed a bit but that happened with Samsung / Android updates too so no major pain there.:2017-02-28:DanNWestNY
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nearly there:Simply put this phone has everything. It's easy to understand and begin learning it's new features. I took one star because I live in an area where the service stinks. It's not Samsung but I recently had an Asus Zenfone 2 and it worked great so I'd like to challenge Samsung to increase its reception hardware and they will have a perfect phone for everyone:2017-02-28:JamalKing2020
Samsung Galaxy S7:Just like using my Tab S2 - Easy and Familiar:Samsung S7 is great, solid performance and familiar function to our Tab S2. Good screen, great interface and good battery life. Love the apps options and seamless updates.:2017-02-28:Photoquests
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone is great but...:"I really like the phone but the screen protector that was sold to me is complete garbage. It doesn't work with the slight curve of the screen so I have major touch response issues with anything that falls into the ""foggy areas""":2017-02-28:TheTonyTone
Samsung Galaxy S7:I've always been a Galaxy Guy:I love the device.  I'm very familiar with the galaxy line.  However I do wish there was a button while on a call to put someone on hold being on the Verizon  network. T-Mobile  offers that feature. It lets you know when someone puts you on hold. Besides that everything else is great. Battery could last a little longer that hough.:2017-02-27:Phyzik
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love this phone.  The notification light is awesome.:Very sleek design. Fingerprint secure feature is awesome.  Like that I can change the fonts and sizes. The screen is crisp and clear.:2017-02-27:debsh
Samsung Galaxy S7:Its a Phone...:I've had it for one week tomorrow.  Thus far, it is working just like my tablet does, but with phone capabilities.  I do not like the stock Verizon apps that came with it though.:2017-02-27:Boof1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Like galaxy s7:This  phone is similar to my old phone. The camera and photos are much clearer and sharper. The color is also more accurate. Haven't had much of a problem getting used to the differences.:2017-02-27:Patty51gl
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy s7:Good phone. Feels like a downgrade from my note 5. Smaller screen. Battery life seems smaller to me. No stylus. Hasn't given me problems other than that.:2017-02-27:Emprex500
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love My Samsung:Love the features, easy to use.  I have always trusted Samsung products.  Great quality in style, functionality, and sound!:2017-02-27:rain5
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone battery life could be better:The Samsung phone is easy to use and I'm familiar with android operating systems. The accessories are easily available and there are many to choose from.:2017-02-25:Jsn1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use, fantastic device:Great device I love samsung products, and the s7 is awesome it does heat up when I'm charging which could be fixed, and when I connect to WiFi it lags a bit but all around great choice:2017-02-24:Smrsleepy085
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy s7:I'm only typing here because it made me. Now I need 60 more characters.  Almost there.  14 more to go.:2017-02-23:Kyeager97
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy change from Galaxy S5:The screen is a bit narrower and text too close to left border. Space bar frequently does not work when writing text so have to go back and it!  Annoying.  But, everything else is great!  Also, I like the weight and camera is excellent.:2017-02-23:Chuckie 2
Samsung Galaxy S7:My upgrade experience:Upgraded to Galaxy S7 and really like the phone, just the right size and features are great. Not much for change, but glad I did.:2017-02-23:TheRevAG
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good product:Great sharpness for photos.  Key pad seems smaller.  Hard to use accurately. Need to improve for slight vision impaired people.:2017-02-23:64young
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone:I like the camera on the phone and the flashlight is easy to get to and use. I don't like that I can't replace the battery myself, I would have to take it in or send it in if I ever have a problem with it.  I have only had my phone for a couple weeks and so far it works fine, the battery will hold a charge for about 40 hours with my usage.:2017-02-22:Lilshyguy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very few drawbacks to this awesome device:I would have liked a larger screen (having previously owned the Galaxy S5) however what the S7 lacks in size it makes up for in picture, speed and functionality.:2017-02-21:Kittehsmash
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Samsung Product:I have always leaned towards Samsung Products. I wish Samsung would have left the IR blaster for TV remote in place. This was a great feature that I used often in previous Samsung phones. Removable SD card would have been nice too. Great phone none the less.:2017-02-21:zerogravity779
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesome phone......but.....:"Great design and features. Worth every penny but the initial set-up is anything but intuitive. I had to dig deep into the Android forums to figure out why it wouldn't save text message photos to the gallery (some arcane app permissions). I still can't figure out why this phone wont display all my Gmail categories. My old Galaxy did but even when I add my ""important"" catagory to the list with ""add folders"" it is gone again when I re-open my e-mail app. Same with custom text message alerts for my contact list. I have them set in contacts but when I receive a text, all I hear is the default tone. Frustrating.":2017-02-21:Mark N
Samsung Galaxy S7:Kinda Disappointed:Missing some of the features that my other phone had in play store. No free music in this phone like the other one. None that I like anyway. Some of the stuff is cool, but I rather have another phone like the one I just had. Disappointed in features but I do like Samsung products.:2017-02-21:Bullet_40
Samsung Galaxy S7:samsung:easy to use, easy transition from the Note 5.  Features are easy to use, Easy to get around all the phone apps and settings it offers:2017-02-20:marknewsamsung
Samsung Galaxy S7:galaxy s7 nice upgrade from galaxy s5:I like the tech coach program,have spoken to them twice so far about my phone.my phone needs to be restarted in order to make a phone call.they fix it it's fine for a few weeks than it acts up again.in fact I need to call again as we speak.:2017-02-20:golf nut
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's a good size. Faster then s4. Not apple:Yay for me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I get to pay too much for something I don't really need!!!!! M'rica:2017-02-20:Ppp I 6 Rex tum d pta6s
Samsung Galaxy S7:Transition:Went from flip phone to S7. Fairly easy to transition, although still getting used to touch screen. Love the ability to have better calendar and camera is much better. Don't love the feeling that I'm constantly being spied on.:2017-02-20:nickisntmyname
Samsung Galaxy S7:Enjoying my S7:I am enjoying my S7. I upgraded from a S4. The layout is a bit different, but still quite functional and easy to use. It has more capacity and storage space, which is always a plus.:2017-02-19:Samsung7
Samsung Galaxy S7:New:Just got my phone haven't had it for a month but it is not too much different from the Galaxy 6 so let's see how it goes:2017-02-19:Miss Jack
Samsung Galaxy S7:galaxy s7:The Galaxy S7 comes with too many pre-installed apps. Phone functions seem to be up to expectations.:2017-02-19:Juan E Tu
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:"I was worried initially about changing to a smaller phone. This has turned out to be only a slight problem to my ""old eyes"" lol. The camera exceeded my expectations and I've only just begun to explore what it can do. The speed of this phone is also a bonus. May be that my older galaxy was so slow but I'm amazed at how quickly I can accomplish a task. Still trying to adapt and get used to something new but can say I'm pleased overall.":2017-02-19:L1965
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love this phone only have one negative issue.:The issue is when tapping out a message or any type of typing on the phone when you get over to the right edge the touch screen stops working.  The reason I am told is because there is a slight curve to the screen along the edges and so when you try to tap the letters or numbers along the edge of the screen, your finger does not touch the screen completely.  Frustrating  If it wasn't for that I would give this phone a 5 star.:2017-02-19:Ziggytool
Samsung Galaxy S7:pretty, nice features, great screen and camera, more storage!:pretty design, decent weight and size, yay fingerprint scanner!, good sound and better speaker/speakerphone placement, fantastic improvement on the camera, fast charging is great. i still think there's room to improve with speaker/speakerphone placement, and maybe placement of earbud jack, maybe mini-usb/power too. really good stuff overall, though.:2017-02-19:jlbrown81
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition, not a lot of new features:Charges faster and has a great screen. My advertised memory card has not shown up. Within the first week, I had an alarm that would not go off, even after I restarted my phone. (Used the same application on Galaxy S5 for years without an issue.) But so far, that is the only issue.:2017-02-18:Sandra62
Samsung Galaxy S7:UGH!:"I struggle with learning how to use the programs after updates are installed.  Things change but they don't tell you how to use the. I get frustrated. I am 88 years old, could you make a phone for an old person :-)":2017-02-16:fred28
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very sleek- easy to use:I have had Samsung phones. I like that it talks to my other Samsung devices, its just as easy to use as my last phones.:2017-02-16:Rachele
Samsung Galaxy S7:great phone just too much waste on galaxy apps:It does everything I need to do for my job. I am a small business and it loads and works all the apps I need on the road.:2017-02-16:msjenx
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7:I don't use it to it's full potential, so for me it's about the same. I like the improved pull down menu for the added apps, much handier.:2017-02-16:4Chris
Samsung Galaxy S7:Happy though there seems to be a regular delay in accessing sites:Like the phone..upgraded from galaxy 4s mini ( tho prefer the smaller size of the mini). Having problems with speed of accessing sites...seems to be delays more times than not...need to call about this problem . Design is good, features good.:2017-02-16:Happyok
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesome:I like the cost and quality of coverage I like the representative that helped me with my purchase would recommend to a friend:2017-02-16:Jblol
Samsung Galaxy S7:Was easy to change from my other phone:The product is very good, easy to use. It is very nice looking, and light to hold. The brightness and sound are very good for even people with difficulty seeing and hearing.:2017-02-15:mita7164
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone, seems well built.:I like the overall quality and features of the phone. The only thing I don't like is where the power button is in relationship to the volume buttons.  When I go to turn up the volume I hit the power button.  It has happened several times. I wish the power button was on top or on the same side as the volume buttons.:2017-02-15:Really dude
Samsung Galaxy S7:LIKE IT BUT ...:"pretty nice device, and transition from S4 fairly straightforward, but cannot figure out, even with help of verizon drive and online forums, to activate/use some files that were transferred via smart-switch; they're there on the S7 but i cannot ""put"" them where i want them":2017-02-14:DRWINE
Samsung Galaxy S7:Slick, Fast and Cool.:The Galaxy S7 Gold is pretty awesome, not sure what else I can say.  I've had many types of phones in my time and this is by far the most intriguing, fun and responsive.:2017-02-14:gnatnug
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great quality for photos!:My only struggle with this phone is swiping for the drop down menu.  It doesn't always work.  It also takes extra effort when pushing on an app.  It has been easy to learn to use and I camera takes great photos.:2017-02-12:Sheila63
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone, Nice Design, Waterproof is a Big Plus:The phone is very nice, however I don't like the loss of privacy related to having to use a Google Account or Cloud to store and transfer data although this is a convenient feature on the go. I purchased a 32 gig card for added storage, this saves my picture and video content only, not contacts. Net Apps are nice and good camera.  Read the User's Manuel to learn new features.:2017-02-12:In the Boonies of NM
Samsung Galaxy S7:New Galaxy 7:I've my new phone for only one week. So far, so good! I'm still in the process of learning its features and how to navigate through the applications. There are a couple of questions that I have about things; however, I feel that I can consult the tech coach or work through the things that I want to know. I give the phone a 4 star right now because it's still too new to fairly rate it a 5.:2017-02-12:Joyce1
Samsung Galaxy S7:best photos ever!:After using the S4 for years I reluctantly bought new S7 when my internal memory filled. I knew I would have difficulty learning my way around any new device, and I was correct but that's on me. I'm not at all tech oriented and after 2 wks still can barely navigate myself through what should be easy functions. However, the ones that I can use are amazing. The camera takes photos that look professional. My S7 did also, but I was never able to capture the moon in any picture I took. This one is filled with new full moon shots from last night. The overall colors are bright and very appealing. I miss a couple things, like extra volume, battery replacement option and the fact I just can't seem to find how to do things. If I could, and again this is me not the phone, I'm sure this would be a 5 star review. I highly recommend this phone:2017-02-11:Marshalls GiGi
Samsung Galaxy S7:One disappointment:Better than my old S4 in every way (especially battery life and UI responsiveness), except one - no MHL support, which it doesn't work with the S3/S4 multimedia docks for analog audio output (or for charging either). Shoulda done my homework better so I'd have known this before buying (though I probably still would have anyway), but now I have to get new chargers and BT adapters.  Sigh.:2017-02-11:Mike Smith
Samsung Galaxy S7:Data issues:Phone is nice, works fine. Problem is I rechives a bunch of Emails stating I had 50%data, then received another stating I had 25% Data, then next day I received another stating I was out of data, and charged overage. Not happy.:2017-02-11:Glazer01
Samsung Galaxy S7:Change is slow for me so the transition is taking time:I like the looks, size, convenience and functions.  A good solution for some one that has one phone and likes photos and internet search. I have memory loss and information is quickly accessible to bring the memory back. I'm  interested in learning and the internet search is helpful. I tried to find shutter speed options in the camera but was not able to.:2017-02-10:45 weight
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it!  I should have got it sooner!:The phone is great!  Easy to navigate through and fits well in my hand.  New battery lasts pretty good and protective cases are easy to find.  Thanks for the phone Samsung and Verizon!:2017-02-10:Loretta stamper
Samsung Galaxy S7:New G S7:I like the design and functionality of the product compared to past phones.  the camera and video are good quality.:2017-02-09:bribol
Samsung Galaxy S7:New phone:Still getting used to it.  Trying to figure out features.  Message app not as intuitive as previous.  Having issues figuring out google maps and connectivity.  Doesn't seem to connect as well as previous - S4.:2017-02-09:Bill112458
Samsung Galaxy S7:my new phone:Pretty much the same as my S5, a few items are a bit of an upgrade like how easy it is to uninstall an app and viewing text messages when in other apps:2017-02-08:tbama
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7:I like the phone just wish it came in white. The black seems to masculine and gold isn't an ideal color either.:2017-02-08:Jamieshipp
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very similar to the S6.:Overall, I like this phone for its ease of use.  It is easy to get set up the way I like it and even easy enough my 3 year old grandson can get to his games.:2017-02-08:Goofballmama
Samsung Galaxy S7:Like old phone, almost:The transition to the S7 was relatively easy. A few glitches where I hit a key and something different. Muscle  memory is slow to transfer. I would have liked the off button at the top of the phone. I often touch it by mistake. Still wish I could delete apps I never use. My phone use is fairly simple. Email, text, facetime/Skype, Web search. I could use less phone, but nothing out there .....:2017-02-07:Frg310
Samsung Galaxy S7:The transition was pretty easy. No real roadblocks. Adopting new new stuff is no fun.:Nice size. Nice heft. Nice screen. I like the control buttons at the bottom of the screen. I don't like the control buttons on the side of the phone as they're too difficult to press. I like the app notifications and how they're visible without unlocking the app. It took me a while to find the phone's settings. They should be more visible. I couldn't find any documentation for the native apps ... even when I googled them on-line ... it makes it difficult to use their features. I love how the screen shows the date/time/battery/etc. when the phone is locked.:2017-02-07:BuzzHead059483726
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone:It is a little touchy when I try to answer a call but otherwise I really like it. The speed and picture quality are excellent.:2017-02-07:Happy day
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice features:Nice little phone. I had a note II and I loved it, I was looking forward to getting the note 7 but it got recalled. My old phone was starting to act up so I couldn't wait for the note 8 release, so I settled for the s7:2017-02-06:SSGTPepper
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice upgrade from  Galaxy s5 to s7:The Galaxy S7 is easy to use, it is a very nice size and weight, not too big too grip comfortably, crisp images.  Storage is questionable due to limited, unchangable amount. Must use cloud and that can get out of control.:2017-02-06:DSA13
Samsung Galaxy S7:Ok phone:Easy to use since its just a newer version of my old phone. Some of my apps won't transfer over like they are supposed to. But I guess it's ok. Everything else works fine on the phone.:2017-02-06:Javan99
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good:I miss my Otterbox. New case gives no protection of ports, very restrictive audio port. My audio plugs won't fit the case narrow opening. Bad design. Inferior to the Otterbox.:2017-02-06:northerner
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone, but WiFi doesn't always connect:Not much different than my old S6 Active, but the WiFi connection isn't the greatest.  Had the same issues on the Active. Not sold the upgrade was worth it yet.:2017-02-05:vmiarmor05
Samsung Galaxy S7:A phone:Ok it's an alright device Yall asking for too much  I have other stuff to do  Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii quit:2017-02-05:Phone 2
Samsung Galaxy S7:Frustrating:My contacts and calendar did not transfer completely so now I need to do it manually. The camera is not as good as I expected - it's not very fast and more photos than not are blurry.:2017-02-05:Mara77
Samsung Galaxy S7:Light and Thin:Nice layout. Black screen with time when not in use is a big improvement. I really dislike the fit of the screen protector...it's not wide enough, though it's supposedly made for this phone.:2017-02-05:Pink Floyd
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition from my Samsung S5:I didn't have too much to figure out that was different from the S5.  It just took me a few hours to get everything the way I had it on the old phone.  I'm still tweaking it.  I wish the battery charge lasted longer.:2017-02-04:LGMECO
Samsung Galaxy S7:I like the size and clarity of the display.:"Improved QWERTY: added numbers so that you know longer need to switch between alpha and numeric.  Easy to use.":2017-02-04:Murph2
Samsung Galaxy S7:The phone resembles an older Samsung with upgraded camera:"The Note was a more comfortable phone,I like the larger screen on the note, I Had the ""note"" a duplicate to the note would have been my choice, the rep., Nathan showed me the option and my bad I didn't pick the right phone, I'll live.":2017-02-04:Edsdog1
Samsung Galaxy S7:My Galaxy 7:"I'm still getting use to the phone.  I'm in my 50""s and a novice with the ever changing technology.  I like the basic functionality.":2017-02-03:My nickname or the phones
Samsung Galaxy S7:New phone:The phone was easy to transition to from my 5s. I dislike the power button being so low. Also dislike the clock screen staying on.:2017-02-03:Vkboa
Samsung Galaxy S7:was told that the 7 was bigger than the 4 and its not i need a large screen:I would have preferred a bigger phone screen but it seems like they are always out of what you want.:2017-02-03:katt113
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Features But A Pretty Step Learning Curv.:Difficult to get started, some basic instructions would be nice like how to find out where the apps are. I had to go to YouTube to find out hoe to use Google Play this should be one of the first and basic instructions.:2017-02-02:REDTWA
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery life is not good:Simply sitting on desk for 2 hrs & battery goes from 100% to 85%.  Drains faster if actually using phone.  Can't get a full day of modest use (no streaming video or other big power draws),  just checking email, check weather, use Google maps for a couple of minutes (not ongoing navigation).  By contrast my previous phone has drained 40% in 8 days of sitting idle.:2017-02-02:ThisPartIsUseless
Samsung Galaxy S7:Mrs.:This is not the typerson of phone I wanted this  is all they had at the time.  An it cost too much for what I have to pay.:2017-02-02:Millionier
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy trade in, easy set up.:Phone is similar to old phone. Nice upgrades to features, and overall look of the phone. The screen protectors on the market do not fit the slight contour of the screen very well, and affect screen sensibility somewhat.:2017-02-01:ZMike2
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great but some issues:Does not pair up with my car Bluetooth. Ongoing issue not resolved yet. Bad quality voice while on phone. Resolved by turning off advanced calling.  Otherwise I love the phone I think many more options than my S5.:2017-02-01:MChase
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone:Phone is a replacement for an LG G4 that died unexpectedly.  As such the S7 is a little small compared to the G4 which I thought really nailed the sweet spot on size.  The S7 also seems a little jittery or laggy at times compared to the G4.  Was afraid to buy another LG product after mine failed prematurely, allegedly due to corrupted files in a software update, and LG's failure to stand behind its product.:2017-01-31:Tbill4
Samsung Galaxy S7:So happy:I love having a galaxy 7 b/c I  really loved my galaxy 5. I still have a great deal to learn. But overall I'm pleased.:2017-01-30:Chris O of NJ
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good Phone:The S7 Edge is a good phone so far. It was an easy transition from my M8. I am still getting used to the S7 though.:2017-01-30:TCM5ive
Samsung Galaxy S7:East transition from my old phone:Super similar to the Galaxy S5 phone Some minor changes, but otherwise the same LOVE the extra space!:2017-01-30:joey71371
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition:Just upgraded from a Galaxy s5 to the Galaxy 7.  Easy and smooth transition.  The camera and extra storage is great!:2017-01-30:Esatterley
Samsung Galaxy S7:I love my new phone. I am still learning the many things it can do.:My phone has been Easy to learn how to use. I am 72 and old school. I have a lot to learn  a manual  would be nice.:2017-01-30:krafty lady
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice Features and Great Camera:The Galaxy S7 is a nice upgrade from my Galaxy S4. The phone is sleek and stylish (I bought it in gold tone). I like the Always On Display feature so I can quickly see the time and date on the standby screen. The camera is awesome. It is fast and captures great images. I gave it 4 stars because I think the battery should last longer.:2017-01-29:CandyT3
Samsung Galaxy S7:So far so good:This is my first smart phone.  It makes me feel a little dumb but I can do the most basic things fairly easily.  It's a work in progress.  Since I'm new to this type of phone so I'm not able to know if the design, features, and performance is good.:2017-01-29:DebbieKG
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good Phone:Overall this is a  good phone. I have never had any problems out of Samsung products. Only thing I don't like is you can't change the battery.:2017-01-29:B6048
Samsung Galaxy S7:it was not an easy transition from my core prime to this:A lot of different features I have to get use to. It is a very sensitive phone. I keep accidently going into an app I don't mean to Overall when I get used to it, it should be fine:2017-01-29:Harley Rose
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good Like The Apps:Like the ease of use and the apps are better than iphone that I had before the only thing is spell check is needed.:2017-01-28:kayekaye69
Samsung Galaxy S7:I love it so far:So far so good I just wish Verizon could drop there prices a bit that's all but everything else is great.:2017-01-28:Yeah buddy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great festures:Good phone. Great functionality and ease of use! The only reason not to give 5 stars was because I need to fill up the required number of characters to post a review.:2017-01-26:Erikhnh
Samsung Galaxy S7:Big improvements from my last phone:"Still learning the ins and outs of this phone. Hmm...not great battery life, but WAY more memory than I had on my last phone. Some of my ""go to"" buttons changed around a little, but that's mischief managed with time. Not sure if I care for the new placement of the headphones jack (it used to be on top, but now it's next to the charge cable jack) The memory is a lot more accessible, but how often does one change that and what if you lose the tool to open the panel?":2017-01-26:theseflowerssmelllikemeat
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition from any other Android phone:I previously had the 6Edge which I really liked. I have several friends who also have the 7, and we agree it has some definite pluses and minuses. PLUSES The camera is great! More memory and expandable capacity is awesome.  MINUSES It is difficult to use the keyboard to text, input info, etc. It seems to be slow in recognition of letters touched. It heats up quickly if used continously.:2017-01-26:Escapingmom
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone:Everything transferred from old phone easily. Some apps don't work on the new phone. Excellent camera.:2017-01-24:BTOESQ
Samsung Galaxy S7:My Review of Galaxy S-7:"I like my phone, still getting used to the new programs, however the one feature it doesn't have that I liked with my S-4 was the ""Hands free feature. On that phone I just turned the feature on. It would announce to me who was calling or texting, also would read the message back without having to turn my bluetooth on. with the S-7 all Hands free does is read the message back with blue tooth. As a safety issue the hands free was something I used all the time, very disappointed the way this is set - up.    Thank you for listening to my complaint.":2017-01-23:Lonnie Clark
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features:I like the design of the phone. It is similar to the Galaxy S5 that I previously had, so not to much learning curve. The one thing I really don't like is the battery drains quickly. I'very only had the phone just over a week, but so far looking good.:2017-01-23:2galaxys57
Samsung Galaxy S7:Smart lock feature is awesome and security features give you piece of mind.:Smart lock feature is awesome and security features give you piece of mind. Also the battery life has been really good.:2017-01-23:neya1022
Samsung Galaxy S7:Verizon Samsung S7:Phone is very nice in performance & battery life. Not particularly pleased with the 'updated apps' that the S7 installed during setup. I have not been able to get phone to behave like my S5 did - camera, talk, picture gallery. Some downloaded documents did not transfer at all. Several questions about why certain features behaved the way they did and how to chanel behaviour could not be answered by Verizon staff.:2017-01-23:Butchvan
Samsung Galaxy S7:2nd best:This Samsung 7 is not like my first Samsung 7 and I'm disappointed by it,  there were features on the first phone that's not on here.:2017-01-22:Soy bean
Samsung Galaxy S7:good phone:enjoy the new features. Easy to use. Battery life appears to be longer than previous phone. Overall a great phone.:2017-01-22:robw101
Samsung Galaxy S7:New Phone:cheaper edge 7 came with fit gear watch.  I wanted google pixel but wasn't available. After I purchased this phone got an email for 100 off same galaxy!:2017-01-22:RACH818
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxie S7:It's OK I'm not a big technology person I just need to get use to a Samsung phone it's the first one I've had:2017-01-22:1Mongo
Samsung Galaxy S7:Transparent upgrade from the Galaxy 6s:Transparent upgrade from the Galaxy 6s, faster,better camera and my Otterbein fits. Take advantage of the upgrade promo if your galaxy 5 or 6 is paid for:2017-01-21:Retired geek
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good and not so good:Love it! The only problem I have is the charge port doesn't have a cover on it like the S5 I just swapped from.:2017-01-21:hdcobb
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good Phone, Good Service:I would say the drawback is the signal strength in my neighborhood, but I will give Verizon a break on this because I am in a heavily wooded area and the signal get's a little better within a mile of home.:2017-01-21:Ptrhik
Samsung Galaxy S7:"""Feel"" could be better.":"It's a measurable improvement on the S5 in performance: faster, more memory.  The look is good also.  However, it would be easier to handle if it had a textured back and sides.  Compared to the S5, it seems too slippery.  (This may be a ""feature"" intended to promote the sale of a protective cover, but I find such covers decrease the ease of handling even more than the slippery back.)":2017-01-21:jezzwell
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice improvement from Note3.  More intuitive.:Nice switch from AT&T when I started working in a cell dead zone in rural NE.  All good and easy.  Mike:2017-01-20:chiuwuofa
Samsung Galaxy S7:Pretty Sweet Phone:It can be customized like crazy & it has a longer battery life then the Galaxy S5, but it still needs to be connected to the charger for a little bit to make it through an entire day of normal use. My sister got the black one & it looks a lot better than the gold, so I am struggling with a bit of phone envy. I'm having issues getting my contact's notifications to stick, but I think that is because Verizon Cloud is getting in the way. If you are used to a Galaxy phone, this is great; you can still navigate it well & it has quite a few additional features. My favorite thing is how you hold your finger over the home button for the finger print scanner. It accepts my prints way more than the S5 did. Also, it is so water resistant that my salesman actually rinses it in the kitchen sink with dish soap when it gets nasty. They did get rid of the floating toolbox & some of the notification sounds that my last phone had. The headphone jack is at the bottom, which I initially loved, but it is inconvenient when I want to hook it up to the AUX jack in the car & have the phone in the cradle. The accessories are great! I have a wireless charger (that I don't love) there are magnetic chargers now, along with the Gear 2Fit watch, the virtual reality helmet & it even came with an adapter that allows you to connect a flash drive or a mouse to the phone! There are tons of great phone cases for the phone as well. I was also quite concerned that the battery can't be removed, but there are ways to simulate taking a battery out to fix issues. I've only had the phone for 10 days & thankfully haven't had to test it out.:2017-01-19:LittleSqualker
Samsung Galaxy S7:Aright:Alright good OK the phones are alright. The  towers get u out there. Up north they are good.service ok:2017-01-18:Jacki 13
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great screen and battery, killer SD card slot, larger than desired:Slightly larger phone than I would prefer, but excellent battery life and a brilliant high-resolution screen.  Great that it is water-resistant; would like to have an unbreakable screen as well.  The SD card slot is fantastic, adding 200GB storage.:2017-01-18:
Samsung Galaxy S7:fast and lots of storage:phone is fast with good amount of storage. The phone is very slick so I cover is important if you do not want it to slip out of your hand. Love the wireless charging:2017-01-17:DAL1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone but speakerphone  dysfunctional.  Have to go back and exchange:Purchased  at costco loving device until  I made a couple calls on speakerphone  and the recipient  couldn't  hear. Frustrating  to say the least...:2017-01-17:Shayne2684
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great mobile phone only missing IR Blaster for remote TV control use.:Nice size for any application. Phone sound is excellent when you make calls in car and also conference calls.:2017-01-17:hopon
Samsung Galaxy S7:Like it a lot:I bought this phone because my old one broke. It's a great phone & I like it but I'm concerned every time I charge it. The part that gets pugged to my phone gets hot after 5 minutes....:2017-01-17:mrlanders
Samsung Galaxy S7:It was an easy transition from my ol:I switched services to see if will get better coverage, and it is better so far.Writing a review for a company that wants you to write over a hundred words is a bit of strech to the imagination:2017-01-16:safetydude
Samsung Galaxy S7:New Phone:I like the phone, but it seems to lose battery life quicker than it should and loads web pages somewhat slow:2017-01-16:fsu939900
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone:Upgraded from a Galaxy  S5.  Both phones seem similar.  Hope this works as well as that one has. Nice display and good sound through 3.5mm jack.:2017-01-15:Don2595
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Features, Amazing Camera and more!:The phone is strong and well built for that unfortunate drop without a case and not cracking the screen. Photo options/modes are like I have not seen on phones before.:2017-01-15:Bl83
Samsung Galaxy S7:Change from IPhone to Android:Changing from IPhone to Android is an experience.  Overall IPhone is simpler and more user-friendly.  However, after reviewing the features, I opted for an Android.  Still getting used to it.  Phone is thin and easy to hold in my smaller hand.  Great camera.:2017-01-14:DenKaye
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good Looking Phone:The S7 is much lighter than my previous phone and it feels a lot better in my hand.  The speaker is also good quality.:2017-01-14:Hijinx65
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, awesome features, amazing camera:Only have had the phone for a week and am in love with it, the only thing is it could have better battery life!:2017-01-14:Nick406
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung 7:I have had this phone a week. I do like it. I don't like my bill. Way too high. It goes up all the time.:2017-01-13:Badgolfer
Samsung Galaxy S7:Fast and responsive:My only issue with this phone is the lack of themes that are not as bright but still provide easy access and use without a bunch of colorful  garbage.  I also like the S& Edges increased size but was too worried about destroying that screen and finding a useful screen protector.:2017-01-13:timwj1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Somewhat different from Motorola but since having a Samsung tablet already not hard.:Bought the phone because the battery would not stay charged on my Motorola. Prefer Motorola but they were not available. It appears to be a good phone.:2017-01-13:paka4
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7:I bought this phone because it was the closest one to my old S4, so it has been easy to use. The size fits well in my hand or in my n pocket.:2017-01-12:nanderson922

Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice camera and quality sound:Overall, I like the phone.  I have taken nice photographs and video of my son.  Good battery life.  But I need to get more tones, because I do not like the default ring tone.:2017-01-12:jleewatts
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone:We just got these phones last week and we really like them.  Good Picture quality and nice sound.  The one downside so far is finding a good screen protector.  Since the S7 has a slight curve to the edge it is hard to find a tempered glass screen protector that fits properly.  most of the ones I have found online only have 3 to 3 1/2 stars.:2017-01-12:jmart57
Samsung Galaxy S7:2 weeks in as new customer:Pretty good. I miss the ir blaster from my s5, and battery life has dropped some after using it for a week.:2017-01-12:Hooker47
Samsung Galaxy S7:A mild step up from my Motorola Droid Turbo:My Motorola Droid Turbo has a broken screen so I upgraded rather than fixing. Processor is slightly faster and battery life is slightly less. Camera is noticeably higher quality.:2017-01-11:Chlorophyll
Samsung Galaxy S7:Attractive phone:Have only had it a week. So far I like it. I will know better in a few months. Really miss a QWERTY keyboard nstead of on screen.:2017-01-10:patiwak
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's up to you:I don't see much difference. From the s5 Only reason I changed was that my phone was unable too charge anymore. After a firmware upgrade. I truly believe it was done on purpose. Now I owe a lot, when my old phone was paid off, shame on you.:2017-01-10:Jan the man
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone. Too much junk software.:My wife and I just upgraded from our S3. Runs faster, much better battery life. Too much pressure installed bloat ware. Overall really like the new phone.:2017-01-10:Atomic punk
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7:I bought the phones 2 weeks ago, only problem is when I text # on the key pad I hit the letters too small:2017-01-10:Rassi1963
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love my phone!:Switched from Straightalk to Verizon and I love it. I had an Applei 5s and had tons of issues with tit.:2017-01-10:beanz1025
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone - some features are challenging to use:Some of the pre-configured features are annoying and am surprised at the size of the icons displayed (much larger then Razr Max).  Overall am happy with the phone and will acclimate to the changes in functionality.:2017-01-10:xxxx2017
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:I have had this phone for about a month it is a great phone with many great features the only problem I have is one I'm talking to someone else they keep telling me I soubuynd like I'm in a drum no matter where I am Intown at home whatever me and my wife have the same phone and have the same problem we call Verizon and they advised us to turn off the HD features which we did but it still sounds like we're talking out of a drum:2017-01-09:Bob and michelle
Samsung Galaxy S7:Switched from att:I bought the phone a week ago when switching to verizon. I previously had the galaxy s7 active through att, but verizon wouldn't service that phone. I like the active better.:2017-01-09:Madison4201995406
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features just takes time to get use to them.:Enjoying the features of new phone, went from an S3 to an S7, it was a leap.  However, it's easy to figure out when you take a few minutes to focus on the new items.  Great handling and screen size.  Love th enew feature that doesn't allow you to go over data cap.:2017-01-09:mich67
Samsung Galaxy S7:Signal strength:I have had a galaxy s5 and the signal strength bars on that phone were always full but on this phone I only show like 2 bars. I think they must have changed the antenna/reception on this phone. Otherwise the phone is great. If anyone else has this problem please post a review.:2017-01-09:Chas610
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone:I'm happy with the speed and the battery seems pretty good, it's still new so I'll have to see how it holds up.:2017-01-09:Pj142404
Samsung Galaxy S7:Transition was easy:Most of the features are similar to my Samsung LG. I still don't like the slight echo and static I sometimes find when I am talking on the phone. Not as much as the last one though. I believe it was because if the Otter box I had on the last phone.:2017-01-09:Organicraven
Samsung Galaxy S7:It pretty much what I expected for upgrading from an the galaxy s4.:I like android and samsung. The phone meets my expectations. The only thing that I don't like is the keypad. I understand why the change was made, but I already had a hard enough time texting with my big thumbs. My fingers are just too big for the new tiny buttons and texts never come out correctly, whether I use the swipe or traditional method. On top of that, I thought I could try using voice texting, but the button that was on the S4 keypad was not carried over and up to the S7. I really frustrates me at times. If you have any suggestions, I'd love to hear them.:2017-01-08:SeriouslyOMG
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the ease of use and new pricing, but:I do love this phone for its ease of use, especially quick connect. I have had past gen Samsung galaxies, and this was the smoothest transition.   But it still needs a longer batter life. This part downgrades a 5 star phone to only a 4.:2017-01-07:siouxbee74
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great device.:My transition from my old Galaxy is going well.The Samsung Galaxy s7 is very sleek and adaptable.THK:2017-01-07:JP67SC
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:Bought this a little over a week ago.  Still trying to learn all its featues.  Trying to tune off features and apps that i'my not interested in.:2017-01-07:Klweber52
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone!:"I actually wanted the black one, but they only had it in gold - turns out I really like the gold! LOL  Anyway, I haven't finished moving everything over from my LG yet, but so far it's perfect.  Simple to operate, and syncs fine with my bluetooth headset.  My only problem has been getting trying to upload music from itunes - still haven't figured out how to do that. :(":2017-01-06:Elcobar
Samsung Galaxy S7:Gave up my simple flip-phone for this complex S7:"My family berated me for not ""not joining the 21st Century"" for years.  I gave in and acquired the Galaxy S7 during Christmas. I am learning to use the various features and am comfortable with the basics.  I definitely wish I could delete many of the built-in apps because I have absolutely no use for them.  I resent having to constantly endure and/or discard the ""urgent updates required"" banners and pop-ups.":2017-01-06:Tupperwolf
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Apps are not preloaded:"I am a pretty loyal customer and I like to stay with what works. I really loved my S5 and I assumed the S7 would be remarkable. However, the powers that be a t Verizon decided not to preload the Samsung app/store. Very disappointing! One of the things I most appreciated about the S5 was the car mode. As soon as I connected my bluetooth (powered it up) the phone became a very usable device through my voice. It was seamless. In facr, I could not use my phone any other way that through voice commands. SO SAFE!!!! Now, I have had to dl the app and it does not work the same. In fact, everytime I engage the app I have to manually agree to the terms. Which means I have to take my eyes off of the road! BAD FORM! The app also seems a bit glitchy, where before it was REMAARKABLE!  Perhaps this is more a Samsung issue that Verizon, and make no mistake, I will share my opinion there too. :)  Thanks for listening!":2017-01-05:MoxiMom
Samsung Galaxy S7:I love Galaxy S-Anything:Some changes from S6 that are not as convenient, such as scheduling a text, but mostly easy and fun.:2017-01-05:mspalz
Samsung Galaxy S7:Everything great except for the speaker.:Excellent phone. Apps and Web pages open up fast. Battery life is OK for my medium use. My only wish is that the s7 was equipped with a stereo speakers like that of iPhone 7 which is amazing.:2017-01-05:B panda
Samsung Galaxy S7:New phone:I've had it a few weeks now and it has been an easy transition from the Motorola. I did have a S3 before the Motorola and I'm sure that helped also. So glad I changed.:2017-01-05:Kbrider
Samsung Galaxy S7:OK but home button doesn't always work:I love the galaxy phones, they are all I ever get just wish that the home button didn't stick so often:2017-01-04:Beckyk1980
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use...lots to figure out still:I traded this in for my S4 a few weeks ago. It's easy to use like the S4 but I'm a bit overwhelmed still. Lots to learn. The messaging keyword is a little tricky only in so far as the autocorrect seems very sensitive and not as clean at using an emoji keyboard. Overall I love it.:2017-01-04:Yoga4ohm
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great camera, bad phone, needs tweaking:"Screen and camera are great quality, 5 stars, use as a ""phone"" is two stars or less, I barely get a couple bars of service in my own centrally located house, and calls could hollow, echo-y and terrible, hard to make out what's being said at times. Luckily I don't use my phone much as a phone, so this only deducted one star for me.  Battery life is just ok, nowhere near as good as the phone claims to be, but the ""always on"" screen function and junky apps seem to contribute to that and can be cleaned up.   The standard apps that come on this phone (for text messaging etc) are TERRIBLE compared to my old HTC , so it took a bit of deleting and downloading to get things working to my satisfaction, but that just may be how it goes these days. Quite a bit of junk apps to ditch and settings to switch up, and the layout and organization feels counterintuitive to me and difficult to navigate, but the camera is SO good I still forgive it at 4 stars":2017-01-04:Teah
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good Phone:I recently bought this phone and it's amazing. The screen is big and I am able to watch all my shows on my phone. Also, I have lots of storage space to download all sorts of apps.:2017-01-03:Lino89
Samsung Galaxy S7:Ok:Ok. Works quite well:2017-01-03:D24656k

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great camera, not so great battery:The S7 takes beautiful pictures.  Not happy with battery life & that so many apps run in background.  Should be able to turn more things off & they should only come on when you use them.  Miss some features of my old LG G2, like the double tap on & the power button on back.:2017-01-01:smithlady
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7:Upgraded from the S3,so the S7 is awesome. My only complaint is texting. I do a lot of it,and I'm always fixing letters or spacing or spell checking words I didn't write. This is probably true on other phones,but I wish the texting technology was better.:2017-01-01:Foman

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone overall:I really wish it would just not over heat so fast.  Especially when using the VR, it takes like 20 minutes and then it's too hot.  Sometimes when watching Netflix it gets hot as well.  But overall, everything else is awesome.  Could be slightly bigger.:2017-01-01:Tyler James 22

Samsung Galaxy S7:Early Review of Galaxy S7:I am thankful for the great package Verizon provided for us as we wanted to purchase 2 smartphones.

Samsung Galaxy S7:Not a strong battery life:Just bought it a little over a week ago and the battery runs down fast.  Also it takes forever to charge:2016-12-31:Kamkam93
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery Life:I like my new phone because it is very similar to my last Samsung. One big similarity they have is that the battery life on the new phone runs down every bit as fast as the other Samsung phone. It won'the last a full day without being recharged. Other than that, it is a great phone a day easy to use.:2016-12-30:Mjorg
Samsung Galaxy S7:Same old galaxy:Not much different from the galaxy 5:2016-12-30:Ccam
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy change over.:Have had no trouble using the phone.:2016-12-30:Stamp1940
Samsung Galaxy S7:Friendly user phone:I love the camera resolutions on my S7. The only thing I'm not sure why my emails wouldn't accept images automatically from trusted senders. It also doesn't display emails by block of Dates , instead it just stack up.:2016-12-30:C_enchio

Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7:This phone is average with what I have had in the past:2016-12-29:icantfindanamethaisntused
Samsung Galaxy S7:Different Not Sure Better:I upgraded from the Galaxy S4 and am an old guy that doesn't except change well!  However, small things like the quality of voice service is much better in regards to filtering out wind and clarity is supreme.  The camera is superb in terms of exceptional pictures, great color and excellent resolution.   On the down side, change does not come easy, opening with a fingerprint is an excellent addition but changing screens and arriving at the desired phone destination is somewhat difficult for me but I am still in the learning curve.  Ask me in six months and I may be really happy or ready to throw the phone under a bus, who knows?:2016-12-29:joeyfic

Samsung Galaxy S7:Issues with phone connection:Have had an issue (as did my wife)  in placing phone calls. When I try to place a call, the call is cutoff in 1-2 seconds.

Samsung Galaxy S7:From Apple to Samsung:The features on this phone are never ending. It was a small learning curve from the iPhone but completely worth it. I would do it again in a heartbeat.

Samsung Galaxy S7:Very much like the Galaxy S5:The Galaxy S7 is very much like the Galaxy S5. I  have not seen a lot of major differences. The different ring tones and message notifications  have been very difficult to set. I also have had three different customer service representatives give me three different instructions.  I have requested an owner's manual and operating instructions and have yet to receive it. I have always been very impressed with Verizon and it's professional services. But this time I am very disappointed in the service and the lack of support in have received. I do hope that this improves greatly in the near future.:2016-12-25:Tessamae1

Samsung Galaxy S7:Easier to use:Phone is easier to use:2016-12-20:Grizfab
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's settings are easy to use and remember. Everything is easy to find.:I bought this phone almost two weeks ago. I went from having a iPhone for five years to a Samsung Galaxy. And I wish I switched years ago. The features are so so much better then the iphone. There's less updates. Better storage betting formats and my phone keeps me complete awhere of my usage and payments, news updates and applications. I feel a lot more in control and absolutely love this phone.:2016-12-20:Sarahbug

Samsung Galaxy S7:s7 does not have Find My Mobile feature:I was disappointed to learn that Samsung doesn't offer Find My Mobile feature on new phones.

He ended up transferring me to Samsung chat where I learned, after their the Samsung rep went to look it up, that the feature was no longer available.:2016-12-18:Christy RM
Samsung Galaxy S7:good phone:Very good phone; only bought it as my old phone's camera quit and I want to have something to take photos in an emergency.  Lots of features that I will never use; think it is too expensive, but guess that is the name of the game these days.  Also have not found an good case.  As I woman, I don't always have pockets to put it in, and being outdoors quite a bit makes it bulky to carry and not quick to answer.:2016-12-18:Jen13
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's a good phone:"Overall I am pleased with this phone. It replaced an older Galaxy S4 model. Other than some differences in the ""look & feel"" of certain apps the things of most note to me are: inaccessible battery, the curved screen edges. The battery is a bummer, however  ""C'est la vie"" seems to be the order of the day. The problem with the edges for me is the issue it creates with screen protectors. They either don't fit well or are made smaller then the screen to avoid the edges. Either option is undesirable. In hindsight, the S6 would've probably been a better fit for me. Once again - c'est la vie!":2016-12-18:77x7
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phones:Just started playing with my new phone and it's amazing:2016-12-17:
Samsung Galaxy S7:From a 5 to a 7 - Good Move!:I've had the S7 for about two weeks and the update was seamless due to the features of the phone.  I really like the crisp performance and the time and date display.:2016-12-17:doncov
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7:Only had it for a month, but so far, so good.  Battery performance is excellent...but time will tell as to whether it wears down over time.  Don't see much difference from my S6 in the camera function yet, as others have raved about.:2016-12-16:steph4re
Samsung Galaxy S7:Exactly what I thought it would be....:Got the phone on upgrade because my S5 was dropped. Camera was broken. Great deal at local kiosk.:2016-12-16:tylerwayneyoung
Samsung Galaxy S7:Reception Issues:I am having problems with my phone cutting out in my home. I had no issues with my S4. Not sure what is going but am not real pleased. Otherwise, I like the phone.:2016-12-16:Hunkyaz
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone!:Great phone. Very fast.:2016-12-15:Kaymib
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very fast and great camera:I got this phone a little over a week ago.  Love the improved performance over the GS5. Seem to be a couple of touch screen issues to be resolved though. May be software?:2016-12-14:Psydoc
Samsung Galaxy S7:Wish it could delete:Won't delete old address or email or phone number when contact info changes.  Becomes very confusing which is new or old #.  Other than that, I love this phone.  Have had Galaxy 4, 5 and now 7.:2016-12-14:Kathy_Kathy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy Transition from my last phone:Good phone, amazing camera:2016-12-13:hensle23
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great but software Glitch:"L over the phone but keep getting error message  ""Unfortunately calendar storage has stopped ""  occurs repeatedly and beyond annoying.":2016-12-12:Deattle
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:The cost was better than the same phone used from Swappa:2016-12-12:Karens phone
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone:Easy to use. Battery is way better than my S4:2016-12-11:JackoridingEZ
Samsung Galaxy S7:works much better than Motorola Turbo:range of wifi and bluetooth almost double ,volume real good battery a little short but I use gps a lot.:2016-12-11:Onondago
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone:I bought two months ago online. I was think Big it was going to be different than the iPhone 6 but it really wasn't. So I was a bit disappointed and wondered if I could've received a better deal and bought on iPhone 6s. I didn't want to mess with it do just kept the 7. The camera is nice and I like the slimmer phone. It's definitely an upgrade from 5c!:2016-12-10:Marmoo
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:Purchased over black friday weekend. Great phone, had the s5, so it is pretty similar. Only negative so far is that the battery life isn't much improved over s5 model (At least from what I can tell). It does seem faster and more responsive!:2016-12-10:Smokers
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great voice quality:The sound is better than my landline!:2016-12-09:jonm1030
Samsung Galaxy S7:Was very 2 operate. Transition from S4 was simple:Phone is definitely a step up from the S4. Happy so far:2016-12-08:Xtimmyedgex
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung is the best phone!:The S7 gets very hot when charging and when you use it for a long time.  The speaker   is not the best.  Overall it is a Samsung, and you know what to expect.  It is very sensitive around the edges.:2016-12-08:cwade28209
Samsung Galaxy S7:My new phone:Satisfied with my new phone only issue is the battery life. The best thing about the phone is the camera:2016-12-08:Bigceedady
Samsung Galaxy S7:Its pretty sweet:Im a little concerned there arent port covers - for waterproofing.  But Im not going to test it.   If you have liked previous versions of the Galaxy - its great.  It has very similar options and features but more streamlined and quicker.:2016-12-08:PsychedChicken
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Performance:I traded this in to replace my note 7 and I couldn't be happier. A great phone with a reliable engine. I'd tell anyone unsure which phone to get should seriously consider this device:2016-12-08:Nokidney13
Samsung Galaxy S7:was a easy transaction:very happy and excited about the endless posibilities:2016-12-08:fostest
Samsung Galaxy S7:surface too slippery.:Love samsung phones. Not an apple guy. only improvement would be a more textured outer surface to keep from dropping phone all the time.:2016-12-07:Thundergoose
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love My Phone:I am very happy with my phone, have not figured everything out and it is definitely smaller than the Note 4. I love it.:2016-12-07:MHelmick
Samsung Galaxy S7:Jury is still out:I'm happy I got a new phone, was hoping for better battery life with this smart phone from coming from an S4, hopefully the phone lasts more then 2 years before battery does completely.:2016-12-07:Bowhuntwi1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice, but lacking features of s6:It operates very smooth and is noticeably faster than it's predecessor.  Great camera, very fast download speed everywhere it's used, and I'm very happy that it doesn't have a glass back.  I like the added feature of being water resistant.  The display is crystal clear.  But it is lacking 2 features that my previous phones have had.   It does not have infrared, which worked very well on the s6.  It was a very convenient feature that I miss.   It is also lacking an fm receiver which I used a lot with my LG g3 to save data and still be able to listen to the radio.   Overall it's a very solid phone that is a pleasure to use.:2016-12-07:Mjewart
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone had to return it because of yahoo email issue:Hi,  I like the telephone but had to return the telephone since it would not allow me to use my yahoo email account for my personal and business use. I have two open tickets for the issue.:2016-12-06:Fanny229
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use and much faster:Only been a week but it's definitely a great upgrade from the old phone:2016-12-06:Tony b123
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy Transition.  Some hiccups:I like the phone.  I see no difference from my S5... except the camera is better. However, I CANNOT turn down my notification sounds from texts.  No matter how far low I drag the slider, it's LOUD.  The sound won't change.  After googling it, I'm seeing others have the same issues.:2016-12-06:Nonickname2578
Samsung Galaxy S7:Really fast and great screen...voice quality is awesome as well.:I dig this phone....worthy upgrade from my Galaxy S6:2016-12-06:KeyOfZ
Samsung Galaxy S7:Fairly smooth transition from Galaxy 4. The sound quality is quite different (can like).:We purchased a couple of these to replace the S4.  I really liked the S4 and had no issues. The S7 has totally different sound quality which is hard to get used to.  It sounds like you are talking into a tin can ... or in a small room.  They tell me it's the same for the person you are talking with as well (must be the mic and speaker).  Camera seems to be good.  Getting use to all the new features now ... seems fine.  Bought a case with a semi transparent front that protects the glass ... really like it!:2016-12-06:martra
Samsung Galaxy S7:RON'S Review of new phone & service.:So far so good. To soon to tell.:2016-12-06:Big ron
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the HD:"I got this phone about a week ago. It replaced my galaxy S4. I enjoy how my picture look with the HD. It takes some getting use to the ""buttons"".  Some features like notifications I  don't like because they don't have the same options from the other model.":2016-12-06:Nichelle56
Samsung Galaxy S7:Still Learning:Love the sound when talking to someone else.  Pics are great.  Frustrated with all the various pop-ups wanting you to purchase or upgrade to other products.:2016-12-06:tigger627
Samsung Galaxy S7:I love the way the videos calls looks.:The videos and the pictures looks much better.:2016-12-06:Susanna111

Samsung Galaxy S7:I had the S4 so it took a little getting used to. Definitely better features:Faster than the old phone. Better video graphics:2016-12-05:Shecar
Samsung Galaxy S7:Overall a Good Phone:Overall, a solid phone from Samsung.:2016-12-05:Amandap3z
Samsung Galaxy S7:Really like the always on date and time with the AMOLD display:Battery life is better than with the S5.  Especially since I use it to read the newspaper.  I took a while to get it setup to access the various apps we use.  Still trying to get the basic voicemail to work the way we want - we don't want the visual voicemail.  Like being able to add a microSD card.  We put all of our photos on it.  When we upgraded the phone we just took the photos to the new phone using the microSD card.  Hate not being able to replace the battery - thus the 4 star rating.:2016-12-05:ArizonaJon
Samsung Galaxy S7:Enjoying the S7:First time I've transferred to a new phone myself (got it mailed). Worked fine. Love the phone. S7 took a bit of an adjustment from using my S4. Found my old S4 makes a nice tiny tablet now on wifi ;):2016-12-05:ceberkel
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7:First Smart phone. Still learning:2016-12-05:Deeee2
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good upgrade from the Galaxy 5:Have only been using this for about two weeks and was able to easily adapt from using the Galaxy 5:2016-12-05:deezeei57
Samsung Galaxy S7:So far good:just purchased it so time will tell:2016-12-05:scottl843
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone, good price:the phone is very solid.  I've added a case and so far, I am pretty happy with it.:2016-12-05:pjlambert13
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not too different from my s5:Not sure if it's my service or the phone, but I notice a lot more dropped phone calls. I have rarely had this happen with my s5 and now it's dropping calls pretty regularly. Battery also doesn't last 1 day, which is disappointing.:2016-12-05:tlayers
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great!:Love the phone, love the service.  Hate the finger print ID as it is very unreliable.:2016-12-05:kimcbeck
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone:Satisfied overall. Only issue is keyboard. .should have went with the edge since it is somewhat bigger and I have big hands. Love how fast it charges.:2016-12-05:Jkuro
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, wouldn't switch to another one:So far this has been an awesome phone. The conversion from my old phone to this one was very easy. The setup was a synch. The picture on the phone is awesome. The only problem I have had is that it gets really hot even when I am not using it. I am not sure if this is normal or not. I am very satisfied with this phone and when recommend it to anyone.:2016-12-05:Jroos
Samsung Galaxy S7:Looks great.:I hope the S7 is more durable than the S5 I had previously. I have had it less than a week so far but it feels better durable.:2016-12-05:robbsurveyor
Samsung Galaxy S7:A good phone:I bought this to upgrade my s5. It works fine but is a little more confusing to figure out.:2016-12-05:Sarge57
Samsung Galaxy S7:Fast but hard to discover special features:The transition from my HTC Droid DNA has been slow. I find useful new feature by accident more than going to any kind of guide or blog. I'm not as impressed by the battery as I hoped to be; that was a key reason to upgrade at this time.:2016-12-05:Alansfl
Samsung Galaxy S7:Pretty good phone:I had a galaxy s5 for over 2 years and switched to this one about a week now. Definitely not a bad phone.:2016-12-04:Lawsona
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone:Do not buy glass screen protector. Waste of money.:2016-12-04:Shane S
Samsung Galaxy S7:So far so good:Just bought it a few days ago. Haven't had any issues yet. I think it's struggling to load images in browsers, but not sure if that's the phone or something with the software or something.:2016-12-04:Jakepor
Samsung Galaxy S7:My phone:Great phone great phone:2016-12-04:Foranch
Samsung Galaxy S7:Works well:I got this a couple weeks ago,  Wasn't going to, however my S5 died  (Like to the date) seems they give me a refurbished 5 ta start with:2016-12-04:SliverPicker
Samsung Galaxy S7:Lot of the application are not as user friendly as the older apps:Good phone  haven't had long enough to give a good review like battery life 5 times better than old phone:2016-12-04:Nicklove
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very good phone:Love the memory, pictures and large screen.:2016-12-04:JLB97
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7:Nice device the only issue I have is the battery life.:2016-12-04:Tony E
Samsung Galaxy S7:The s7 is similar to the s4:I bought this phone a week ago and it getaway the job done. There are a few differences but pretty much easy to use!:2016-12-04:rembaker
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery life suspect!:Phone seems to be doing good except for battery life. If you use the phone for surfing the Web or using apps battery dies fast. Fast charge is good for outlet charger but I have to see for car charger.:2016-12-04:Cbrew11044
Samsung Galaxy S7:"easy transition but ""do not disturb"" is slightly disturbing":"The phone works fine, the camera works fine but the ""Do Not Disturb"" feature does not turn of notifications. Calls and texts do not come through but the only way to turn off notifications is to turn off alarms. So the choice is to get email notifications all night and get the wakeup alarm in the morning or to have both silenced. Not the ideal situation while sleeping or while in a meeting. I would like a phone update to rectify this situation.":2016-12-04:AZDoodle
Samsung Galaxy S7:Was an easy transition from the s5 to the s7:I was due for an upgrade and there was a trade in promotion going on, so I decided to get the new samung galaxy and I have been very impressed with it:2016-12-04:Jess81
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7:Ok phone Very temperamental:2016-12-04:Webbama
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung7:Great phone- good service. Cloud did not transfer all my apps but was easy to re-install. I also had to transfer all my 800 pictures into albums that had been lost.:2016-12-04:Jamie V
Samsung Galaxy S7:Features:Good features of phone:2016-12-04:Uhdtjctuh
Samsung Galaxy S7:pretty cool!!:I had an S5 and upgraded, it took a little while and lots of trial to get it dialed in but otherwise I'm glad I did.:2016-12-04:williamtw
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S 7:First galaxy, always had Motorola.  Like some features and miss some of the Motorola Droid features.:2016-12-04:Edwin3438
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features:I bought this a week ago and so far so good:2016-12-04:Chromeguru
Samsung Galaxy S7:Seasoned citizen review:I bought this phone on black Friday,upgrading from the note 4. The 1st thing I noticed was how much clearer the pictures are. Then all the options for taking pictures. The next day when I finally made a phone call, wow what a difference.  100 % improvement in clarity. Charging time was also improved.  I drive a truck for a living,the same route everyday, I know where the dead spots are, I don't know if it's the phone or the service,but they are all gone. No dropped calls with verizion. I like the larger screen of the note 4. That is the only drawback, which is minor on the S7. If I had the eyes of a younger man, I would give the S7 5 stars.:2016-12-04:TruckerPete
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:Great phone overall but the call quality takes a bit to get used to.  It doesn't elaminate background noises very well and sometimes has an echo sound.  Otherwise the phone is great.:2016-12-04:Heather8514
Samsung Galaxy S7:Had to reload a few apps. Text messages gone:Keyboard a bit funky:2016-12-04:Dave n Socks
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very easy to use:I've only had my s7 for 2 weeks but I would recommend it for anything. The camera is super.:2016-12-04:Bacrocky48
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone:If you like the s5 you should like the s7:2016-12-04:Mil69kt
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7 actually downgrade from S5 in many ways - Except for speed and resolution:"Upgraded (allegedly) two S5's to S7's for my wife and I. The S7's are very fast, things open quickly. The S7 Screen is twice the resolution of S5, but seems to make many thin fonts almost unreadable, so had to change fonts in settings. Camera in S7 is way more responsive than S5, but lower resolution. Touchscreens on S7's seem to have a life of their own, miss a lot of touches, and sometimes do things before being actually touched. On screen keyboards are way more error prone than S5's, even in side by side use. I was also disappointed in the fact that the S7 does not have the Infrared port that the S5 did. I used that feature with TV/Audio remote apps and DSLR Camera remote apps, and already miss it. Kind of like when Samsung took the FM radio feature out after the S2. Last, but not least, S7's have a very small curve at the very edge of the screen that hinders use of any hard screen protectors. Overall, other than speed of processor the S5 still looks to be better in many ways, and I would give the S5 a 5-star where I give the S7 only 4.  On the touchscreen error issue, Verizon has locked out the keyboard commands that used to work on Galaxy's to get to things like touchscreen adjustments. I did find a ""touchscreen calibration"" app in Play store that has made the screen response tolerable, but still not as reliable as my S5's are.  Maybe we should wait for the S8, when Samsung gives us back the IR port, and (dare I say?) the FM radio. Oh, and the touchscreen checkbox for those of us that wear gloves. A man can dream, right?":2016-12-04:GKindred
Samsung Galaxy S7:Been a customer for a long time:Really like the new features that weren't available on my note 2.:2016-12-04:Henry6970
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone easy to use:Just got and have had know issues yet:2016-12-04:Ps lichty
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition:I've  had the phone for 1 week.   It works well and I am happy to have the extra storage options again:2016-12-04:PattiDB
Samsung Galaxy S7:So far it's great.  I've only had it a week.:Amazingly fast compared to my previous Galaxy 5.  Still learning the new features.  Battery life seems good.  I do wish it had an HDMI plug.:2016-12-04:Dennyls798
Samsung Galaxy S7:Had an s5 and upgraded:Slightly different features from s5, but I'm learning:2016-12-03:Dave and sue
Samsung Galaxy S7:So Far So Good:It's nice to be able to look up things on the go.  Changed from a basic phn.  Only a week old, but so far so good.  Charges fast like that.:2016-12-03:mln777
Samsung Galaxy S7:Mostly love:I have had the phone for just over a month and although I really do like it there are two things I'm not a huge fan of.  One, texting isn't as good because it rarely comes up with the word I swipe. Two is the rounded screen and no adequate screen protector to curve with the screen. Mine is already cracked:2016-12-03:Ajj7
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition from my other phone:Pretty good, mostly the same as the S5 I did have:2016-12-03:baridgew
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy S7:Just started using phone for one week so far it is working great:2016-12-03:Bobbyg40B
Samsung Galaxy S7:Still getting used to new phone:I just bought my phone one week ago and am still getting used to it. So far it's OK. People tell me I will come to rely on it completely, but so far, I'm not there. I'm old school, so would like a user manual to read on how to operate. I don't like reading a lot off a computer screen. I would also like to answer maybe to some of the questions on this survey and don't have that option.:2016-12-03:Duber13
Samsung Galaxy S7:The S7 is finally the phone I've wanted.:It is a quite powerful phone with great features and a very good camera.:2016-12-03:verucht
Samsung Galaxy S7:Similar to the S5:I bought this a month ago, it's pretty much the same as the s5. However, I feel like I have to press the buttons harder to get them to work. My swipe doesn't seem to work as well either. But other than that I like it.:2016-12-03:Klou79
Samsung Galaxy S7:Slow loading pages:I like the phone with the exception that it loads pages over wifi slow and seems to have some lag. I can sit with both my S7 and my old HTC in the same spot and the HTC brings up pages immediately while the Samsung S7 is still trying to load them. Quite frustrating and after testing the HTC at the same time it's obviously not my wifi.:2016-12-03:Nidoba
Samsung Galaxy S7:Only had for a week but like it:Moved from S5 to S7 - much better product:2016-12-03:DebbieNo
Samsung Galaxy S7:Fun:Fun phon experience.:2016-12-03:Mattsphone
Samsung Galaxy S7:Better than Apple:Samsung rules.....the S7 is similar to the S5, with a few more bells and whistles, but oddly enough a few less too. It seems to be lacking a few personal/custom layout options, but they're minor. My only complaint is the battery is not removable which worries me for future use and longevity.:2016-12-03:Futant216
Samsung Galaxy S7:Glad i can add memory. Seems to be a great phone:Wish this phone came in more memory such as 64gig like the s6. Moved from the s6 to this and now i have to make less of adjustments to accommodate the lack of memory:2016-12-03:Fishingmachine
Samsung Galaxy S7:How do I enjoy my new phone?:We are enjoying our phones.....not the cost, mind you because we are paying almost double what we did with AT$T......and we are still on a learning curve trying to figure out some things.:2016-12-03:Fredsj
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice Phone:I didn't give this a 5 star because it doesn't have the IR blaster feature.   Some people may not miss it but I definitely do.  The sleek design is great and fits easily in the purse.  Everything the S5 had this phone has except for the IR blaster.  Nice phone though.:2016-12-03:Romegemmar
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very similar to the S5:I updated from a Galaxy S5 to the S7.  Visually, there's not a lot of difference between the two.  There are some updated features; however, one of my most used features, the smart alarm on the clock, is no longer on this phone.  This is very disappointing as I used it every day; there's nothing worse that waking up to a blaring alarm.  I did notice that there's a feature to make the first 60 seconds louder, again why would you want this.  It would be great if Samsung would bring back this feature, maybe with an update.  Please!!:2016-12-03:Jenn T
Samsung Galaxy S7:G2 switch:I had to switch from Sprint to Verizon to activate the cell on my new G2 watch.:2016-12-02:Justaguy0814
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy s7:I love this phone and the camera but I'm not sure what is so different from the 6. Hoping to explore and find new improved stuff!:2016-12-02:asmiler
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not worth the upgrade price from Galaxy 6:I have not seen the advantage to justify the price over the Samsung Galaxy 6:2016-12-01:Grege
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good, but probably not the best:I have owned several Motorola Droid Rzr Maxx  phones which I have been satisfied with. I bought the Samsung Galaxy S7 after seeing some great reviews. It is a nice phone with several upgrades over a Rzr. I like the wireless charging. However, there are also a few things I am dissatisfied with. The battery life seems less than my Rzr Maxx. Also, the speaker is a real disappointment.:2016-12-01:Dcm3
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice cell phone.:Both this phone three week a go.need instructions booklet.:2016-11-30:Goosse
Samsung Galaxy S7:So far, so good - easy transition:Everything has been great so far. It was an easy transition from the S5 to the S7. I love the camera on the S7 it works much better.:2016-11-30:Jenn02
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy I had the GalaxyS5:I had to settle for this since there were 2 recalls on the Note 7 I had.   I loved that phone. This was 2nd choice couldn't see spending the difference on the Edge as no significant difference except size and wrap screen.:2016-11-29:Cheryl L
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great memory! Wish it could mirror screen my tv or tablet:Wish it could mirror screen with my tv or tablet:2016-11-29:Patriot Sue
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone except for reception when using as a phone.:Everything with the phone is great except the reception.  Drops calls and when talking you can only hear portions of the conversation.  Sometimes the other person on the line can only hear portions of what you say.  My wife and I both purchased the S7 and are experiencing the same thing.  This occurs in my house.  Our S4 in the house never had a problem.  We do not have a home phone so our cell phones are our only means for placing and receiving calls.  Plus I work from home and the only way my employer can talk to me is by my cell phone.  We haven't traveled since purchasing the S7 so I can not say for sure if this occurs any where else.  I did activate the phone so that we can receive and place calls through WIFI.  That seems to have help.:2016-11-28:mphillipsaz

Samsung Galaxy S7:New phones:Had the phones a week and all is working on well. Good battery life and nice sound.:2016-11-27:Gr8life
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone but don't buy the glass protective cover:"I recently purchased this phone and was talked into a ""bundle deal"" including a case, car charger, and glass screen protector. The screen protector does NOT fit this phone. It doesn't adhere the the phone like it should. I was lightly sliding my finger along the side that was lifting because I could see an air bubble underneath and the screen protector cracked!! Surprisingly, the screen protector has a lifetime warranty. I'm already going to have to use the warranty and I haven't had the phone more than two weeks.":2016-11-27:lmr59

Samsung Galaxy S7:Getting better:I have had it for about a week and am getting the hang of it.  I switched from a windows phone and it's a little different. But the more I get used to it the better I like it. The sound is better than my windows phone and the camera is great.:2016-11-24:Poopoobunny

Samsung Galaxy S7:9379649867:Brought a week ago. Still learning how it works.:2016-11-21:JLHF
Samsung Galaxy S7:I like it a lot!:got this phone a little over a week ago. I do like it a lot, except that it doesn't stay charged very long.....5 to 6 hours at the most. I turned on power save and it made no difference. The only thing I use my phone for is calls and text messages and I don't get a lot of those.:2016-11-21:Ladylee191
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy7:Great phone like it more then the apple I phone  wish the guy that gave us service at Verizon would of showed us how to use the phone a little had to figure some of it out on our own:2016-11-20:HellRazor1999
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone with minor flaws:The s7 has performed to my expectations thus far. The only detractors to this phone are as follows. The battery could use increased capacity. And it's dang near impossible to find a screen protector that covers the whole screen and doesn't pull away from the edges:2016-11-20:Loki628
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone is fine, but having trouble updating my information:The phone seems to be just fine. Several nice upgrades. However, I am having trouble linking the phone to verizon's cloud. I am also having trouble getting the phone to link with my Outlook programs. Specifically Hotmail, Contacts and Calendar:2016-11-19:TheNickNamesIwantAreUsed
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nifty!:Had to replace Galaxy3.  Like the similarity of formats but CONTACTS is difficult to use.:2016-11-19:vannancy

Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice size, good features:Upgraded a week ago and like ease of use, speed, storage.:2016-11-16:GoldenMINERVA
Samsung Galaxy S7:Quality phone, I have had Samsung in past with no issues.:I bought this phone because my LG G3 died the month it was paid-off (two years).  (Thought it was battery way it quit.  But tried replacement and phone just had froze and died.)  Didn't have a choice, needed a replacement cellphone and got what CNET had best review on.  I like the home screen button, not so impressed with camera.:2016-11-16:DJ_Baar
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone:"Got it for my wife as an upgrade from S5. She loves it. Happy wife... Happy :-))))":2016-11-15:Mamadou
Samsung Galaxy S7:Still getting use to it:"A lot to learn for a first-time smart phone! But I wanted ""the best"".      :)":2016-11-15:HatesATT
Samsung Galaxy S7:upgrade from my previous phone:to be honest I have not activated it.:2016-11-14:cinimm399
Samsung Galaxy S7:New phone:I understand upgrades but why change the simplest things. You have to relearn your own phone and I find it a pain in the butt.:2016-11-12:Loriwilks
Samsung Galaxy S7:Screen protector:The screen protector is a terrible fit.  It does not reach out to the edges of the phone and it blocks a clear view along all edges, top, bottom, and sides. I'm very disappointed with this feature for such an expensive, upgraded phone.  Come on Samsung!!:2016-11-11:mrgikay
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone overall:On my S4,I could write into an app, then either e-mail, text, or messenger it to people. The S7 does not allow me to use this function with messenger anymore. Other than that, it is a clear upgrade over my old phone:2016-11-10:The Rev J
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great transition from iPhone!!!:I had an iPhone for 4 years, and decided to try out android. The galaxy s7 was anice excellent choice! I love this phone!!!:2016-11-10:mriegle09
Samsung Galaxy S7:Some getting used to and sensitive to the touch but a good phone.:"I have had the phone for a couple of weeks and it takes a bit of getting used to but it works well. The screen is a bit sensitive to the touch but there are some nice easy features once you learn them. ""Ok Google"" is a great feature.":2016-11-10:careful4u
Samsung Galaxy S7:Was an easy transition:I am loving my phone so far and still exploring all the new features:2016-11-10:Amberlina
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's OK:The phone is OK but so far nothing special than what you would expect for the money.:2016-11-09:Garyfd
Samsung Galaxy S7:overall great!:Works great ... still learning features.:2016-11-09:nflink1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Lovey Samsung:Happy with my Samsung S7:2016-11-08:TO2002
Samsung Galaxy S7:Difficult transition  and lack of support:seems ok so far  not sure that it is much better than my old S4 except for the camera:2016-11-08:tj 4406
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone.:Great phone. However it drops my calls frequently. My galaxy 4 never did. Living same place. Also do not like that the speaker is in the bottom of the phone.. otherwise a great phone..:2016-11-07:Shekina
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung:Got the phone for my wife and she loving it..:2016-11-06:Savaga2g6
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very nice features:"After thinking it for a while, I decided to buy this phone, I come form a long line of Blackberries and I still like them but it was getting too difficult to get some apps. This Galaxy s7 it is very nice looking, and screen is very clear and bright, easy to use, lots of settings options. It comes a little too ""Bloated "" for my taste but I will figure out the way to delete everything that I don't use. I don't like all the automatic updates but I think I can probably set it up, it is updating on things that I will never use and I don't even see the app, I'm just concerned that it will use a lot of data with updates that I don't need or use. Charging time is freaky fast and battery life is good, not excellent. Music player is good but the sound through the little speaker, sucks (Compared to my last BB Z30) Camera is very nice with lots of options , very clear pictures. I really the voice command feature is very sensitive and I don't have to talk to it like a robot. I speak normally and it recognizes every single word Phone calls are excellent, very clear sound and excellent volume, I actually have the volume set at around 50% and I can hear veeeeeeeery good, that for me is a plus. I would recommend to buy a protector, I can see how easy would slip off your hands, I bought a UAG case and it looks amazing (Pricey) Like I said , I only have for a few days and I'm still trying to play with settings. We will see.":2016-11-04:vidaldm318
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very nice:This is a great phone, easy to use, more capabilities than imaginable:2016-11-04:Nana229
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7:Nice. Similar to my S4. Brighter colors but....... be very careful with it until you get a cover for it. It's VERY slippery.:2016-11-04:Prelude
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy 7:Had it about two weeks.  I like the nice bright screen.  Emails load better than my earlier Galaxy.:2016-11-03:Bob6
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the water resistant, wish for longer battery life.:Nice features, the battery life isn't as long as I would prefer. Very nice styling and love the water resistant feature. Easy to use.:2016-11-03:Nanabirchleaves
Samsung Galaxy S7:New phone:Not happy!  I gently set my brand new phone on my desk (had less than 24 hours) and it spider cracked on the back.  The retailer wouldn't replace without insurance.  I was blamed for a manufacturer defect.  I have worked in glass in my career and this spider crack was clearly the result of a defect.  Samsung customer support was bad!  Other than the above issues it is a good phone.:2016-11-03:Buckeye80
Samsung Galaxy S7:I Was Happy with the S4:"You'd think it would be easy to just go up a few levels---HA!!! My pictures are all over the place, taken out of their previous albums (thanks Google), there's a ""known"" and annoying flaw in the Samsung keyboard if you don't use Gmail, the S7 is a tiny bit bigger than the S4, requiring a new case. And I've only had this for a week---- who knows what other issues will come up. If I could have exoandrd memory in S4, would have been happy to keep it.":2016-11-02:Jarr
Samsung Galaxy S7:Happy with my new Galaxy 7!:I bought this a few weeks ago and it's not grade from the Galaxy 5. I like it a lot but I wish it had even more internal memory on it because after moving all my stuff over it took up a lot of the memory already. It also feels hot when I use it for more than 10-15 minutes, which makes me worry about the battery.:2016-11-02:Djcc
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not as good as my S5:I've had it a month and frequently put calls on mute because of the location of the mute  symbol. That's really all I don't like. Battery life not as good as the S5.:2016-11-02:Nitewalk
Samsung Galaxy S7:A little smaller than i would like.   Having to get use to where the buttons are.:I switched from LG4 back to Samsung.   Better quality product.   LG died after 1 year.:2016-11-01:Sharlene7
Samsung Galaxy S7:So far, so good!:Very happy.  The Smart Switch feature was AWESOME!:2016-10-31:Fuzz2318
Samsung Galaxy S7:Signal strength weak:The only problem I am having with my new Galaxy S7 is that the signal strength is sooo much weaker than my old Galaxy S4 and is slower to perform tasks. FB videos rarely play, even at 4 bars!  PLEASE FIX. Thank you.:2016-10-31:Ms Vee
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7 not all that:This phone doesn't do a lot of things my Droid did, or at least not as easily. The s-voice is not as intuitive. Cannot find a way to have the phone read text messages aloud when I am driving like my Droid did. Phone is fast, the camera is terrific, and I like the way voice-mail shows up but the phone  doesn't  allow people to be put on home screen for quick  access. The many phone personizattuon features provide lots of unusual options for specific situations that could be helpful.:2016-10-31:Dreamweaver58
Samsung Galaxy S7:Keyboard not great:Love the Galaxy phones but this new S7 keyboard can't keep up with my typing.  Never had this problem with my S5.:2016-10-30:Paxysmom
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's okay.:Better than the Galaxy 4 tab I had. But it still freezes up.:2016-10-30:Tired of  survey requests
Samsung Galaxy S7:Same as the galaxy 5. Still playing around with it.:I'm still learning the phone, but look and design are better. The Samsung keyboard is better, though I still prefer SwiftKey. Love the speedy charge on a regular micro USB.:2016-10-29:Patarang
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone:Good phone ..fast and reliable:2016-10-28:Alineal
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great screen.:I bought this phone along with one for my father. It's been easy to use making it easy to help my father with understanding how to use it.:2016-10-28:Robo87
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features, fast, awesome camera.:I bought this less than 2 weeks ago, I couldn't be happier. My only issue is I had to factory reset today from using the fingerprint security, not using a digital code as well and restarting my phone locked me out.:2016-10-27:Adamo12
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone just wish I had the note 7 back:Honestly there isn't anything wrong with the phone itself. It is kinda small for my taste, but I am so used to having the note phones so this is considerably smaller in that case. Overall a great phone, just wish I had the chance to have the note 7 without risking anything.:2016-10-27:Noosman
Samsung Galaxy S7:Some transition difficulties, but getting better.:Would like to see a more detailed manual to explain how to use features.:2016-10-26:Frush
Samsung Galaxy S7:"Downgraded from the Note 7 :(":This phone is fine, works great, great features, etc. However, I had a Note 7 and had to give it up because of the recall. I lived the Note 7 and this phone feels mini after having it. Other than the small feel, it's fine.:2016-10-26:Mdnoon29
Samsung Galaxy S7:Pretty easy.:Pretty easy transition, just need to have all passwords logged before giving up old phone for trade in.  Phone still jams up a little  bit.:2016-10-26:Debbie Galaxy  S7
Samsung Galaxy S7:New phone always a work in progress:Bought this phone to replace S5 hoping there wouldn't be much difference.  Not having too much trouble adapting.:2016-10-26:Kring
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung S7:Bought this a week ago and absolutely love it:2016-10-26:Rogers6740
Samsung Galaxy S7:Continuing with Galaxy:My S6 went down to the bottom at a reef...so I upgraded tot he S7.   Generally, it is about the same experience after about 6 or 7 hours to restore everything and re-load apps.   I think the battery is better and like the fact that I can expand the memory and particularly that it is again waterproof, like the S5. I read that the S7 had a better camera, but that I don't understand.  It is a significant reduction in pixels, but also is a 4x3 standard aspect ratio - vs. the wide screen version on the S6 and S5.   I would rather have my old camera back.:2016-10-26:jdcenfl
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it:I love my new Galaxy S7; however, there is one problem I have with it. I can't download my contacts via Bluetooth with my new Subaru Forester. I tried it with my Galaxy S5 and it worked fine. Anyone else have this problem?:2016-10-26:TammyGenne
Samsung Galaxy S7:easy to use:easy transition from my samsung3:2016-10-26:Ron123
Samsung Galaxy S7:Review by an Old Man:I'm not really an old man, but I use technology like one. Basically, my consumer strategy was to get a phone from the newest generation of Apple's best competitor. So far, after a month or so, I've noticed the Swype function is not as intuitive as my last phone and, while it charges quickly, the battery does not last very long, even with the few apps I use on it. These problems are small to me; overall, I am very satisfied with the ease of handling and the structure.:2016-10-26:waiboi
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features and easy transition:After having my Galaxy Note 7 recalled twice, this is just as good as the Note 7 except for the battery charge life. It is not as good, running the same apps, as the Note 7 battery but, a lot better than my original G4 for sure. The screen and camera are sufficient for my needs and the sound quality is excellent.:2016-10-24:BZone
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone is great!:I just transitioned from the S5 to the S7 and love many of its features. My only negative is the keys aren't very sensitive, but otherwise, I love the phone.:2016-10-24:Sportgirl
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone, but doesn't live up to hype:Just got the new phone, was told that the battery would last much longer and the new wireless charger would fast charge. Have found neither to be true in fact it's not any better than my S5 was. It is a nice phone, and I'm not unhappy, just disappointed that I didn't see any huge change from the S5 to S7.:2016-10-23:Lynda23
Samsung Galaxy S7:Was NOT an easy transition from previous phone. Too many changes.:"I don't like the keyboard changes. You get used to having the ! on the D key and now it is on the X key and other changes like that. Couldn't leave well enough alone. There are a few other issues, but with time I am sure I'll figure it out. Or if I were a ""techie nerd"" it probably wouldn't be an issue at all":2016-10-22:Mole lady
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition from the S5 to the S7.:Love the S7. Easy transition from S5 to the S7. Love the new Phone.:2016-10-22:Mayf3333
Samsung Galaxy S7:I miss my Note:The Galaxy 7 is a good phone but he Note series is so much better.:2016-10-22:Sharkman1959
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good product:Good all around products:2016-10-22:Big Reggie 44
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone, but Verizon removed Find My Mobile feature:I love the phone, in my opinion it is the best phone out there for my purposes.  The phone itself gets 5 stars.  But my biggest dislike is that it Verizon removed the Samsung app Find My Mobile.  Apparently Samsung still includes it with the phone, but Verizon removed it when they tweak the software for their phones.  Not the end of the world though, there are other apps out there that do similar, I just haven't found one yet that is as much to my liking.:2016-10-22:Dexter the Dog
Samsung Galaxy S7:Replacement for Note 7:Although I miss my Note 7 very much, the Samsung Galaxy 7 was the best replacement I could have chosen.  More or less identical features and nice added feature of waterproof!:2016-10-22:Dinarella
Samsung Galaxy S7:Pretty good:Its nice, some improvements from the s5, which was my last phone.  I don't know if it's the protective glass on the screen but the touch screen seems slightly off which slows swiping and texting in an annoying way.:2016-10-22:JRT76
Samsung Galaxy S7:My review:Switched from I phone 6.:2016-10-21:Dlo25
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very fast, some glitches:I've only had it a couple weeks and it's mostly great. The touch screen is calibrated differently than what I am used to, and the screen sometimes blacks out in the middle of short videos and tasks, but the OS is lightning fast and the camera is brilliant. We'll see how it wears.:2016-10-21:Quinzy
Samsung Galaxy S7:"It's not the Note 7 :(":I bought the Note 7 and loved the size, features and performance.  I am sad that there is nothing comparable to it presently on the market.  The 7 is okay, but honestly, besides the split screen and longer battery life at the moment, I don't see much difference in the 7 from my Galaxy 5.:2016-10-20:Really wanted the Note 7
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good:Phone was great when I first got it, then after about 2 weeks the screen would freeze up every now and again while I was doing something on it.:2016-10-20:elkkk
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone but...:I am one of the one that had originally upgraded to the note 7 and in comparison this phone lacks. I am a Samsung fan and will be for some time but I want my Note back. The battery life is not as good as that of the Note 7:2016-10-20:Tom Lombardo
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very nice phone, good features, & easy transition:I've had this phone about a week and love it so far.  Camera is awesome.  Definitely make sure you get a good case because it is much more slippery compared to my last Samsung. I went 4 days without a case & I was constantly catching it as it slipped away.  It's awesome now that I have a good case.:2016-10-19:lbehler
Samsung Galaxy S7:Sharp learning curve, this is my first smartphone.:"The phone has so many features that I am a bit overwhelmed since it's my first smartphone, even on its ""easy mode"".  A simple laminated card to get started on the most basic functions would be helpful.":2016-10-19:piano lady
Samsung Galaxy S7:Like new features and better voice/sound quality:I have had the phone for a week. Light years  ahead of the phone I had before.:2016-10-19:Janetdweezildh
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the profile and the battery life.  So far so good:I had an S5 and it was about 3 years old.  It died last week.  I am very pleased with my new S7, especially the new USB charging and the wireless charger I purchased.  It was very easy to get set up using my cloud backup.  So far no complaints except with the new clock app.  I don't like it as much as I did the old one I had.  I also have an issue with preloaded games.  I don't need them and don't want them, why do they take up space on my phone.:2016-10-19:phill025
Samsung Galaxy S7:The storage is great and battery lasts longer than previous phone.:The transition from S5 to S7 was a little difficult.  I really miss being able to add words to the dictionary.  This phone does not anticipate my words like the S5 did.  I like the addition of a flashlight.:2016-10-18:Martha08
Samsung Galaxy S7:New S7 so happy I got this phone:I did not want to trade in my s5 because I really liked that phone, but it was time. I'm happy with everything except fast charge isn't as fast as the s5. And the battery life not quite as long.:2016-10-18:Aaw9981
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:I'm happy with my phone sometime the reception isn't  good:2016-10-18:Rostopaz63
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone! Switched from S6 to S7!:I had to upgrade because I fell in a creek. Other than loosing the Samsung Apps and the Peel Smart Remote and the Music Player that was internal to the phone, I also wanted a white phone not the gold. So I went with black as I hated the gold.:2016-10-18:jriley
Samsung Galaxy S7:quickly learning how to use:have it over 2 weeks and leaning the uniqueness:2016-10-18:myphone1234567890
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great pictures:I had to switch carriers got approved right away, and love new phones sometimes doesn't get service in certain areas:2016-10-18:Allenlynn659
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone:Basic android workability.  Battery life is good. Sounds good and is intuitive.:2016-10-18:Brutalmind
Samsung Galaxy S7:I jumped the apple ship:"So, I've had the Galaxy 7 about 2 weeks and I do really enjoy it but there's definitely some features that are different from the iPhones that have had in the past that I do miss. Specifically there are some apps that I used a lot in my work that are not available with Android phones or the equivalent is not as good. Additionally it's a little bit more cumbersome with the different apps. Apple has everything working seamlessly but none apple phones are a bit piecemeal. So you kind of have to pick between going all Samsung apps versus all Google apps versus Verizon apps.  if you ve had iPhones it can be a bit frustrating because none of them communicate with each other well. it seems to take me more steps to do things then my iPhone did.   However the storage is amazing on this, the pictures and videos are just unreal, the selfie function/timer is nice....and other things i can't think of right now.  I was really getting annoyed with the apple isms like being forced to update, or ""challenged"" (as the oh so intelligent apple genius told me) use cloud storage (aka pay for it). all in all, a phone is a phone. I can't say it's earth shattering, there are things I really like that are different and things I miss.":2016-10-18:rbrown2438
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition from my Galaxy5:I like the phone as this is my 3rd Samsung.  What I didn't like was all the spam that was somehow loaded on the phone.  It may have been something I did or it may have been on at activation, but it was extremely annoying and unwanted. I have yet to use the camera which I was told is much better than the cameras on previous Galaxy phones.  I'm not real keen on the payment plan that they now use for upgrades, however, because of the changes they are making to usage and per phone charges, I'm actually paying less monthly.  Good thing because if it wasn't a good deal, I would not have upgraded and may have moved my service...:2016-10-17:ddebweb
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone, love the 'always on' feature:I bought this after having a Note 5 so I have had to get used to having a smaller screen, but the one thing that has bothered me the most, is the smaller keyboard.  And, I don't have the 'Swype' keyboard option so it doesn't seem to pick up my swypes as well.  But overall, I like the phone.  I had hoped the battery would last longer, but I still have to charge it every day, and I really only use it for phone and texting and both very minimally.  I do miss having a stylus but I definitely didn't want a Note 7 after the problems they've had.:2016-10-17:aspeagle
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy s7:Easy transition and intuitive. I like the camera.:2016-10-16:mrdougie
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung S7:I bought the galaxy s7 two weeks ago and so far it has been great. I had the s6 and this is definitely a nice upgrade. My only concern is that the video sent to a different phone comes out pixelated and blurry. I am not sure why.:2016-10-16:devildogkennyg
Samsung Galaxy S7:New Phone:Much better than my really old LG:2016-10-16:EastTennis
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7:I have gotten the note 7, but unfortunately it was recall. So next option was the s7.:2016-10-15:Baldo78
Samsung Galaxy S7:Another great Samsung phone:Before this phone, I had the Note 3 and was very happy with it. This is a similar phone but faster. I'm enjoying it so far, but I just have to get used to smaller everything.:2016-10-15:ips4bs
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it - Easy transition from my Motorola Droid:I've had the phone a couple of weeks and it is an improvement over my previous phone - which I loved and waited several months beyond the contract expiration to trade up.:2016-10-15:tennis92117
Samsung Galaxy S7:easy switch.:used to be it was a real pain to switch info from old phone to the new one,but if you were using a android before, it takes a couple of min  to do, very easy set up, like everyone else, wish the battery was better, but I can get a little over a day with it, and it charges a lot faster then the older Samsung or h.t.c. phones. sound is not as good as the h.t.c. but is good enough.:2016-10-15:hagar646
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone Review:I dropped a TV on my old phone and had to get a replacement.  I wish these phones would be the same size so otter boxes could be interchangeable. Samsung must have stock in Otter Box. I also wish the backs had a grippier surface - too slippery. I also wish Verizon would let me decide which apps I want - NFL, etc. updates alone eat my data without my permission.  I have my phone on Power Save, but that does not seem to stop it eating data without my permission.:2016-10-15:NOhearmenow
Samsung Galaxy S7:Mostly easy to use:Keeps losing my contacts:2016-10-13:Karenhaase3
Samsung Galaxy S7:Plain:Not much to this  phone it's what you see and it's what you get, no bells or whistles:2016-10-13:Chocolategal
Samsung Galaxy S7:Would be a better phone if Verizon didn't screw with it:Had the exact same phone with sprint. WiFi calling worked better. Verizon throws on a TON of bloat ware. In general, Verizon handicaps this phone.:2016-10-13:Rich98765
Samsung Galaxy S7:❤❤❤ it:Just wish I could figure out where the missed call alert is hiding!:2016-10-13:CHGOHWK
Samsung Galaxy S7:Grest phone:Had my S4 Mini for three years but can’t find healthy batteries for it (can only find dry cells manufactured three years ago).  S7 is a great phone but it is too expensive and too big.   Not a pocket phone.:2016-10-12:NickS4mini
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great camera, very fast:I bought the Samsung galaxy s7 about a week ago. I have had no problems, works great can't wait to see how well it works after months of use.:2016-10-12:Bonnie007
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's crisper and looks better.:For me it gets too hot still when charging and when I'm on the phone. This worries me. The charge does not stay much longer than the Galaxy 4 that I traded in and that is even when the Galaxy 4 was already giving me troubles. Not sure if I got a bad battery in the phone or if this is just how it's made. Other than these issues all I can say is it's a phone and I use it. I'm not a gadget enthusiast so I it may take a lot to impress me. Just the facts folks.:2016-10-12:CYG1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great upgrade from Samsung Galaxy S5:I bought this to replace my Samsung Galaxy S5. I like the functionality of the Samsung and the camera takes excellent pictures. My disappointment is that I had to replace the first S7 within a week as it was defective. It kept restarting, even when I was in the middle of a phone call. There, also, is an app on the phone that was included but is no longer supported by Samsung and cannot be removed (Samsung Milk Music).:2016-10-12:Plziggy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Switched from iPhone to Samsung:Overall there isn't a lot of difference. The functionality that Google offers with the apps will be really good once I'm able to get used to it. Overall, the phone is good and has been user friendly, especially since I switched from iPhone. One thing that annoys me about the phone is that the screen is too sensitive along the edges; it opens apps, etc. just from me picking up my phone. Other than that, I don't mind the switch.:2016-10-12:KP406
Samsung Galaxy S7:Still learning!:Print on phone is easier to read than previous model. Also like that phone is thinner and not as heavy.:2016-10-11:Marjie B
Samsung Galaxy S7:Significant Improvement Over Galaxy S4 Mini:I've only had the phone for two weeks now, so I'm still adjusting to it.  Even though it's larger than the Galaxy S4 Mini that it has replaced, it still fits comfortably in my hand.  However, I do wish that the phones could be smaller to fit more easily into my pockets.  The screen is much sharper than the S4 Mini, and it holds a charge much longer.  I added the flexible glass screen protector, and so far it is very easy to navigate.:2016-10-11:Pittsburgh Slim
Samsung Galaxy S7:Almost 5 stars...:I've had my phone for a little over a week & I really like it. I like all the features & how much you can customize everything. The only thing I have an issue with is the battery. It doesn't last as long as I'm used to with my old HTC phone. It's great having a super fast charger but I feel like I'm charging it a lot for a new phone. Back to the things I like... I really like the size of the phone. It's not too big & it fits nicely in my hand. It's very fast. I find that I don't have to wait for anything I click on which is especially nice when it comes to the camera & the gallery. I love how fast both apps open. I also like how fast you can transition to the gallery from the camera after taking a picture. Another thing I find super helpful is having the ability to share directly from the screen after taking a screenshot. I use this feature a lot. I like being able to delete screenshots from the notification bar as well. I was very happy to see such a wide variety of options and features available for me to look at, edit, change & customize in the settings application. I went through each topic,  made sure I fully understood it & made the phone my own. I really like the thumb print access, too. Overall the phone has exceeded my expectations. The only thing I have a problem with is battery life which is unfortunate because that's kind of a big deal. Besides that the phone is exactly what I needed & wanted. I was an HTC customer, only owning HTC phones since I first owned a smartphone, but I took a gamble & got my Samsung Galaxy S7. Fortunately this is a decision I do not regret. Im glad I have made the switch because this is really a great phone & I'm much happier with it than I thought I would be. I didn't expect to love it so much!:2016-10-11:Maldrich487
Samsung Galaxy S7:Haven't had the phone long enough to evaluate:Have only had the phone a week:2016-10-11:Norton1960
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great decision!:I was hesitant to go for such a upgrade. But I can't imagine any othere phone. It's snagging:2016-10-11:Jenjen357
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7 good but battery life to be desired.:We've had the S5 and S6 and now the S7. Like that the S7 is water resistant and has great screen. However, the phone doesn't make it through the day on full charge more often than I would like. It is frustrating to have a phone die when away from home.:2016-10-10:mtngant
Samsung Galaxy S7:Glad to have 32G of memory and long use battery:Desperate move paid off:2016-10-10:Stanman47
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice Size, Nice Sound,.... Not an easy transition from iPhone:Its a nice looking phone but its confusing trying to figure out how to do simple stuff like download a ringtone.:2016-10-10:StinaBina
Samsung Galaxy S7:samsung galaxy s7:I brought this phone a week or  2 ago and I like it but is disappointed because I thought the fitbit watch came free with it like other carriers.  Oh well, I will make sure next time:2016-10-10:Msnene
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition from my HTC which was having all sorts of problems:Had to buy a phone without much research but this one seems great. Vibrant clear screen, intuitive to use and much like my old phone so the switch was easy:2016-10-10:lynnom
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice upgrade:I've only had this phone a week but I really like it so far. The picture is so clear and bright, the camera is great, and it's very fast. So far my only criticism is the sound on calls. On both ends the sound seems like it had an echo to it:2016-10-09:MrsSonsauce
Samsung Galaxy S7:My New Galaxy S7 first week.:Great size! Easy to use! It takes great photos!:2016-10-08:lorac63
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very Interesting!:I bought this phone a week ago. The salesperson was very helpful. There was or is a few glitches such as the installed weather app. Definitely don't like it. Tried to download  and install several weather apps that stopped working or won't  work on my phone. Accuweather not good. Don't  like the Google search bar. I would like  more customizable  choices in color or transparent!:2016-10-08:Dena437
Samsung Galaxy S7:S4 to S7 move:Overall quite satisfied.  Nice to have the extra memory.  Still have not been able to configure wireless to default on startup/wakeup.  Uses data to connect.  Have to manually tell it to use wireless.:2016-10-08:chickLittle
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good Phone:Fast and easy to use, but uses up battery charge quickly.:2016-10-08:studerguy
Samsung Galaxy S7:great:greatphone really like it:2016-10-08:Sarah89
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great upgrade from S5, but keyboard not as nice.:Love the phone and features, glad I upgraded.  However, the keyboard isn't as sensitive as the S5, and I've noticed while typing it will miss letters and spaces.  Very annoying... hopefully there is a fix, and I haven't found it yet.:2016-10-07:nordicloki
Samsung Galaxy S7:4 star:I bought this a week ago and am really enjoying it.:2016-10-07:Minnie66
Samsung Galaxy S7:Smooth and easy to use:Like the features and larger screen. Still haven't been able to move my gallery over from my old phone.:2016-10-06:trammm4154
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung S7:have only had the phone for a few weeks but is works great and has not exploded as yet.:2016-10-06:Lima2
Samsung Galaxy S7:What you expect:All in all good phone, I just think that the ports (usb and headphone jacks) are ill placed at the bottom of the phone making it awkward to use while plugged in and impossible to sit vertically. Also having the speaker there is bad, I keep covering it with my hand or finger. Having the power button almost directly across from the volume buttons poor design as well, I accidentally turn my phone off when trying to turn the volume down.:2016-10-06:Doldra
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very good phone.:I got this a few weeks ago.  Phone has performed very well.  Had a little trouble setting up email but once done has worked well.:2016-10-06:Kcm49
Samsung Galaxy S7:Updated Features without Too Much Change:I had the S5 for about 2 and a half years previous to my S7. After certain features were starting to not work, I knew I needed a new phone and knew I wanted to stick with Samsung. The Note and Edge both are amazing phones, from brief usage in the store and seeing the new features in ads. After testing them out in the store, I came to the conclusion I wanted to stick to the regular S7. It's a perfect size for me and about the same size as my S5. I personally am not a huge fan of big phones as I dislike have large or bulky things in my pockets.   Anyway, the S7 after now using it for 2 weeks, is great. I really like the updates to the operating system and hardware but most importantly how much it is like the S5. Menus, system applications, and customization are almost exactly like the S5. It's not that I don't like change when getting new electronics but it made operating my new phone much easier. I didn't have that week of learning new menus, keystrokes, or paths. It was simple and straightforward.:2016-10-06:balkyreek
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7:I love Samsung  products... very  happy:2016-10-05:Eve31
Samsung Galaxy S7:Mostly seamless but gets hot quick:After all of the Samsung Notes catching fire, I was worried when my phone got so hot I could not hold it many times while updating and installing apps. Has not been that hot since. Overall faster phone.:2016-10-05:Tallguyryan
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7:Overall great phone, certain apps do not work the same as the s4:2016-10-05:Jak1234
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features horrible battery:Awesome phone as with all galaxy series phones but the battery life on this phone sucks. I get maybe 12 hours for use and ended up buying a mophie battery pack:2016-10-04:Kt2016
Samsung Galaxy S7:just like my s6:works well. good camera quality:2016-10-04:kzilk
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:Great phone, I like all the features, however, I gave 4 stars because of the sound quality, no matter how much I change the quality of the sound on the setup, still it is not a good one.:2016-10-04:Serpouhi
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good Phone.:This is a good phone. I have not had a chance to really do anything with it yet, but it hasn't exploded yet so that's a plus... wish I would have gotten the black one... rose gold get me laughed at and beat up by the other sales engineers I work with but that's ok.:2016-10-03:Monotoneappsspecialist
Samsung Galaxy S7:Better Battery, better flow:I like it for the most part - its up swing from the 6 but I would say its not as big as I expected. The biggest part is the extendable memory and better battery life.  What is not so good is the battery as in the 6 gets hot. Considering the issues with the Note7 that is concerning.:2016-10-03:kinger12
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy s7:Phone has good features.  Battery life is not exactly what I expected from a new phone.:2016-10-03:algolds305m
Samsung Galaxy S7:I am still having issues understanding this phone but I like it better than my last one:I have only had this phone not even a month still learning about it.:2016-10-02:qcgal
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy S7:I had the phone about a week now. The look and feel of the phone is really good, camera quality is good. I'm new to andriod and getting apps is no problem.:2016-10-02:Mrwade
Samsung Galaxy S7:Planned obsolesence:I had to upgrade because of software conflicts making my 2.5 year-old S-4 mini partially useless.  The S-7 is good, but it's bigger and I really didn't want to spend the money on it.:2016-10-01:SL84
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, needs better software:The phone is fast, has a much better feel than previous Galaxy phones.  Buttons a crisp feel.  My only complaint, and I don't know if it's due to the lack of programming from Samsung or Google is the fact that you cannot set which WiFi spots to automatically connect to.  It's pretty much all or none.  I would like to just connect to specific spots like work and home automatically and not every WiFi my phone encounters, because when it's a weak signal it turns your phone into a useless brick while using tons of battery power trying to connect  until you turn the WiFi off.  I would have held out for the new Pixel phones if Google hadn't choked with those having only an IP53 rating!:2016-10-01:scot1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:Very easy to use having owned an S4 prior to this. Lots of great improvements,  but also a few things that i dont like. Its not as easy to move pictures between the device and the SD card. I eventually figured it out, but on the S4 it was very easy. The Messaging app doesnt let you customize at all. And i dont like that there is no longer a menu key like the older phones had. Everyhing else on this phone is great!:2016-10-01:Kevin l
Samsung Galaxy S7:Android over IOS?:I bought the S7 as an upgrade to my iPhone6.  First time using Android, so this may not be fair, but up to now, I do not see any benefits over the IOS.  About the same.:2016-09-30:grazz1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great customer service:Very happy. Love the phone. Would be 5 stars but battery drains very fast:2016-09-29:Cjsk 426
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone:Had it for a week, so far, no complaints:2016-09-29:Iamnakpa
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy 7s:Very happy with my phone:2016-09-28:Bert 1972
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice features, great camera:Bought it about a week ago to replace my S5. This is an awesome phone. A couple of down sides is, of course, battery life and the headphone port being on the bottom of phone. It's not a big deal but it can be annoying. When I am on my treadmill I have to set my phone on the side instead of upright. No biggie, just something to get used to. Love the camera.:2016-09-28:NoraMC6469
Samsung Galaxy S7:easy transition from old phone with lots of new features:I have a lot yet to learn about the new phone:2016-09-28:Chandra12
Samsung Galaxy S7:So far so good:I really just got this phone and so far I'm liking it. Coming from a Droid mini the screen size is impressive. Haven't really had time to do anything but set it up but the calls I've had sound great. Took a few pictures and so far the ones i took look amazing. Its fast enough jumping around and loading and what I'm loving is the battery,I'm not charging 4 times a day like I was with the Droid.:2016-09-27:Kevin774
Samsung Galaxy S7:HTC to Samsung:It has taken a little getting used to, but overall I liking it.:2016-09-27:David8
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesome:I got this phone a about a week ago and am wondering if I should upgrade to an edge:2016-09-27:MalliereMaori
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7:The Galaxy S7 is a little difficult for me. What I do not like about it is the messaging keeps wanting to switch from Messages to Messenger. I can't keep it set to Messages. The other feature I don't like is, when you want to delete the messages from phone calls. You have to press delete 3 times.... Why not just once? And I can't delete messages from Messenger. One thing I do like about this phone, the pictures are very clear. I like the slimness of the phone. The screen is bright and the colors are sharp.:2016-09-27:Starider52
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Features, Step up from S5:I got this phone about a week ago, and it has been a seamless transition from the S5. I will always go with Samsung, it has been the best in my experience:2016-09-27:alex2456754
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone , love it!:"I just got this phone on 9/18/16. as an upgrade as my previous phone was accidentally pushed into a. sink of water.    I was upset that my niece damaged it & upset that the previous salesman I bough the phone from a ""yr. Ago"" never had insurance on it. ""All"" my Verizon phones always had full insurance & my daughters also, when I paid for her phone on my acct. . I've been with VW last 25 yrs.":2016-09-26:Br1960
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good. Not perfect but close.:Wish the battery lasted longer but still a good phone:2016-09-26:Njoyment420691
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, excellent camera and strong features:I bought this a week ago and think it's great. A lot of features, responds quickly and WATERPROOF....WHAT!  Seriously, this is an excellent phone and can't wait until I find how to use all its features:2016-09-26:John the leprechaun
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not what I wanted but had to settle with something since my S4 died:I truly wanted the Note 5 64 Gig but they don't carry them in stock. It would take a week to receive one. That's not acceptable when my phone is my life...my everything. I needed a phone that Sunday since my S4 died the night before. I'm lost without a phone!!!:2016-09-26:Dawn Arrowood
Samsung Galaxy S7:good features and fast but hungry:"great phone, plenty fast, but even with power saving mode on I seem to go through battery life faster than my company phone (Galaxy S5). if power saving mode is on and I turn the screen back on from being in a ""sleep state"" I notice I have to turn off wireless or data and turn it back on again to be able to access the internet services otherwise it will say ""connected"" but it will not access the internet at all. extremely annoying!":2016-09-26:MiteeFastWhitey
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone:I bought it a few weeks ago and I'm still figuring everything out. I really like the phone tho.:2016-09-26:Jeffers86
Samsung Galaxy S7:I love the pictures it takes:I got this phone as an upgrade from my HTC one, best upgrade ever!:2016-09-25:Rach1014
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone and the sound quality is excellent.:2016-09-25:Shertaz
Samsung Galaxy S7:OK:S7 does not automatically pair with car as S4 did.  Subaru recognizes phone, but I have to go to settings and connect it that way every time I start the car.  Is a gross pain in the neck.:2016-09-25:Kilwinning
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone:I went from a note 4 to the s7 I was concerned about the size at first.  After a few days and a case the smaller size is much easier to contain at work! Love this phone.:2016-09-24:Gina2130
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery life:Thought battery life would be better. Not any better then my old Galaxy4s:2016-09-23:SteveKOV
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not much better than my galaxy 4:I wish I could have just kept my 4 because it had things the 7 doesn't.  I do think the camera and video on the 7 will be nicer.:2016-09-23:Izzie1234
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung s7:Bought a month ago.  Phone is nice:2016-09-23:Victor24
Samsung Galaxy S7:good:bought a month ago still cant figure how to do everything:2016-09-23:ttmm
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition, fast phone:I got the phone two weeks ago and I like the speed the ease of the applications and the ability to modify all the settings to make it more of my personality the downside is the call reception is poor compared to my last phone the Samsung Galaxy S4:2016-09-22:KEVIN2222
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great product.:I'm an Apple convert. Love it other than not having iTunes on the phone. I can live with it but android needs a really good music app like Apple has.:2016-09-22:Bstentz78
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone!:Great phone, great camera, nice to be able and add an SD card. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I feel it could have a better battery life. After a day of sporadic use the battery is down to 50%.:2016-09-22:tody
Samsung Galaxy S7:my gremlin:Still getting use to it. Has some features I.m not familiar with yet:2016-09-22:Jeanmar

Samsung Galaxy S7:Lots to learn:Still learning everything this phone can do.:2016-09-21:Susanbrox
Samsung Galaxy S7:so far so good:Battery seems great, getting used to the new features, sharp colors.:2016-09-20:rugman57
Samsung Galaxy S7:Upgraded to Galaxy S7!:Overall, the S7 seems to be everything I need in a smartphone. From having great durability  while being very accessible, it is a quality product I'm quite pleased with.   The biggest features I'm very satisfied with would have to be the battery life and customisable features that help make the smartphone truly my own.  The only thing I miss from older generation smartphones is the simplicity is no longer there but it is well worth the sacrafice.:2016-09-20:SpiritGosu
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone is great:I bought the Samsung Galaxy 7 & I love it! It gets hot when charging other than that it's a good phone. Switched from Motorola to Samsung.:2016-09-20:Mikjo
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very good overall. Fast, beautiful screen.:I love these galaxy devices. Systems are fast, screen is not only beautiful but bright and very responsive. Camera is also very good.  Only a couple things I would like to see. First fix this charging issue in which it tells you the port has detected moisture just because it's not a brand new Samsung charger. Second I wish you would integrate some optical zoom into the camera.:2016-09-20:Rschumacher11
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love features:I purchased this phone because I love Samsung products. It is performing l thought it would. Great features love the size not too big. Really love the camera.:2016-09-20:Swindle
Samsung Galaxy S7:NICE PHONE BUT:Second phone. First one and I think after the first patch, it would not recognize my swipe patternot. Had to swap phone out. Will not download patch until I know it is a secure patch.:2016-09-19:Eagletide
Samsung Galaxy S7:Fast, efficient and easy to use:Changed up from a Blackberry Z10 and the transition has been easy and effortless. Pretty instinctive and the clarity of screen is excelent.:2016-09-19:HK1956
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone. Really still checking it out !:Only had this phone for a week.:2016-09-18:Cline_d
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointed with the stated 20 hour battery life vs the actual battery life.:I'm disappointed with the stated 20 hour battery life.  I have to turn way down the brightness of the screen.  I have the settings set where I have to do everything manually to save the battery.  I just don think I should have to be that particular especially with a new phone.:2016-09-18:techtodd
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it as I did previous one:Like previous  Samsung and when a fall broke it I upgraded.  Again very much like new one:2016-09-18:Mj604
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good:I love the phone but when I got this is really wanted the note 7 that why only 4 stars:2016-09-18:Big rob
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use:Very happy with new Gs 7:2016-09-18:Nicki Renee
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice size and great features:I bought it one month ago and so far it's been great.:2016-09-17:Giants70
Samsung Galaxy S7:After Transition nightmare...great phone:The registration process too three days and a visit to a Verizonstore...but it seems to be marching along, with only a few huck ups.:2016-09-17:deRoland
Samsung Galaxy S7:I liked what I researched:does what I expected except I still cannot sync my google addresses:2016-09-17:douglas1223
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone Could Be Better:This is the absolute best Android Phone you will ever use, especially if both Software and Hardware matter to you.  If you are pure Android OS fan, then this phone may not be a good choice for you. However this is as close a competition Android will ever give to Apple, overall the phone runs very smooth with some very good functionality and superior hardware design.  For me the achilles heel for this particular phone is its battery life or lack thereof, and it may be a deal breaker for many who are looking to buy a phone which will last them at least 8 hours with normal usage. If that is you, then this phone is not for you and it's a shame that such a fantastic phone in every other respect fails on such a critical metric.  If you are coming over from IOS and like the ease of use and routine updates, I would advise you to stay put. Android ECO system 8 years later is still a mess, marred with irregular updates and lack of support.  Again if you are OK with subpar battery life and do not care for ISO Eco system you cannot go wrong with the best phone Android has to offer:2016-09-17:AliRiz
Samsung Galaxy S7:I brought this phone a week ago and I'm glad I did but I keep getting people complaining about not being able to hear me.:Microphone issues a problem:2016-09-16:Frustratedmeandfamily
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:I just bought this phone, it does what I want takes amazing pictures and the display is the best. The only negative thing I have to say is that it seems my battery dies faster then ever. Maybe it's just what I'm doing...but I still love the phone.:2016-09-16:Bri83
Samsung Galaxy S7:Attractive Phone BUT lacking battery power:"The battery does not hold all day long.  With just a few texts or short telephone calls, my battery needs recharging within 8 hours.   My emails don't refresh as quick as it did on my Samsung S4.  When I clear my emails from my PC, they should also clear on the phone but can lag 24 hours before that is done.  I don't like that the dual screens to access your phone.  One screen for ""sleeping"", then another screen to swipe, then a 3rd screen to enter my password - way too complicated for security.  Put the password screen on top.  I do like Samsung phones for the camera and great clear, crisp images.  This one is comfortable in the hand.  The price of these phones is ridiculous and NOT justified.  My 4 year old S4 phone died so had to purchase a new one but if had to do over would really consider the older simpler phones that just text and talk.":2016-09-16:Sandytoes5555
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, but needs tweaking for battery life:"This phone is fast, light, and easy to use. If the battery life was set out of the box this phone would be a 5 Star. You need to set some ""out of the box"" apps to disabled or cut off the function so that they don't drain the battery.":2016-09-16:Bigal921
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features:I like the new Samsung 7 Android phone. It has a lot of features. I did buy the lifeproof cover like I did when I got my Samsung 5, but it does not fit real well on the edges sometimes making typing difficult. (I did not buy the curved model phone either) Also the voice to text is not as good as it used to be. Many errors and I do not mumble. Other that these 2 issues, I do really like the phone.:2016-09-16:Kels011
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone lousy operating system:I'm pleased with the phone but the operating system is terrible:2016-09-16:GENERALMADDAWG
Samsung Galaxy S7:New Samsung Galaxy 7:I bought the new phone and am impressed. It is easy to use and the battery holds a charge much longer. My previous phone was the Galaxy 5S.:2016-09-15:Ctresident
Samsung Galaxy S7:Somewhat easy move from S3, but still lots of changes.  I still don't know how to take out the battery, need to call super salesperson Ms. Isham:I love the cordless charging and the color, but the cordless charging made my decision.  It does take some getting used to as the back (lower right) is different use, etc.  My salesperson, Ms. Isham out of Midland, MI is super and the ONLY person I will ruse and recommend from now on.:2016-09-15:deb029
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the S7!:Just purchased the Samsung Galaxy S7 a week ago. Really like it. When I turn on the phone and I have emails waiting my S5 would give me the option to delete the unwanted emails very easily by clicking the boxes in front of the email titles and push Delete just once to delete all unwanted emails. I miss that feature. The size and face of the phone are perfect. Although my contacts were transferred to the new S7 some information on each contact was missing forcing me to go through each contact to complete the info. That has been very time consuming. Other than that I am very pleased with my new S7.:2016-09-15:Azjo2028
Samsung Galaxy S7:4063637099:So far this device has been very good to use.:2016-09-15:Codeman33
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy S7:Upgraded from a S4 to the S7 and so far so good. I really like the camera and the battery life.:2016-09-15:Mck2720
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very easy transition!:I had the galaxy s5 not much different but runs faster.:2016-09-14:Blthomas
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice improvement over the Galaxy S6.:Phone does have several nice improvements over the Galaxy S6 such as the addition of a micro SD card slot and water proofing the phone.  There is a couple negatives to go with it, no IR blaster and no Quick Charge 3.0.:2016-09-14:Billy8098
Samsung Galaxy S7:Its ok:My old phone stopped charging thus I had to upgrade to a newer phone.:2016-09-14:lbpatton
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very similar to the Samsung galaxy s5:I had to return my first phone the day after receiving it because callers had a hard time hearing me.  They would say that my voice was breaking up when I was seated in the same place.  My signal has always been strong so that is not an issue.  I also do not like how I cannot change the background color of my contacts list.  It is an ugly orange color.  I  contact Samsung and they couldn't do it either.:2016-09-14:rockycez
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone, set up instructions lacking:I really like this phone.  I previously had an S6, which received water damage and could no longer be used as a phone.  So glad to be able to purchase the S7.  I would have given it 5 stars, but the information for setting up the S7 was sorely lacking and frustrating.:2016-09-13:Marthalowi
Samsung Galaxy S7:New galaxy 7s:Bought this a couple weeks ago, getting used to it. But all in all great phone:2016-09-13:Max the million
Samsung Galaxy S7:it was easy to get things from my old phone to my new one:I got this phone a month ago and so far i like it:2016-09-13:dodge40
Samsung Galaxy S7:Requested Review:Phone is fragile but ok.:2016-09-13:Time Wasted
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition:A lot to learn after my windows phone. Still figuring things out.:2016-09-13:Sblentz
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7:I've had my phone exchange about 2 weeks now.  It's okay.:2016-09-13:Loleela
Samsung Galaxy S7:New phone:So far so good.  Better than previous phone:2016-09-13:Meschelle
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy 7:Some subtle changes, but great device.:2016-09-13:Tony L
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good:It was easy to transfer information over from my S5 to the S7, but it seems to connect really slow in large crowds. For example, I was trying to connect to Pokemon Go at the same time the guy next to me was, he had an S6. He connected and mine would not connect. It was so slow in connecting. Not sure what the problem is. I thought is was supposed to be faster. Other than that, I have found it to be a good phone, sleek in its design.:2016-09-12:audleyg
Samsung Galaxy S7:Similar to my previous s5.:Just had it for 2 weeks. Still discovering stuff about it:2016-09-12:Terryace
Samsung Galaxy S7:I bought this phone 2 weeks ago. It has been easy to use:Phone is ok at this point in time.:2016-09-12:Fish more
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy change over.:I've had this for about a month.  It was easy to transfer all of my stuff as I have Google.  The phone battery is supposed to lay longer than the S6, but it doesn't seem to.:2016-09-12:RHill0315
Samsung Galaxy S7:over all ok.:I don't like that I can't assign different notifications for each person's text, On my old phone family members had their own tones to let me know who is texting me so I know how quickly I need to get back to them. Now I have one for everyone even though I have a different tone assigned to family.:2016-09-12:t83h
Samsung Galaxy S7:samasung galaxy 7s and verizon performance:still out on the fence about this one. Had a nokia lumia and it seems it was easier to use. One really annoying thing is a samsung banner for apps keeps appearing off and on at start up and about any other time. example samsung pay, etc, wish they woudl stop.. galaxy essentials keep popping up. when i want something, i'll get it.:2016-09-12:whatever 1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Overall pleased:Upgraded from an S5. Overall happy. Had a few issues with the transfer so I'm still working on getting everything set back up. Was told everything would transfer. Most did. Power button is in a slightly different location so I keep accidentally hitting it. A couple of features from the old phone I do miss.:2016-09-12:AntLes
Samsung Galaxy S7:Like it more and more everyday:Great phone. Battery could be a bit better and it tends to get really hot. Camera is amazing!:2016-09-11:Eamon
Samsung Galaxy S7:Finally, A Phone You Can Talk On:"I've stayed away from Android phones because their voice quality is shallow and muddy.  The S7 is a real exception.  Call clarity is topnotch; it's almost Blackberry quality, and a huge improvement over my last Android phone: Galaxy S3. As for the rest of the phone's functionality, there's nothing special.  The screen is bright and viewable in the sun, but other than that, it  runs like any other Android.  It  is terribly slippery and fragile, so a bumper case is a requirement before putting it to use.  But the terrific call quality is worth the premium price.":2016-09-11:GSNCA
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love all it can do; battery life not that great though.:I love the capability of this phone but I can almost literally watch the battery tick downwards. Maybe because I just switched from a windows phone and I'm not doing something right. Either way, awesome phone.:2016-09-09:Srp8945
Samsung Galaxy S7:Overall Review:I bought this phone a week ago, and I am very happy that I did:2016-09-09:bondaed76
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone but not perfect:I bought this phone a month ago and it's very high tech and cool. The only thing that is not so good about it are some typing glitches that have been present in previous galaxies as well.:2016-09-09:Sagqqq0
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy 7 s7:easy transition from the 5:2016-09-09:Mongo 1283

Samsung Galaxy S7:"Upgraded: S4 TO S7":So far it has been an easy  transition.:2016-09-07:Hippy hop
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone so far:I've has it for less than a week. Great so far:2016-09-06:Davepelfrey
Samsung Galaxy S7:Simple to use:I upgraded from the s5 after my charging port broke.  The antenna seems to be less effective than the s5, fewer bars at my house and more dropped calls, other than that, great phone:2016-09-06:Crismsu
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to transition from my GS5.:I like the slightly smaller size and fewer preloaded apps.:2016-09-05:Ried68
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use:I'm still learning my new phone. However, it has been very easy to do so.  It also takes really good pictures!:2016-09-04:Becky1kevin
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointed:"I thought that with 2x the memory that the S7 would run faster than my 16GB S5. No. WiFi at home seems much slower. Streaming videos is impossible because of the frequent stops. I am constantly getting a ""You're not connected to the internet"" error when riding in a bus or a cab. It New York City, for goodness Sake! Can't this stupid phone use the 4G network when I disconnect from WiFi? Apparently not. The protective glass cover I bought doesn't sit flat at the sides because the screen has a curve up on the sides. The salesperson said this would flatten out. After a week, it's no closers to being completely flat than it was when installed. The buttons and screen are so sensitive that I am constantly taking ""screen captures"" of the home screen or some unwanted app every time I put the phone in my shirt pocket. Nice screen image, but a major disappointment.":2016-09-04:Carabalda
Samsung Galaxy S7:New features:I have had the phone a week.  It was easy to get used to and I like the feature that shows you the text message while you are on the web and gives you the option to answer without ever leaving the webpage.  I don't like the white pages for background on phone app.  My s3 had lots of color.:2016-09-04:Tammy59
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy 7:I like the phone but hate the adds that keep popping up on my home screen. I have the pop up blockers on and they keep showing up...:2016-09-03:luterred
Samsung Galaxy S7:Decent phone:Touchscreen isn't great, but it does the job:2016-09-03:Jeremy888999888
Samsung Galaxy S7:Works well. Getting used to the changes.:I had an S5 and liked the functionality but it was getting old and messing up. I went with the S7 because it's familiar. The updates are taking some getting used to. I like it though.:2016-09-03:Mommyre
Samsung Galaxy S7:Title:It's so much faster.:2016-09-02:Dan 1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:Happy I bought it. Thanks.:2016-09-01:Mark Douglas

Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy-to-use:I am happy with my new cell:2016-08-31:PattieWH
Samsung Galaxy S7:I should have gone thru all of the training stuff.  A lot of changes from the S4 mini.:I liked the size of the S4. The heavy duty belt case is bigger than I like.  But overall the phone works well.  I  plan to get as used to it as can be expected for an 80 year old man.:2016-08-31:OLAND
Samsung Galaxy S7:Like light weight, battery could last longer.:Had for a week.  So far most everything good.  Thought battery life would be longer.  Camera good, I have not used all the features yet.:2016-08-31:Rachel57
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great deal @costco:Great deal@Costco!@!:2016-08-31:Adih
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very easy to transfer information from my old phone:I've had my phone for a week now and I like it better than my S4:2016-08-30:Debbieoberle47

Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it:Love my phone. Hate the battery life.:2016-08-29:merrynail
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung S7:I love this phone. Before I had the Samsung S5 and I loved that phone too! The camera upgrade is amazing.   I do miss the flashlight widget for the S7 and the new screen protectors have been a disappointment. They do not fully seal to the phone.:2016-08-29:ATP13
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy:It is a decent phone:2016-08-28:Crystalynne
Samsung Galaxy S7:Pretty pleased so far:I haven't had this a whole week yet but so far I love it:2016-08-28:kmb63
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not too different from S5:Feels cheaply made. Not as easy to delete batch emails on AOL as the S5. Choice of sounds are disappointingredients. I miss the whistle.:2016-08-27:RussPS
Samsung Galaxy S7:So much better than my S4 I can't begin to tell you.:I was desperate to get out of the S4 after 2 years of horror. Verizon replaced the fone 4 times trying to make me happy, but the fone was a piece of crud from day one. There was no way to make it work after the second or third upgrade. Terrible fone. Why upgrade beyond the fones capabilities is still the question i have?:2016-08-26:Scotthoust
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy s7:Bought one week ago, good phone:2016-08-25:flameman6680
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great so far:I've only had the phone for a week but I like it so far. No complaints.:2016-08-25:stm9399
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone:I like the phone it's different but I'm getting use to it:2016-08-25:bomberg
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's ok...:It a good phone overall but the battery life isn't as good as my 2 year old HTC M8. Some better camera features the the M8, but still a pretty good phone overall.:2016-08-24:Stupid nickname system
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition:Still trying to learn how to navigate on the new phone:2016-08-24:Rodtcb
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice smart phone:Very easy to use but seems to use a lot of data:2016-08-23:Taxman155
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone:Nice phone. Easy transition from the S5:2016-08-23:NvHunter
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone:This is the 3rd galaxy I have owned. Keep going back.:2016-08-23:Redpatty1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Too soon to give 5 stars:3 weeks of trouble free operation.:2016-08-23:Shnagglepuss
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice features but unpredictable initiation of apps and calls:This is a beautiful phone with great features. I have a hard shell case for my phone and carry it in my pocket. I am having a lot of trouble with applications being accidently launched that I never had with my Galaxy S4. The phone also initiates calls to random people in my contact list. I recently went to Europe for three weeks and took the phone along for wifi use. I did not have any phone service while there. Nonetheless, I incurred roaming charges for calls initiated without my knowledge.:2016-08-22:alinaz
Samsung Galaxy S7:Really like:Your tech support is the best I have ever encountered.:2016-08-22:hacklbk
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phones great:Got it 2 weeks ago still trying to figure out:2016-08-21:Craig60
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone like the features:Can't wait to get another of these phones liking the features.:2016-08-21:Littlebear230
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use.:"I bought this just over a week ago. I expected the battery to last a lot longer due to the specifications; it's lasting half the time (on power saver mode and with location & Bluetooth turned off). Swipe texting is not working as well as my old phone (s4 mini) & I have made a lot of errors... maybe it will just take a while to guess the word in trying to spell. I also think my old phone got better service at my house. I'm always having to repeat myself. (Maybe I  just got a lemon.) Lastly I am still trying to get used to the size of the phone. I was very hesitant to buy the phone cause I really like the ""mini"" version,  but with the s7 mini over 4 months late being released, I'm guessing it won't be. PLEASE BRING BACK THE MINI!!!":2016-08-20:Bipppy137
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, easy to use, clear pictures long range reception.:Very happy with the phone but taking pictures needs improvement. Usually outdoor pictures on a sunny day seem to turn out very well. However, indoor pictures can be hazy & difficult to discern detail.:2016-08-20:My nickname is already us
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung galaxy s7:Awesome phone! I had the galaxy s6 for 3 years,  and I finally upgraded.:2016-08-20:ALE613
Samsung Galaxy S7:Splendiferous!:For once, I am happy that my olde phone crapped out on me, the s7 is wonderfully updated! -^,..,^- Games play smoother, loading pages takes less time, and I must say, putting the speaker on the bottom of the phone is a MUCH better idea than on the back, the sound is much more clear. I'm a bit disappointed that I can't create my own folders on the homescreen, unless I can and just haven't figured it out yet. The biggest let down though is that all previous conversations on one of my chat apps (Kakao) have completely disappeared. The different threads are there, but the conversations aren't. I also have to uninstall  a few apps I'm probably not going to be using, but other than all that, this phone is fantastic! -^,..,^-:2016-08-18:Lady_Lost
Samsung Galaxy S7:Quick response:The reason I'm giving 4 stars is because I think the battery could be a little better:2016-08-18:Jacklyn1992
Samsung Galaxy S7:Pretty good:Phone freezes occasionally.  A reboot unlocks it.  You have to be very careful adding additional memory...the holder is made of very flimsy,  cheap plastic.  Fast charger is awesome.  Overall very happy:2016-08-18:Smokeyg
Samsung Galaxy S7:Complicated more than S4. Fewer options to store apps on external storage.  Battery life is the best I've seen for a cell phone.:It's OK.  Settings are lacking a bit compared to s4 but maybe after getting used to it will become more comfortable.:2016-08-18:Tim Fraz
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone:I recently upgraded and I'm glad I did.:2016-08-18:Fattiemcbibbles
Samsung Galaxy S7:FIrst smart phone:Nice phone! Better than my blackberry. I didn't know it was running many applications and it ate up all my data. The Verizon salesman should have said something. Also when I renewed my contract, my leftover data should have been added to the new plan.:2016-08-18:Sasso
Samsung Galaxy S7:Size:I went from the Note 5, to Galaxy #7... much easier to handle.:2016-08-17:TBJS
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:I had to exchange my first S7 because of screen defects. Since I have exchanged for a new S7 I love it. Great design and the battery life is good:2016-08-17:Leffew42
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love Everything but the battery:love everything about my new Galaxy S7. same great features, camera is better, interface is cleaner. but the battery is awful. i have to charge halfway through my day if i want it to last to the evening, and that is with minimal usage. hopefully this gets fixed with the next software update.....:2016-08-17:mgtiger
Samsung Galaxy S7:Birthday gift:Love it!! My dream phone!!:2016-08-17:Mammie2009
Samsung Galaxy S7:New:Upgrade due to broke my 4s. Only complaint so far is that it wants to update software daily. Get aggravating pop-ups constantly. Can't seem to make it go away.:2016-08-16:De01
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone:"It's not very different from the G5, but the battery is much better. Only problem: the auto-correct is way too sensitive. Now, it's including every email address in my contacts. Hate that.":2016-08-16:Soulesmj
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7 Galaxy:Bought this S7 a couple of weeks ago..I love it..still have lotsto learn!:2016-08-16:Kathie49
Samsung Galaxy S7:Epic performance Beautiful display/Runs Hot!:I upgraded to the S7 for only 1 reason, Gear VR. I'm a game developer and I wanted a device to side load my apks. The phone is great, reception great, performance is amazing, display is unreal, battery life is great for stock (You can't upgrade or access the battery so I count that against this model). Also when running VR apps or high resolution games the S7 gets hot and not a little hot it freaking bakes and starts to throttle the cores to reduce the heat which results in laggy and nausea. I kill everything except my VR apps and it still is scorching. Since Verizon can't fix this I suggest you use the Gear VR or Cardboard in front of your A/C or a strong fan until Winter. ;-P:2016-08-15:Snowcrash
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone!:I bought my Galaxy S7 about two (2) weeks ago and am still learning how to use.  This was a drastic update from a very old Galaxy so lots of new bells and whistles which I am not familiar with.  Wish it can with a users guide.:2016-08-15:SBishop
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not to shabby:The battery isn't as good as advertised. Also you can't set different sounds for email and text  messages. All in all not a bad phone but it could use a some tweaking.:2016-08-15:Stusak
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery a disappointment:I bought this phone because I had to charge the battery  for my S5 during the day.  The S7is not any bettet.:2016-08-15:Deb702
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone:I like my phone. There's a few things I haven't figured out yet. When phones are just a phone you don't know how to use all the extras.:2016-08-15:Hollice
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the phone:Not quite as easy to catch on to new features as I thought.:2016-08-14:donnahuth
Samsung Galaxy S7:Improved camera, clearer text, faster software:I bought this phone a few weeks ago, and like it; my only frustration is in trying to unlock it using my fingerprint; the phone only randomly recognizes it after several days of using the phone.:2016-08-14:Forget nickname
Samsung Galaxy S7:Slim feels Gooder in the hands:Little heavy for size of the phone:2016-08-14:Mcwepot
Samsung Galaxy S7:I'm used to the Galaxy S 5 so I've got a learning curve to endure.:I bought the phone on 7/30/16 only because I lost my S 5.  Because of this, my former data couldn't be downloaded to my new phone. The S 7 is a nice phone and takes good pictures.:2016-08-14:ooooooooooooooooooooo
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone, but not so seamless transition:"I'm transitioning from the S4. I'm finding that the transfer process wasn't as seamless as the last time. There are a lot of kinks to work through but overall a solid phone. I might have preferred the bigger screen of the note, but this is very similar in size to the phone that I had. Functionality to be determined and user error almost certainly a factor. :)":2016-08-14:Nurdi
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:One of the best cell I've own:2016-08-14:Kbreeze269
Samsung Galaxy S7:easy to transfer all my apps,contacts,photos and etc.:glad to be back to Samsung:2016-08-14:rofi
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone.:Like the galaxy 7 well. Transition was good. No problem with this new phone.:2016-08-14:Cfaith
Samsung Galaxy S7:Son like new phone, but using data:Since the phone was purchased, it has used data at an alarming rate. Can't figure out how to make it stop. Haven't had this problem before now.:2016-08-13:Bellejane
Samsung Galaxy S7:Amazingly easy-to-use and service is impeccable.:I am happy I switched over. The switch was very smooth. I love service!:2016-08-13:Cluz419

Samsung Galaxy S7:I love my new phone:I love the phone and features but I have had issues where I don't have service, I can't get online or my texts fail to send.  I never had any issues with my s5:2016-08-13:Colie625
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great pics:Bought spur of the moment phone died out of nowhere:2016-08-13:None why is this asked
Samsung Galaxy S7:Super phone, need better deal on data rates.:Great phone. Should come with cordless recharging stand.:2016-08-12:Reoman
Samsung Galaxy S7:New to me:I brought this a week ago and I'm  getting  used  to  it.:2016-08-12:Fly a kite
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use, has a lot of good features:I've had this phone for a couple of months and so far I like everything about the phone except for the fact that it draws all the info from internal storage only,  and is not capable of directly reading from the SD card,  where most of my files, pics and music are stored. In order for the phone to read the files and pics that I want it to read I have to make copies of all of the said files and pics and paste them into the internal memory just using up extra storage space which is stupid.  I also miss the upper and lower speaker strips my HTC had... This phone only has a small set of speaker holes at the bottom of the phone.:2016-08-12:Hipstre1
Samsung Galaxy S7:It is lighter than my last phone Samsung 4:The camera is crystal clear. everything else is fine:2016-08-11:Frammy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy Transition.:Had to exchange first phone due to mic issue.  So far so good.:2016-08-11:Bonny

Samsung Galaxy S7:Lost everything from my other phone:Only had this phone about a week.:2016-08-11:KaTate
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung is on the right track (At LAST!):"I've had a Galaxy since the original one was released and only skipping the Galaxy 2.  One of the things I have never liked TouchWiz.  They have consistently released a very poor GUI.    The S7 is snappy compared to previous iterations while adding a lot more visual appeal. I've typically started off by loading a new launcher to my phone immediately so it was a surprise to see how nice the S7 was with just a few ""ascetic"" features such as changing the grid size and themes.   The options/settings menu is much better organized and easier to use  as well from previous releases.  But I'm disappointed that a few things like counting steps seems to be missing from the always on screen or lock screen.   It's also too bad that they don't upgrade TouchWiz to new versions on older phones. I typically upgrade for power so it really wouldn't change my buying habits or frequency.  As for the physical aspect, it's beautiful and the first Galaxy that really feels like a  premium phone for price tag.  I would rather be able to swap batteries as I have in the past but the 3000mAh battery is a nice and the battery life over all seems solid as does the charging speed.  The game launcher and game tools are also seem like a nice touch that I haven't had the chance to play with as much as I'd like.   Overall, it meets most of my expectations.  I want to have more time with the camera but so far it looks fantastic.   The other thing, outside of TouchWiz that Samsung seems to always mess up is major updates and causing battery drain but we'll see how it handles the first big update.  My S5 was a nightmare, here's to hoping they get this right as well.":2016-08-10:WanderlustX2
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone.:It is great. A little bigger and heavier than my previous phone. It works great. It has lot of memory. Awesome for watching stuff on it. I like that it has kids mode. After I organized everything my way I love it.:2016-08-10:Lilok
Samsung Galaxy S7:generally good:the phone is a good product - fast effective  Still has the problem that caused me to a new phone, battery strength insufficient to last the full day.  Even when powered off the battery continues to lose charge:2016-08-09:k two
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great but a bigger screen is needed:Great but could use a bigger screen:2016-08-09:Green Bay
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy Review:Good storage space. Quick operating system.  It continually updates which is sometimes difficult. I'm sure it's just being new. Love the phone and it's capability.:2016-08-09:Joe L
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not too different from I phone. Great camera!:Way more features than I will ever use but I am old and not tech savvy. I have not found it too difficult to navigate.Longer battery life than I Phone. Chose it for the camera and am not disappointed. Love it!:2016-08-08:golfgal123

Samsung Galaxy S7:Like item but tryin to adjust. Have not had time to really discover all the potential of it.:Just bought it a week ago and still learning.:2016-08-08:Jonnep
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, but...:This phone is super easy to use coming from any other Android (specifically Samsung) device. However, this phone gets HOT! and quick! If I need to use the GPS in my car, I have to rig it to stick out of the air vents to stay cool or it will be almost too hot to touch. It also gets very hot just playing a game at times. The battery life is just fine. This is a computer in your hand, so it's going to run down. However, this is the FASTEST charging phone I've had. I've had this almost 6 months, and I'm very happy other than the temperature. It's unbearable at times.:2016-08-08:JackSan
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great new phone:Thought it was about time I got a new phone.I love this new phone works faster and charges a lot faster than my old Galaxy 4:2016-08-08:Petcherry

Samsung Galaxy S7:Liking this new phone.:I like that this is lighter weight than my old phone. Still learning all the stuff.:2016-08-07:dianec89
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use:I didn't want to give up my S4, but I was having problems with the WI-FI even after to doing a factory reset. I reluctantly went with the S7.  I love it.  All the things I loved about the S4 are very similar on the S7. The photos and the video are so much better.  Very happy with the upgrade.  Not having any of the battery problems I read about on the Internet.:2016-08-07:Micki2u
Samsung Galaxy S7:It has a lot of good features that I still have to learn:I like how long it goes before it needs to be charged:2016-08-07:Mrs Wall
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features! Easy to use:I have and the phone for about a week now. It is easy to use but I have lost signal in my house. It drops calls and is incapable of using the launcher I used to use. While away from home the phone is fantastic:2016-08-07:Josh M
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good Phone:I love the Samsung S7.  It was an easy transition from my old phone.  Bright screen and great colors are nice.  My only problem with this phone is that it doesn't hold my wifi.  It will stay connected to my wifi for a bit and then it loses it and I don't get any notifications or anything until it finds the internet again.  I was thinking it was my internet but my old phone had no problems and my Chromebook works great as well.  Not sure what the problem is or how to fix it, but overall a great phone.  I also do not get 4G network when at home but I did with my old phone, however, the call quality is ok.:2016-08-06:Katharine51
Samsung Galaxy S7:Only a week old, still getting used to it, but like what I see so far:No thanks at this time:2016-08-06:Buddy bill
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features, love the ability to upgrade the storage:I bought this phone a few weeks ago and I like it a lot. A lot different than my s4, but not necessarily bad. A lot of features that are helpful. I like the Kids mode for my two little ones. It's incredibly fast and it has great battery life. Only complaint is that it seems to take a whIle to charge.:2016-08-06:Noshizumi
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the features of the phone and the customer service!:Great  phone. Love the shortcuts. Great pictures. Easy to use. Got hot when I used the video camera for a long video but cooled down quick . Downfall takes a while to charge and cost.  Luckily we are on the payment plan.:2016-08-06:HappyVerizoncustom
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy Transition from my prior phone:Good phone, similiar to the Galaxy 5, but lighter and charges faster.:2016-08-06:jtvjohn1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesome phone!:"This is my 2nd galaxy series phone.  Love the removable memory & the voicemail feature. The improvements on other features really make this phone easier to use. The  HD phone addition is so clear!  It's like the person you're  talking to is right next to you.  There's none of that ""can you hear me now?"" anymore!":2016-08-06:Kay H
Samsung Galaxy S7:great, except unable to transfer photos to mac:bought is and still can not upload photos and videos to my mac. Else a great phone.:2016-08-05:Maronstein
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great graphics!:It has  only been a couple of weeks but all of the features of the S6 are present.  My only concern is I lose coverage in different parts of my home.  I didn't have this problem with the S6.:2016-08-05:Tammy Cool
Samsung Galaxy S7:Missing some of my favorite features, but some new features are awesome:"I switched from the Galaxy S4 to the S7. I really like the new home feature that lets you quick close all the open apps instead of having to long-press the home key. However, I really miss the option to use the volume key to adjust the font size in text messages automatically instead of having to dig it out of an options sub-menu. Also, neither of the messaging apps will let me customize the bubble message style the way you used to be able to on the S4.  Overall functionality on the S7 is much speedier, and the apps mostly run smoother than on the S4. Battery-life is improved, so it lasts all day even with heavy GPS use. The ""always-on"" screen feature with the clock & calendar is awesome, so I don't have to actually blip the screen on to see what time it is.  Love love love that it's 32 GB internal storage with the expandable slot (up to 200GB!, as I have a large catalog of music that I like to haul around with me via the SD card.  Although there's a few things I miss from my old phone, I am more or less very satisfied with this upgrade.":2016-08-05:LadyMew
Samsung Galaxy S7:Excellent Phone:I hav3e used this phone for a week and it is everything I expected. Qutie an improvement from my SG S5.:2016-08-05:bgroome71
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good Phone, but......:"The phone hardware is terrific but the problem is that both Samsung and Verizon load useless apps some of which cannot be removed. I was able to get all of the games off, although a pop up screen keeps coming up for a ""game optimizer.""  The more serious issue is with the software updates. Every time I have accepted the update, something bad happens to the phone.  Right now the phones works fine. I wish there was a way to stop the updates permanently. On one of my other phones (Samsung S6) after the update the phone was non-functional and after wiping it it still could not be restored. Obviously, I will not take the update on the new phone.":2016-08-05:Candlestyx
Samsung Galaxy S7:Pretty good... still haven't figured it all out:My info was brought in from old phone, or so I was told. However, I cannot find a calendar app in what came on new phone to bring in the information from the calendar on the old phone.   I think what I was using on old phone is what came on it, however last update created some issues on the old one. Why do updates mess up what you have us using?  I know that updates have messed with my calendar before, changing how it looks, seemkng to make it work different...:2016-08-05:silverlady2
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone, Galaxy has come a long way:It is a great looking phone, and I have noticed a significant improvement in battery endurance over my Galaxy S5. It runs pretty smoothly though some of the keyboard spots on the lower edge of the screen are not as sensitive as I would like.:2016-08-04:MDB15637
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy S7 seems solid:I have only had this phone about 2 weeks.  It seems solid enough for a Galaxy phone.  I liked my S5, and I like they brought back removable memory.  I still hate the bloat ware I have to disable, and for the life of me can't understand why verizon still puts VZ Navigator on a phone.  Overall phone seems to be in line with most of the past Samsung Phones I have owned.:2016-08-04:Me At Verizon
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love.it:Just bought last week. Nice and easy to use.:2016-08-04:Deta
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Pictures! Love the flash for selfies!!!:Love the camera, the battery seems to die quicker than the S5 but still lasts long enough.  Do not like that the edges have a small taper (roundness) to them where the nice tempered glass screen covers can not completely stick to the whole screen on the edges. I'd prefer a flat screen with no taper/curve on the edges.:2016-08-04:MissyNae
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone easy transfer solid support:I have had Samsung Android phones for years and I enjoy their ease of use and their reliability:2016-08-03:TomTom1253

Samsung Galaxy S7:Love my Galaxy:Glad to finally be back to a Galaxy:2016-08-03:Momkellyd
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone but eats the battery:I love this phone and there are so many great features but you have to charge it twice a day. It has a great camera with panoramic, virtual shot - 360 view, slow motion, hyperlapse and live broadcast. It has a MicroSD card slot, Bluetooth works great, as well as the fingerprint sensor. I just started using the S Health and I'm loving the S Voice. There are so many goodies packed in this phone. What can I say? It's a great phone and it's water resistant. Now if the battery would last a full day, I'd give it 5 stars.:2016-08-03:Elequence1
Samsung Galaxy S7:It was easy as it was a lot like my s4:I am very happy with it so far:2016-08-02:No name available
Samsung Galaxy S7:Still getting used some of changes:So far, I love the phone, but still trying to figure out why some of the button functionalities were changed.  It is taking some adjustment.  Takes GREAT pictures.:2016-08-02:mrskaria
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy 7:Still getting used to it but I like it:2016-08-02:Lisa529
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone!:I bought this phone about two weeks ago and so far it has been great! The camera on this phone is fantastic! Im a little worried though that that battery dies quickly. Otherwise great purchase.:2016-08-02:Dconley
Samsung Galaxy S7:Upgrade with Great Extras!:Bought this a few weeks ago and it's been a great addition. It runs much faster and has better graphics and screen.:2016-08-01:pianomusiclove
Samsung Galaxy S7:GRAND CAMERA:I liked this phone and LOVE the front flash and the underwater functions. I just wished that they figured out the advanced calling for all carriers.:2016-08-01:ObiU
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:Great phone even better service!:2016-07-31:Khadijah
Samsung Galaxy S7:Much faster:It is not that much different than the S4 but I did have some operational issues with the S4. I wish the font were bigger. It is fast and the battery 1 week out does seem to be lasting longer.:2016-07-31:jowr
Samsung Galaxy S7:Really a treat:Love the phone so far. Looking forward to testing it out more.:2016-07-31:Treat
Samsung Galaxy S7:Gallery:"Having difficulty with FB pictures on gallery. I get a message "" unfortunately Gallery has stopped working. So the Verizon representative put it into a safe mode. So that there would not be a third party app open. A bit confused, especially when paying so much for the phone.":2016-07-31:Ljaffoni
Samsung Galaxy S7:Pretty good:"I used to have a Galaxy S3, moved to a Droid Turbo and am now back to the Samsung Galaxy S7.  So far I'm pleased.  It fits in my hand better than the Droid, which was big.  The button configuration is a little different but I'm getting used to it.  My main complaints are 1) the phone is so slim and compact it feels a bit ""dainty"" and I worry it will shatter if it falls.  Problem solved with a good phone case.  2) holding the phone with my left hand, my pad below my thumb would very often activate the Q or A key inadvertently when texting with my thumb.  The edge of the screen is so close and the phone so thin that accidental text gets entered easily.  Again solved with a good case.  So far I am pleased with the phone.  Oh and so far the camera is the best I've seen/used in a smart phone so far.":2016-07-31:Ex Droid user
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Features:I needed an upgrade. The salesman was Perfect, he did not misguide me (not that he could). I'm satisfied.:2016-07-31:Alljr

Samsung Galaxy S7:transiton good...phone working good:I didnt have any issues with transition. Phone is good...doesnt connect to my wifi right away...and have to disconnect and reconnect to b4 browsing.:2016-07-31:Mateo1989
Samsung Galaxy S7:Pretty Nice!:"Upgraded from Moto x 2nd gen. It's a great phone- I love the themes, and it seems to do some great pictures. One thing it fails at though is voice control. On my moto I could say ""play My Chemical Romance on Spotify"" and it would launch Spotify and play the playlist. On the s7, it somehow concatenates the phrase into gibberish it can't understand at all. That was very useful for me when I'm stuck in traffic. So -1 star for what I feel is a pretty crucial feature that SHOULD be working better in newer phones.":2016-07-31:Rhiow
Samsung Galaxy S7:easy transition from old phone:I guess I need time to learn new things on the phone.:2016-07-30:kjy123
Samsung Galaxy S7:So far, so good:This is my eighth day.  I use very few functions.  The phone performs well so far.:2016-07-30:Jeff41
Samsung Galaxy S7:4238025446:Do not like as much as I thought I would.  Screen is too small and print is too small.:2016-07-30:Dmcd1953
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features!:This is a very nice looking phone. I love the option to have themes on your phone!:2016-07-30:Cassie22
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features, still getting used to all that I can do with it.:I just got my new phone 4 days ago.  I'm still getting used to all that I can do with it.  So far, I love what it is capable of doing.  There are a couple of apps that I won't use so will disable them.:2016-07-30:Jenny c
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use:I just really like the way it is easy to use and operate:2016-07-30:Apeman
Samsung Galaxy S7:great features easy transition better voice clarity worse email tracking:need better product than Samsung S5 got it but email settings I cannot augment to sync all emails to my phone when I am away from home; otherwise very good phone upgrade and worth the money:2016-07-30:jbaronas1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Excited to try th VR headgear:I had the S5 before and i LOVED it so much!! Upgraded to the S7 as i heard they fixed all the issues from the S6 and im pretty happy with it!

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone but has one little problem:I bought this phone about 2 weeks ago and its a great phone. The only thing that I dont like is sometimea that the screen will lock and then you can not unlock it and you have to do the factory mood restart or factory mood turn off that is the only problem that I have with the phone besides that its a great phone.:2016-07-29:Firekracker2014
Samsung Galaxy S7:A few oddities, but so far so good:There's no menu button, which is ODD and takes some getting used to. Other features are really good.  Battery seems to last a solid chunk of time.  GPS works better than my previous Samsung.:2016-07-29:KarenBH
Samsung Galaxy S7:IM A HAPPY GIRL:loved my Note 3 , but it was time to retire my friend, so I treated myself to the latest and greatest galaxy s7. im a happy girl and my note 3 can rest easy now........:2016-07-29:marinersgirl
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it.:The only part I didn't like was my stupidity and forgetting my password so I had to wait 24 hours to access my phone due to factory reset. But like I said it was my fault. I love it.:2016-07-29:Katie0913
Samsung Galaxy S7:Ease of use:I've only had the phone for a couple of weeks and am impressed with the capabilities it has over my previous one.:2016-07-28:Joe Alvarez

Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7:Purchased this phone a week ago. This is my third phone in the Galaxy series. As always, Samsung delivers a quality product.:2016-07-27:the_teed
Samsung Galaxy S7:Updated:I bought this phone about a month ago and for the most part I am happy with it but it's hard to believe an updated phone doesn't have software that supports the simplest thing as being able to use individual contact message tones, that is disappointing to me.:2016-07-27:Debmb
Samsung Galaxy S7:Similar to S4:Bought the phone a week ago, works good has a really great camera.:2016-07-27:jadbad2004
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery Drains Fast:Battery life sucks, in standby it's fine but once you start using anything it dies down real quick. Everything else about the phone itself is great!:2016-07-27:subc0der

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, besides one setting.:"I love this phone besides the ""screen overlay"" setting that doesn't allow anything to work together. I have a bank app for my bank and the camera can't function for the mobile deposit setting in the app because of the screen overlay setting.":2016-07-27:EmiBee
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the s7 but.....:"I upgraded from the s4.  Very disappointed that the menu button on the lower left is gone and replaced with ""close all windows"" on the home screen.  It's useless for me.  I've adapted to the changes on the s7.  Was able to personalize the phone the way I like it.  If I need help I just Google and get my answer.  I always had a problem printing with the s4, but the s7 prints from my wifi printer without a problem. The photos I take seem to be more  vibrant in color.  The battery charge lasts a little longer.  I'm not a gamer and I don't stream movies on the phone so I can't tell you if the charge lasts longer in that respect.  All in all if you like the Galaxy S series I would recommend upgrading to the s7.":2016-07-27:Musicgirl63
Samsung Galaxy S7:UPGRADE FROM OLD PHONE:I BROUGHT THIS PHONE BECAUSE SAMSUNG HAS ALWAYS BEEN A GREAT PHONE FOR ME.:2016-07-27:SPICEY60

Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung S7 Galaxy SE:Like how fast it charges. Seems to use more battery juice than previous phone. Start at 98% AM and am at 28% by 4PM. Don't stream video. Just check-in on email, messages and FB. Maps if needed.  Love the photo quality but still not figured out how to see the photos in Gallery App.:2016-07-26:HBW16
Samsung Galaxy S7:Better than s4 in many ways:Trying to figure out some apps and location. . Overall I'm happy with the Matteson Illinois reps. That solve dilemmas easily:2016-07-26:Corkboi42
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great choice!:Great rear 12mp camera, pretty good front facing camera, loving the gold sleek frame and the sound quality is amazing. Only disappointment was the size...wish the phone was a little bit bigger.:2016-07-26:Nini2486
Samsung Galaxy S7:Comes in clutch:The fast charging the approximate time of fully charge was more accurate. And would like a notifications when the phone is completely charged it just shows red light from when you plug it in even when it's at 100%, or just shuts off no green light. Speak is not that strong But other then that had the phone just about 2 weeks and like it would recommend it:2016-07-26:
Samsung Galaxy S7:I do like the phone:It's not against the phone but galaxy has been missing a feature I miss from my galaxy s3.  The car mode where you can talk to your phone while driving send messages text etc:2016-07-26:Sherry1972
Samsung Galaxy S7:great phone but:I love this phone, it's very easy to use . My only complaint about it is the case, I got one of the charging cases, it's convenient but not great for someone who is clumsy. I dropped my phone in the parking lot the day after I got it, the case flew off in separate directions and didn't protect my phone at all.:2016-07-26:lala8lele
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone:Met expectations. I'm satisfied:2016-07-26:Pemrick792
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxay S7:I bought this phone and I am older and I don't understand a lot of options.  I don't like a book does not come with it and i have to take time to figure out on-line how to find what I want.:2016-07-25:Mary C
Samsung Galaxy S7:Transition from an S4 to a S7:I bought this a few weeks ago and find the changes mostly easily to transition.  The biggest complaint ( issue) I have with the newest Samsung is they have taken the frequent callers option on the home screen away.  It is now more steps to get to them.:2016-07-25:Nickieis
Samsung Galaxy S7:great phone:had this phone for 1 week now, adjusted to it very easily from a windows phone:2016-07-25:jmcopelec

Samsung Galaxy S7:well advanced phone:better than the iphones:2016-07-25:bama54
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good upgrade features from S5:I love the fingerprint security, works better than I expected it to.  I love the Samsung Pay which was not available on the S5.  Waterproof is nice, even though I haven't tested that.  I don't like the fact that I can't turn up the volume without the juvenile reminder that raising the volume can damage my ears.  I also haven't noticed a marked increase in battery life over the S5 as was promised.:2016-07-25:Peggers59
Samsung Galaxy S7:New but still familiar:Bought my S7 about a week ago, feels very similar to my old S5. The camera is awesome, and I would have given it 5 stars, but reception isn't very good on it.  Signal drops a lot, even when connecting to my home WiFi network for Internet access.  Happy with the other features, though.:2016-07-25:RangerGiselle
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the new S7:Love the phone. Some calls are not so clear. Some calls from friends won't connect at all. Not sure if the phone Verizon service:2016-07-25:Tair

Samsung Galaxy S7:Similar to tablet:Love features are similar to the tablet, like saving Internet pages.:2016-07-24:Judysapor
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice upgrade for Samsung, New to Verizon:Got a great deal at Target Mobile to switch to Verizon. Plus nice purchase incentives for the 7S.   Not quite clear on when the phone uses non wi fi data. It doesn't turn on automatically and can't seem to figure out the settings to adjust it. ALSO - I would have thought there would be a Verizon APP front and center to have access to all Verizon has to offer -verses uploading it later on. I have tried all the other major carriers .    From what I have seen of Verizon's website , I do like it and find it very user friendly. I have tried all the other major carriers .:2016-07-24:FLshopper

Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy S7:Bought it a week ago and at activation time it took two days to get messages to go to the phone. I miss the speech text that iPhone has. Other than that it's good.:2016-07-23:BGnJam
Samsung Galaxy S7:A new phone:I bought this a few weeks ago and have found it to be more than my android I had for 6 years. It is an update and certainly has more to offer than I know how to use. I am learning through trial and error, videos on how to, others helping me. I do enjoy it more than I thought. In time, I will do a lot more and look forward to it simplifying my life.:2016-07-23:cjm2
Samsung Galaxy S7:transion to S7 from S3:My S3 finally died so upgraded to the S7 good in my area 91351 but the real test will be how it works in Westlake Village, CA 91361..  My S3 was lucky to have 1 bar so hope the S7 will have a stronger signal.  Will test it tomorrow.:2016-07-23:Dar47
Samsung Galaxy S7:Does its job rather well:Bought it a few weeks ago, only complaints are the tempered glass screen protector don't cover the whole screen, and they didn't have the otter box defender series case in the store... and that's a staple of these kind of phonest, they really need the otterbox...:2016-07-23:King nothing bert

Samsung Galaxy S7:Hate grouped applications:It is a nice phone, however, I hate the grouped applications and do not really understand the text message features or options - it is more confusing than my S5.  Nevertheless, it serves my purpose of answering the phone.:2016-07-21:jshepperson2
Samsung Galaxy S7:I bought this product a week ago:Thanks for the great work that you all do:2016-07-21:Laquita Michelle

Samsung Galaxy S7:Works fast when needed:Got the new phone a week ago and still trying to get everything to work like i want it:2016-07-20:
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use:This has been a good transition phone for my mother in law.  Set up on easy mode has made it easy for her to use it without being overwhelmed with features.:2016-07-20:Redsharks
Samsung Galaxy S7:It was an easy transition from my S4:I got this phone when I switched to Verizon and it's a nice phone but not as fantastic as the reviews would lead you to believe.:2016-07-20:JoelBeebe
Samsung Galaxy S7:Quite similar so far to Galaxy S4:Still too new to me.:2016-07-20:walt44
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use!:I love my new phone!  It was an easy transition from my old phone, is light weight and easy to use!:2016-07-20:koch04
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Transition to the new phone ....:one month in and all is well:2016-07-20:RTE311
Samsung Galaxy S7:Verizon review:Phone is fine. Has lag sometimes on keyboard.:2016-07-20:Talltree
Samsung Galaxy S7:Most features are an improvement over my gs5, but some I don't like at all!!:It is more difficult to rename photos. It is horrific to figure out how to transfer photos from ph to computer. (Hours with tier 2 tech support and they still couldn't help). No longer has back up log on. Time consuming to have to swipe first, then use password. Wish they had white. Sound is louder. Speaker works (my gs5 never did).:2016-07-20:funsewfun
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the look:I am sure the reason that I am frustrated is that I had the old phone so long.  There are a lot of changes and upgrades that are great and I am sure that once I figure them all out I am going to love this new phone.  The photo quality is so much better than the S5 and I love the look.  It seems really easy to use and getting use to the differences are a pain but oh so much better than before.:2016-07-20:Donadee4u
Samsung Galaxy S7:Mys7:I've had it about 2 weeks and like it so far:2016-07-19:Lsteiny
Samsung Galaxy S7:New S7:I needed to get new phone. So far, so good.:2016-07-19:RawCassidy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Seems better than S5 but I think it's the network:Phone works really well but I am pretty sure a potato would work well on this network. Verizon is the best.:2016-07-19:Lunghi76
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Features, just wish the battery lasted longer, and didn't take so long to charge on a different charger than what it came with.:Bought this almost a week ago. Love the size, and love a lot of the features on it. Just wish the battery lasted longer, and that it would charge faster on a charging cord that didn't come with the phone. I have some 10 ft  long charger cords, and takes forever to charge my phone compared to other devices.:2016-07-19:Nvwest2012
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great performing smartphone:I wasn't in the market for a new phone, but when the charging port on my Note 4 got wrecked, I decided if I could upgrade, I'd get the latest and greatest Samsung phone. After about a week of having this, I know that was the right decision. It's a great Android device, syncing perfectly with everything I had right from the get-go. It's a smaller screen than I was used to, but nothing to complain about. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the battery can get REALLY hot with extended use. Certain media-heavy apps heat up the battery so much it's almost too warm to continue hanging on to. After a few minutes of downtime, though, it cools off. It also has an extremely long battery life (except when using Pokemon Go). It would be nice if the battery was more accessible in case I had to do any sort of manual shut off for issues that may arise, but it's something I can get over since I don't foresee issues anytime soon.:2016-07-19:genny18
Samsung Galaxy S7:I dont understand what you're looking for here.:"The device kept urging me to download messenger.  Thinking I had to have Messenger to receive messages thru Facebook, I did that. Now, every time someone texts me, I get 2 messages--one from the text and  one on Messenger.  Its  a nuisance to have to check each message twice. Also I was disappointed that several apps that were not ""factory"" apps  that I had downloaded myself did not transfer over from my old phone.  I lost the connection for my Fitbit, Uber, Zedge ringtones, etc.":2016-07-19:paddy1223
Samsung Galaxy S7:Sound quality could do with a upgrade and video less than what I thought from Samsung:Happy yes indeed. A GREAT PHONE!! NO QUESTION.:2016-07-19:Dagon
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phonenis pretty good:The samsung galaxy s7 and Iphone 6 both have their pros and cons. The iphone is a bit easier to use and get music on. The iphone also has the instant reply which I enjoyed. The samsung is a really fast phone and charges fast. The biggest reason why I got the Samsung Galaxy is for the micro sd card slot. The iphone simply didn't have enough space.:2016-07-19:Kjarcham
Samsung Galaxy S7:Sammy Does it Again:Great premium product, exceptional features, updated UI, preloaded with good apps.:2016-07-19:Ricardo7
Samsung Galaxy S7:A few basic problems:I'm having a difficult time touching on the letter and number pad exactly where I need to for them to work. Sometimes I have to press them hard and sometimes not. I'm going to need to go to the HELP page fairly often I think.:2016-07-18:MollieKH
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice. Capable fast:This is a business device. Will likely have few apps loaded and will be used mostly for email and photos. But it's nice. The Otterbein works well with it.:2016-07-18:Slide ruler
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition from my S6.:Have had my S7 about a week. The transition from my S6 has been pretty easy & I'm a tech novice. My only complaint is I was told my apps I had downloaded on my S6 would transfer over & the app did but my information (lists, memos etc) didn't. But that made it just like previous upgrades. Oddly, half of my contacts didn't transfer either. Other than this I really like my phone.:2016-07-18:Donaco
Samsung Galaxy S7:great phone:New and useful features to discover weekly:2016-07-18:ttfn92869
Samsung Galaxy S7:7165987657:I enjoy my new Samsung photo:2016-07-18:Carter5258
Samsung Galaxy S7:An easy transition.:If Samsung had come out with a newer Galaxy Mini I would have bought that, but now I'm glad that they didn't. This phone rocks and has all the features that I need. The single rough point is the transfer of some Smemo files from the s4. They showed up in the new phone but I have not yet been successful in opening them. I like the water resistance since I did once drown a phone. Overall I am very happy with this purchase and this may become a five star review after I get more used to the phone. Stay tuned!:2016-07-17:mountain southpaw
Samsung Galaxy S7:So far so good:Good battery life, great camera.:2016-07-17:newuser12a
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great platform, horrible battery.:I've had the phone now for 2 weeks and I love how easy it is to use and the platform it runs on. I also really like all the added features. However, the battery is absolutely terrible. It doesn't even last a whole day with medium usage.:2016-07-17:Cait_0622
Samsung Galaxy S7:Still getting used to it......:I'm enjoying this phone, but am still getting used to it.  For some reason the keyboard seems smaller or w/ a different sensitivity.  I am constantly making typos, and that was not the case on the last phone.:2016-07-16:vawright
Samsung Galaxy S7:Learning Curve:I like the additional features of my Samsung over my previous smartphone.  I'm slowly making the transition, but I can tell that I will be able to use it even more as a mini-computer while I'm on the go.:2016-07-16:emmachance
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone.:The galaxy 7 really hasorry no differences from the 6 other than the positioning of the lock button and camera so that I have to purchase a new case now.:2016-07-16:Detmer1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Getting used to it.:I bought the phone a week ago last Thursday.  After a few days, I was having issues.  Everyone said I was breaking up when I spoke with them on the phone.  While at work I kept getting a network error.  I was disappointed.  I was going to go back to the store.  Then I had a bright idea.  When in doubt, reboot.  That took care of everything.  My only complaint is that I lost my ringtones.  And trying to re-buy them is difficult.  A few things are different from my S3.  Overall, I really like my new phone!:2016-07-16:alexvdb
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung:I got this a few weeks ago and like it for the most part. Can't use Google maps. It tells me I'm off line when I'm not on WiFi.:2016-07-16:Cpankoni

Samsung Galaxy S7:Better phone than s5:This is a fast phone and seems very good. Still getting used to some of the app changes, but overall very happy.:2016-07-15:raquetballdon
Samsung Galaxy S7:needs complete instructions on how to work this phone:I would like to have some kind of instructions on how to use this new phone that I have. I'm completely lost on what it can do.  I need to know how all the apps work and how to send voice messages, and how to get the most out of my expensive phone.:2016-07-15:lee bee
Samsung Galaxy S7:Reliable Choice:It was time for my 2 year upgrade, so I selected the Galaxy S7 because I was afraid the Edge would be too fragile or complicated. I was searching for an upgrade to my S4 that wouldn't require me to learn a bunch of new stuff. I'm very pleased with the S7.:2016-07-15:theheatherly
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great camara:I have tried a few different carriers and Verizon seems to be one of the better ones:2016-07-15:Rickaromia
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the phone---but:I have had this phone for a week and so far I love it. The only downside is the battery life. I have to charge it every day..and I don't even use it a lot everyday.:2016-07-15:catlady4
Samsung Galaxy S7:New is GOOD:New devices always work at its peak.  In previous devices, the more apps you install, the slower the device becomes.  This new S7 will be tested.:2016-07-14:Laweo
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone and features.:Only downside has been getting contacts transfered from my old s5 to the new s7. Really like the s7 otherwise.:2016-07-14:Mike R
Samsung Galaxy S7:Decent upgrade:Only had the phone for a week, and I'm still adjusting to it. But so far it's a nice upgrade from my Samsung Galaxy S5.:2016-07-14:Bambarino71

Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy User:It was an easy transition from the Galaxy S5.  The battery life leaves a lot to be desired.  Does not last as long as I expected it should.:2016-07-14:susanc620
Samsung Galaxy S7:Practically Seamless Transition:A few apps did not transfer bit they were easily downloaded since the app store saved which apps I had previously installed.:2016-07-14:Mlam0726

Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition from my older model!:I really enjoy the phone. I've had it for about a week, and I like that my apps don't have any trouble running well.:2016-07-13:JGarcia21
Samsung Galaxy S7:Much the same as the S6:It is fine and works well:2016-07-13:Player2287
Samsung Galaxy S7:First Samsung I've ever had and I really enjoy it!:I love all the features on my new phone.  I've had a couple of other brand phones in the past, but was persuaded to try the Samsung S7.  What a great phone.  The only thing I miss is voice texting.  Maybe I just haven't found it yet!:2016-07-13:The General 1984
Samsung Galaxy S7:Looks great:I love the look and the new features:2016-07-13:Tristero49
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use:So far it's a great phonw:2016-07-13:Skullz
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's comparable to a lot out there:I bought this phone on the 4th, under the pretenses that it was the best. The salesman convinced me to buy this one instead of the HTC 10 I was looking at. I like the phone. The battery power isn't what he professed it to be, & there are a lot of apps I wish I could get rid of (a reason I was leaning toward the HTC) that have been sending a lot of ads. The photo quality is great, & the phone is splash proof (I haven't fully submerged it). Those were 2 characteristics I was definitely wanting in my new phone. I loved my former phone, the HTC M8 & was sold on the HTC 10 before I even got there, but after having the S7, I have to say they are very comparable. I am a tad disappointed in the battery life, & the screen has been unresponsive a few times while playing games. But overall, I do like the phone & it does handle everything I'm using it for, for the most part.:2016-07-12:Brainsnbeauty
Samsung Galaxy S7:Upgrade to S7:No problems on the upgrade, just a little bit of a learning curve getting used to the new features of the S7.:2016-07-12:DF454
Samsung Galaxy S7:I have never bought the newest latest and greatest phones but this phone is bang for your buck.:I bought my phone about 10 days ago and so far it has been great for what I need. The new features areally pretty straight forward and easy to maneuver. My one thing is that the phone is super slippery and me being a clutz, I already dropped it. The screen which is advertised as shatter resistant is not and the screen protectors that you can put over it don't do a thing!:2016-07-12:HG2011
Samsung Galaxy S7:Always a fan of android would never jump to the dark side of the apple:I got my S7 a week ago and i like it took some getting used to goin from a note 4. Not sure if my S7 has a glitch or what but when it's blacked out I hit the home button and nothing after a min or so it decides to open with the camera. I've also noticed the battery life is good but not as good as my note 4.:2016-07-12:Mikeb1951
Samsung Galaxy S7:love the new features, updated os:I dropped the phone taking it out of the shipping box and cracked the screen.  So much for tough water resistant qualities.:2016-07-12:Scurbow
Samsung Galaxy S7:Best phone ever!:Awesome phone, thanks Samsung:2016-07-12:Star_85
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition from my Motorola Droid:I just got the phone one week ago. I am still learning the many functions of the phone. I got the basic down and the phone Is user friendly. I like the fact that the battery last longer than my previous phone. I am not giving it a five star rating because I only had the phone for very short time:2016-07-12:duke tank
Samsung Galaxy S7:First Smart Phone:I am adjusting to my first smart phone. Many features that I like (i.e. conversation texting, email, apps). The three features that I don't like 1) the touch screen keyboard ( I prefer my old Samsung Zeal flip phone's real keyboard; 2) this phone is more fragile; and 3) the battery life compared to my old phone.:2016-07-12:Shineon409
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung s7:Bought the phone a week ago.  Happy with it so far.:2016-07-11:Bighib76
Samsung Galaxy S7:Would have been a 5:You can not move the apps ikon away from the edge. Other than that it's a good phone.:2016-07-11:Wrench567
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features, but battery issues:I bought this a few weeks ago and while it is a nice looking phone, the battery gets really hot and drains very quickly - in half the time that my old S5 did.:2016-07-11:Fortes27
Samsung Galaxy S7:Big upgrade from the S4!:Bought a week ago...love it!:2016-07-11:HFallllllll
Samsung Galaxy S7:Was an easy process:"I got my phone about 2 weeks ago, the only issue I have is that the battery doesn't last very long need to recharge every night by 5:00 pm phone is at 15% I'm at work all day so I don't use my phone very often. Not happy with battery life.":2016-07-11:Toni Doll
Samsung Galaxy S7:Miss my LG:"It's not bad, I bought the S7 for a 55"" TV promotion Verizon had going on. I don't hate the phone but were it not for the promise of a TV I'd have stuck to LG.":2016-07-11:TheOilyDuckling
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Features:Very easy transition from my previous phone. It seems as though the battery life is not all that great. Sometimes i need to charge it twice a day. I rarely use it when i am at work.:2016-07-11:Slinky116
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good features.  Still getting used to the updated phone.:I bought this phone a week ago.  Had some difficulties transferring the information from my old phone but the in store Verizon staff made it happen and were happy to help.:2016-07-11:karenchev

Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone:I don't like the glass screen cover that does not cover the whole screen but has gaps on the sides.:2016-07-10:Azuloaga
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone is definitely an upgrade from my S4:The S7 has great response time, and still getting used to all the features. maybe a little larger screen would have been better. So far so good.:2016-07-10:Rambo151
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy S7:After using Windows phones for years, I switched to this Android.  Still getting used to it, but general pleased.:2016-07-10:DeanNewSamsungGalaxyS7
Samsung Galaxy S7:Simple:There are loads of simple features that even a novice like me make it look easy.:2016-07-10:Mudchaser22
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the speed. But I some of the features of S5.:After 2+ years and some mishaps to my Galaxy S5 (a few drops in the field training [army field training] - the lifeproof case holds up to its claims) I love the speed and functionality of the S7 (to add, purchased a lifeproof case to step up the waterproof rate) but miss the IR feature of the S5 - used peel app for my audio/video equipment. Otherwise the S7 is sleek and photo phenomenal.:2016-07-10:T_Dub
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the upgrade!!:I bought this phone a week 2 weeks ago and I couldn't be happier! I thought I would need more than a 3 day weekend to transition from a Galaxy S4 to the new S7 but it was easy. The speed of the phone is amazing and I don't have anything bad to say!:2016-07-09:PharmTech4Life
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great:Great phone with great features. Fast. Terrific camera.:2016-07-09:Rayoman

Samsung Galaxy S7:good phone:I got this phone about week ago. Phone has some advance technical features such as fingerprint unlocking; however, it is missing some features such as lock screen banner.:2016-07-09:prasad1127
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy s7 best galaxy so far:I've had the S7 since release date and it's a great phone with loaded features including 4k photo/video. Love that Samsung brought back the external storage option and water resistant capabilities!! The only downside is have found is when service is low or out the battery drains very rapidly (less than 8 hours)... if there was a low network battery option fix then I would give 6 stars!! Overall a great device and very happy:2016-07-09:RaymondP07
Samsung Galaxy S7:All good except the screen proction from ZAGG:The switch from the S5 to the S7 was like I had the same phone I was used to but new and better. no learning time required:2016-07-09:Mike Carman
Samsung Galaxy S7:Pretty good:The S7 is pewrry decent but im dissapointed at how fast tje nattery discharges. Alrhougjt the fast charge feature counters that I dont wamt to be stuck to an pitlet all day.:2016-07-09:SHEDEAL
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Camera:Great phone, camera is awesome:2016-07-09:gmas30
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7 GALAXY:My S5 had a much better battery life even 2 years in. Besides that phone is compact and very easy to navigate and use.:2016-07-09:Jets1234
Samsung Galaxy S7:New phone:Overall Verizon experience,  satisfactory:2016-07-09:asbakerlmt
Samsung Galaxy S7:Many useful features. Impressed with range of capability.:I bought this phone as an upgrade for a flip open phone (pre-paid acct). Picture quality and resolution much better than our older phone.  I also like the wi-fi access and find that very useful.  This phone is worlds apart from non-smart phones.  The countless available apps are amazing - and it has video capability.  Texting is much better.:2016-07-08:TrainsGuy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use:Upgrade was due stayed with the Samsung:2016-07-08:Anniet
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone so far:I have had this phone for about a month.  The camera is great.  My only issue that it is really slow at txting photos and I seem to have to send the photo and then my txt that goes along with it and if I put more than one photo on one txt it may never be sent.:2016-07-08:megfjones57
Samsung Galaxy S7:galaxy S7:so far so good takes some getting used to seem like a few  more key strokes.:2016-07-08:realtor2016
Samsung Galaxy S7:good but frustrating:I have had the phone for two weeks now. I can not use the power saving mode as it will not allow the voice mail app to work, it affects Bluetooth connections and creates issues with Facebook and Facebook messenger apps. My only other compliant is that it will not allow me to set ringtones or notification other than the default on many of hte apps or contacts. Other than that the phone is pretty good, sound quality is better than my S5 and the 32 gig is great, the phone is not running out of space like the S5 did almost immediately.:2016-07-08:TriJedi
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone:Bought Samsung Galaxy S7 as an upgrade to an LG love it works great:2016-07-08:Dphipps98
Samsung Galaxy S7:Still in transition:Still learning about the features and the differences from old phone, but easy to figure out.:2016-07-08:Ann Marie
Samsung Galaxy S7:Decent transition:I hate having to get a new phone,  but this one was pretty easy to transition to.  The only thing that I don't really like is that I have to press harder on my screen for swipe:2016-07-08:Nbrockman
Samsung Galaxy S7:Makes tracking schedule easy:I bought this phone so I can keep better track of my schedule. It takes great photos and it is easy to set up your calendar.:2016-07-08:JohnEbgert13
Samsung Galaxy S7:Was due for up grade , like Samsung:Just have to adjust to the difference from old phone, Samsung 5:2016-07-08:Harleys mama
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesome, but:Jamming lightning fast phone. But the Bluetooth on the phone never would connect with my car. Verizon tried their best to help, but even the experts were stumped. So I got an IPhone, not as good, bummer for me. But at least it works with my car.:2016-07-08:JeffE1999
Samsung Galaxy S7:Best Galaxy Out There:I got this device 2 days before it was released because I preordered it, I also got a free gear s2 from preordering. The phone I will say only really needs a better battery, 6-8GBs of ram, and Micro USB-C to stay ahead of the competitors. I recommend this phone on the daily and I think it is a beautiful phone, Samsung gets better and better every year. I do really love the fact that you can upgrade every year with this phone as well, not saying that I will get tired of the phone or that I am not satisfied with it but I do know that all manufacturers are making all phones more expensive to buy and it is just nice to know you have all the options.:2016-07-07:CR112
Samsung Galaxy S7:I dig it.:Great phone. Exceptional camera. Good feel. Mediocre battery life if used frequently.:2016-07-07:Heimdallr
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Features! Love the extra space!!!:My only issues with this phone is that it gives me error messages when plugged into the pc for file transfers. There was also a small issue when I first started the droid with messages not coming in but once that was taken care of we are pretty good!!:2016-07-07:gogussy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good device - one main problem:This could be a great device. Almost identical to GS6 with more memory, speed, better battery. And also the return of SD Ram slot and water resistance.  I have one big problem, the screen.  The screen display should be it best feature but for some reason Samsung chose to give it a slight barely noticeable curve on the edges (I am not talking about the S7 Edge version of the phone).  This slight curve makes it impossible to get almost any tempered glass screen display to fit properly on this unit.  You have to choose between tempered glass which does not cover the width of the screen or you can go with some models that try to fit the full width but won't stick on the curved edges and will allow dust underneath.  This may seem like a minor complaint but this phone is too expensive to go without a screen protector and all the ones available for the phone don't fit.  GS6 does not have this issue because the screen is perfectly flat a tempered glass fits perfectly.  It is annoying to the point where I may consider returning it because I have a screen protector that doesn't cover the entire screen and it looks terrible.  Search for every screen protector for this phone and read the reviews for the screen protector.  They are mostly bad reviews because they don't cpover the screen or they do cover it but won't stick on the edges.  Turns out that it is not the fault of the screen protector, it is the fault of the screen designed by Samsung.:2016-07-07:mitch053
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice Phone:Still learning how to use all of the features but I like the phone.:2016-07-06:cjones1908
Samsung Galaxy S7:Getting used to new features. So far so good.:Got hacked shortly after buying new phone. Is there an anti virus built in?:2016-07-06:doublecreek
Samsung Galaxy S7:Reliable, except for speeds:My download speed is like a turtle.:2016-07-06:ABrit
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone... a little glitchy:All told the Galaxy 7 is a good phone. Good memory, fast processing and strong battery.   Have had a little glitchy experience with network related issues with text messaging but customer support worked hard to resolve.:2016-07-06:HMB3223
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, I got it for a couple of days now and I love it.:Phone is great. Good features, good size and long battery life. In addition I bought a cover case as well.:2016-07-06:Wilberino
Samsung Galaxy S7:great new phone but have to get used to it....:sometimes I love it - and sometimes I hate it - some of the ways you deal with the basics seem counterintuitive...but overall good. ;):2016-07-05:tammymcd
Samsung Galaxy S7:I would recommend this phone:I've had this phone for about a week. It's so much nicer to use than my old one, but am still trying to figure out how to get it to talk when I'm driving and get a text or call.:2016-07-05:lanahorton
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone set the standard for this category:Great performance, battery last almost a day and the charging is really fast, the screen resolution is really good under any circunstances.:2016-07-05:MisaelE
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung S7:Transitioning from an iPhone. So far so good...Still learning:2016-07-05:Betty O
Samsung Galaxy S7:Cell Phone:I like everything except texting.  It seems to have a mind of it's own -auto-corrct.:2016-07-05:HollyH
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition to a new company and product.:Left a former company whom did not know information about their product. I have been with Verizon almost a month. Still learning, yet so far I am pleased with them.:2016-07-04:DeniseG68
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features. Sound needs improving. Great phone over all!:Really easy to use and customize.  User friendly and very thought out options. Thank you Samsung!:2016-07-04:JackJordanCA
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition and a much more durable phone:I love the phone, the case, the water-resistance and the protection in case it's dropped:2016-07-04:beachpaula
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone; time-consuming transition:The GS7 has great features, and does pretty much everything as well as or better than my prior phone, the GS5 (the only tech glitch on the GS7 is a strange echo in the sound portion on a few apps; I need to figure out which of the other apps is causing this, as that seems to be the likely culprit, based on some initial research).  Porting over all my data and apps took quite a while (nearly 3 hours!), and not everything came over.  Samsung needs to get their act together in this respect -- the direct data transfer software is slow and glitchy.  Also -- Samsung -- I'm very, very unhappy that the battery is not removeable.  There's no legit reason for that.  I almost didn't buy this phone for that reason alone, and next time, it'll be a deal-breaker.:2016-07-04:LODJA
Samsung Galaxy S7:4063709367:Battery life is horrible But overall is just like the s5 and s6 which I like:2016-07-04:Ashley3853
Samsung Galaxy S7:I bought this product a week ago,  and I am very pleased with it.:I like the opportunity to get acquainted  to the device & seek customer service for all other options.:2016-07-03:Bigger51
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features pool data transfer:So far, the phone itself is all I expected it to be.   The transfer of the apps, their data, my files, and my login information was far from satisfactory.  No login info was transferred.  Some, not all apps were transferred.  App data seems to have been mostly transferred, but not visible until login is achieved.  Make sure you have all your passwords available to you.:2016-07-03:EEWoos
Samsung Galaxy S7:Difficult transition from window phone.  Calendar week display is difficult to view compared to seven daily windows on window phone.:Display kept flashing on with ads, etc. until I locked.  Still getting unwanted ads.  Ran up over 1 Gig of data charges without my knowledge.:2016-07-03:Rapid Robert
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very fast and easy to operate:I had the S4. Huge difference.  Very fast and easy to navigate.  My phone though dose not work with headphones.  I need to bring it back and have it checked:2016-07-03:Kari68
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung is as good as ever.:Impressive performance and features. Carrier apps that cannot be installed are annoying.:2016-07-02:cjpurifoy3686
Samsung Galaxy S7:Work great. Much better than the 5:Very glad I made the upgrade.:2016-07-02:Jafahorse
Samsung Galaxy S7:Still learning:I just got last week and had issues with first one.  Got to take it in to Verizon and get a new one.  So still learning everything on the phone.:2016-07-02:1111ballerina

Samsung Galaxy S7:one app is driving me crazy:i do occasionally use text messaging, but not whiile i am driving. the message that my friends receive most of the time is that i an driving and cannot answer their messae. this occurs even when i am at home. i am unable to locate a way to turn this app off.:2016-07-02:cute southern mamma

Samsung Galaxy S7:So much better than my Iphone5!:I love the ease of use.  The phone gets warm quickly but other than that it is awesome!:2016-07-01:Phoney051
Samsung Galaxy S7:Like the new features, transition was easier than the past experiences.:Bought 2 of the S7's around a month ago for wife and myself. We both like the quality.:2016-07-01:jerkyman2
Samsung Galaxy S7:Everything is good except keyboard is small:Phone functions well except keyboard. Large fingers cause mistakes:2016-07-01:Stuart52
Samsung Galaxy S7:pretty phone:I like the way the phone feels, the size and look of it.  I'm still trying to figure things out, I wish I had gone to the Samsung center for orientation in Best Buy.  I may go back and do that.:2016-07-01:sgb64
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy Transition:I bought this phone about a week ago and I wish that I got the Galaxy S7 Edge!:2016-07-01:973258
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use!:I like it, I just worry it heats too much when it's charging.:2016-07-01:LeBe
Samsung Galaxy S7:The good and the not so good:"Upgraded from the Galaxy S4.  Hated not having a user removable battery and the left hot button being changed from ""Menu"" to ""Switch/Close Application"".  Higher speed, water resistance,  better camera, a little bit bigger display, and longer battery (my old one was reallygetting tired) were nice improvements.":2016-07-01:fa18mhr
Samsung Galaxy S7:Switched from Apple.  Not going back:Love this phone so far! I've only had it for a few weeks, so I was hesitant to give it fie stars.  I was an apple user that needed a more technical device.  This phone definitely takes some time to mess with and understand the system workings, but each new feature I discover seems brilliant! (like the screenshot swipe! love it).  I am highly satisfied.  My only complaint is that the phone only comes with the supercharge accessories (these allow a full charge in about an hour). And that isn't too severe a complaint.  The battery normally lasts all day.:2016-07-01:Shop Girl
Samsung Galaxy S7:Based on past Samsung experience I'm going to love it:Still learning the ins and outs. Contact list set-up is great, camera is great.  USER has fewer tech skills since retiring!! LOL:2016-06-30:JoJo2

Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy 7:I had my old Samsung Galaxy crappie out.  Impressed with speed and the new features:2016-06-29:Blue44130
Samsung Galaxy S7:It is difficult to get used to:I have only had the phone for a week.  Things are much harder to find than my old flip phone.:2016-06-29:ssteelguy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Sam:After phone has been turned off, and then turned back on after awhile, it does not always bring up the email messages that were missed.:2016-06-29:Kobey
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition from my other phone.:Just got the phone on the 12th June, and I really enjoy it.:2016-06-29:KeKe5
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy S7:Had the phone about a week. Love how clear the text is on Facebook,  etc. But having trouble reading email,  very small font.  Phone is noticeably heavier than the S5 I had, which I don't like. Miss some of the features on the clock and phone or in just haven't figured it out yet. Also, why is voice mail so difficult? If i had it to do ovet again, not sure I would have made the same choice.:2016-06-29:Sassee64
Samsung Galaxy S7:was easy to learn:good phone with many options:2016-06-29:cr2449
Samsung Galaxy S7:Undecided:I brought the phone a week ago and I like the phone but I'm having a hard time with the volume:2016-06-29:Shawn8415
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very similar to the S6.:I haven't found a big difference between the Galaxy S6 and this S7. I do hope theverything waterproof feature is as accurate as advertised.  It's a very nice phone and easy to use.  I wish the camera was as nice as other newer phones.:2016-06-28:Anglincpr
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition:Works per specification:2016-06-28:Lindberg
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it so far!:This was an upgrade from my S4. I love the larger size, faster speed and that it's waterproof. I have the gold one and notice that it does get a little warm during extended periods of use. Not sure if it's because of the metal vs plastic or not, but still love this phone!:2016-06-28:Myphonenotyours
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone.  Doesn't sync well with Gear watch.:If I had known there were going to be so many problems syncing with my Gear, I wouldn't have purchased the upgrade. I like the new emoticons.:2016-06-28:pianogirl1905
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Features:I've had it for two weeks and still getting accustomed to it.:2016-06-28:Bradb821
Samsung Galaxy S7:s7 review:I was disappointed that watching the help videos and getting an operating system update used up my data.:2016-06-28:jjyo
Samsung Galaxy S7:great phone:i just got this phone a week ago, i really like the camera, phone runs great still getting used to some of the features:2016-06-28:Carcoul
Samsung Galaxy S7:Satisfied with phone:Crystal clear display of images, screens,and audio. Very satisfied with battery life. Not quite as satisfied with user interface. Navigation thru screens takes too many clicks.:2016-06-28:Jim A
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good features  but also some downfalls:Like the features but accessibility is a pain from the front screen:2016-06-28:Basquo
Samsung Galaxy S7:Still learning...:Working group on learning features:2016-06-28:Dear5
Samsung Galaxy S7:Too much bloat:This phone has so much stuff on it that is unnecessary and you can't get rid of it. There are some things that are difficult to understand.:2016-06-28:dmt2016
Samsung Galaxy S7:Meets Expectations With One Exception:The phone is nicely designed and delivers all the features promised.  I was disappointed to find that the Infra-Red transmitter was dropped in this upgrade.  How am I supposed to override my wife's TV channel selection?  I'm pretty sure the S6 still had the IR function.:2016-06-28:HawkFan4Life
Samsung Galaxy S7:Improvement over S6, but...:Improvement over S6. Brought back SD card and water resistance. Still cannot replace battery and I did not want or need a glass back (just something else to break).:2016-06-27:Waterlogged59
Samsung Galaxy S7:"32GB onboard + additional SD Card slot  :)":I have been using it the S7 a few months and NO problems like my old Samsung S5 that was ALWAYS out of internal space.  The camera takes amazing pictures. Be sure to get a case as it is very slippery without one.  I use the tech21 as it is very slim:2016-06-27:Computer_Dr
Samsung Galaxy S7:New technology:I bought this to replace my apple 5s phone as it got wet and the new feature of being able to spill on this phone and it will keep working intrigued me.:2016-06-27:Walker96
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very, very nice:I have had this phone for about two weeks, upgrading from a Samsung 5s.  The new phone operating system is more user friendly, the screen is very sharp with vivid colors, the phone junction itself is great, with more volume and clearer tones.  The only issue that I find is the battery life.  It is better than the 5s, but in my opinion, still not good enough.  But for that, I would give this phone 5 stars.:2016-06-27:Kadufkis
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great screen clarity..:I had an iPhone and the transition to the Samsung was pretty easy. I enjoy using Google play. My only complaint is that I can't turn off data usage for individual  apps.:2016-06-27:Silvie133
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone has glitches and kicks me off sites.:Bought this phone about 2 weeks ago. Decided to try the Samsung S7 due to the camera. Quality of the camera is great! However, the phone continously kicks me off of certain sites such as Facebook and games. I eventually get so frusterated of having to reopen my apps that I just give up!!:2016-06-27:Annie34
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7 computer/phone:I enjoy the phone but, battery life is still an issue for Samsungs...:2016-06-27:SkipRoller
Samsung Galaxy S7:Has great features and is easy to use.:Had the phone for a couple of weeks now and it works great. It operates quickly and does not freeze when multi tasking.:2016-06-27:JQ47
Samsung Galaxy S7:It was easy to switch to this phone:I hoped that the battery would last longer on this phone, but it hasn't done so.:2016-06-27:Pegasus feathers
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use and search:Love it like it too much:2016-06-27:Debberdo08
Samsung Galaxy S7:OK phone, not great.:Phone calls not as good as Motorola. People I call or who call me say the sound quality is terrible. Volume could be louder. Some dropped calls.:2016-06-27:Engine245
Samsung Galaxy S7:New galaxy s7:Wanted to update to new phone went from s5 to s7 skipped the s6 because s7 had the SD card slot:2016-06-27:Megskin94
Samsung Galaxy S7:I'm not text savy but between Best But and my son I'm learning fast.:I waited till my son got his to see how he liked it.  I asked him not long after and he was happy with his, so I bought mine.:2016-06-27:rmschwer
Samsung Galaxy S7:Transistion was done by Costco employee, however, very disapointed.:I bought this phone a month ago and I am still trying to get it back to my preferred settings like my old S5.  Now wish I never upgraded to the new phone.  For what I use it for there is no need for the upgraded features and hassle of fixing everything..:2016-06-27:Disapointed 1million
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung again!:Just updated to the 7 and Samsung again brings me good pics, easy use and plenty of options.:2016-06-27:CC64

Samsung Galaxy S7:Wireless charging of 5he Samsung s7 is great ! No more fighting and damaging the charging port.:It has been two weeks and wits a mophie charging case  the battery life last past a typical work day:2016-06-26:RickV3792
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it:Bought it for my girlfriend and she loves it. Nothing really wrong with this phone, except the battery life is not that great.:2016-06-26:Tj199
Samsung Galaxy S7:Hard to go from Droid to Samsung Galaxy:I love the camera and the ease of viewing the screen even on a bright day with my sun glasses.  Having trouble getting the text notifications to work on message+.:2016-06-25:lablover17
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7:Love camera. Takes wonderful pi9:2016-06-25:Jimhedwig
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone. but i have an issue.:The phone is great. Same as the S5 i replace except for the brighter screen and more onboard memory. Unfortunately, I wake up one week later and now I have a line running down the side of my screen. Not good. Heading back to the store tonight.:2016-06-25:Bigbaddad924
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:Good battery life, and storage.:2016-06-25:Ginfield
Samsung Galaxy S7:Fairly easy transition:I bought the Samsung Edge instead of the iPhone to replace my 5 year old iPhone because I wanted a better camera, bigger screen, and a promotional virtual reality headset.  It has all I hoped for but the transition has been a little more difficult than I thought.  After owning it for a week, I feel like I'm finally getting the hang of it.  I do NOT like the split screen option because it keeps popping up when I don't want it. But it is slightly bigger than my old phone (which I like) and it's faster and easy to use (once you get used to the difference from an iPhone).:2016-06-25:txgal2016
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone:Like it a lot would recommend it.:2016-06-24:Pop Pop Bernie
Samsung Galaxy S7:Like it very much.:Love the new feature of fingerprint ID. The rest of the features are much the same as my Samsung Galaxy S4- at least as far as I've discovered so far.:2016-06-24:MartyNC
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice upgrade:I liked my galaxy 5 and the galaxy 7 is just as good with a better camera and other nice features:2016-06-24:fancyfingers85
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition nice upgraded features:I had the S5 and I like the upgraded features and the new ones as well.:2016-06-24:ngoldman80
Samsung Galaxy S7:still learning about Smart Phones...:"I finally joined the world of ""smart phones""  and am still learning the features of this phone.  Generally it's quite intuitive and easy, it just takes a little getting used to since I was used to a much older phone.":2016-06-24:GB from Nebraska
Samsung Galaxy S7:Svelte Intuitive  battery hog:Not as dramatic an improvement over Motorola Droid Maxx. Battery drain actually worse, reception similar. Easier to handle. Speed reasonable but not significantly faster.:2016-06-24:Catalyst4744
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition:Bought the S7 to replace a dying S3. Love it.:2016-06-23:rayznana
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone.:Had it for two weeks. A few features such as playing music I'm a little upset with, not the same as the 6s. But overall pleased with the phone.:2016-06-23:ASB1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone with better reception than my older one.:I am enjoying my new phone and it's features.:2016-06-23:User0102
Samsung Galaxy S7:Packed with features:I do love my new smart phone, but the transition from a flip phone is a steep learning curve. Some things which should be obvious seem to me hard to find, like how to turn off all noise temporarily. Notifications, phone, etc. Also buying just the basic accessories added up to quite a bit. I bought a case, screen protector and wireless charger so far.:2016-06-23:Janet43
Samsung Galaxy S7:Only one thing wrong:The only thing I have found wrong with the S7 compared to my note 3 is that the S7 doesn't have an IR reader in it. I used the note 3 with my TV all the time and can't do that with the S7:2016-06-23:Thigpen
Samsung Galaxy S7:not enough instructions for all the features:would like a short booklet showing the features and how to use them.:2016-06-23:jeanne59
Samsung Galaxy S7:battery life is horrible:I like the phones features, I like that it is waterproof. But the battery life is horrible for me. And I mostly use my phone for calling and texting. I use very little data around 1 gig per mounth.:2016-06-23:jdcarpenter
Samsung Galaxy S7:So far so good:So far so good. Better than. My 5s:2016-06-22:Robbie_d_va
Samsung Galaxy S7:So fast and good battery life:The screen is smaller than my Note 4 but it is a trade off I am happy to give for the fast processing, better signal and better battery life.:2016-06-22:Kmcginty
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, updated, super fast with an annoying flaw.:Great phone, upgrade from my S5 that I loved. Everything runs amazingly fast! It has a crisp user interface, TouchWiz is less annoying in fact better than native Google options at this point. Samsung even has me enjoying there Web browser over chrome or Firefox. I have 2 issues however with the build of the phone physically. The speaker is in an annoying spot and easily muffled by how I naturally hold my phone in landscape as well as portrait. 1 other issue is the screen glass has a slight bevel to it. In itself that is fine but when trying to find a screen protector solution it is HORRIBLE! I've tried a few options and have yet to find a protector that can cover the entire exposed glass edge to edge and not lose sensitivity. Hopefully i will find a good fit soon. With my s5 having a flat screen it was simple and worked PERFECT. Aside from those things the phone is amazing and would still purchase it against the devices available today. Overall very very pleased!:2016-06-22:tsnap20
Samsung Galaxy S7:Overall, I like the S7:I went from the S5 to S7 and the transition was smooth.  There are some neat new features that make some tasks easier. The phone app has a better layout and I like that I can see the date and time (and notifications) with my phone off.  It's lighter than my old phone and apps are easier to manage.  I am disappointed in that some things seem to load slowly and sometimes not at all (vidoes).:2016-06-22:lisalogic
Samsung Galaxy S7:Excellent fit for my needs:"This device  (Samsung Galaxy G7) is like having a small portable laptop with a ""phone ""attached to it":2016-06-22:Misfit822
Samsung Galaxy S7:Surprisingly happy:I have a love hate relationship with cell phones, well really I mostly hate them. This is the first cell phone I'm actually enjoying using. It is fast, the battery lasts, the interface is just like my Samsung tablet so it makes sense to me.:2016-06-22:chris117
Samsung Galaxy S7:perfect fit for my hands  much better size:S7 is a great phone.  Much better than the S5 I had.  A bit touchy on the screen and slippery to hold but super video and pics.  Very easy to use.:2016-06-22:alscats
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:Very happy I picked this phone:2016-06-22:jlk464
Samsung Galaxy S7:New phone learning:I have had the phone about a week now. So far all is good still learning the new features. Much of it is truly good. Still i am alittle concerned with battery life. I am going to give it a couple more full charges to see if it improves.:2016-06-21:Grumpynorm811
Samsung Galaxy S7:Amazing transfer:Love it still figuring it out though:2016-06-21:Sweetjay
Samsung Galaxy S7:easy to use:I just upgrade from a S4 to S7. Transition was was easy. A lot of features were easy to use. Over all I am satisfied with the new S7.:2016-06-21:pulman14
Samsung Galaxy S7:Impressive phone:I upgraded from an S3 to the S7, and a lot of changes have been made, so I'm still getting familiar with the S7.  For the most part, I think it's a much better phone.  It's shortcomings to this point may just be my lack of familiarity.  The battery life is much better.:2016-06-21:Uncle Jeff
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, fast and fun features:Upgraded from perfectly fine phone to get advanced calling and Wifi calling, waterproofing and design sold me above the others. Size is not the huge phablet that most seem to be going to and screen is great. Only downside do far is the lowest part of the screen is a little iffy when selecting things, pain as the keyboard lives their:2016-06-21:Nickname rules are crazy
Samsung Galaxy S7:good phone but no better than my older phone:phone is very much like my other phone ,has better camra but not that much better. I should have kept my other phone so much alike. updated because I thought batery life would be better and it is worse.Not at all happy about that.Sometimes people can not hear me when we talk.:2016-06-21:me2291
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition to new phone:Only had the phone a week...Happy the features are almost the same:2016-06-20:Rreett
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung S7:"I bought the phone 2 weeks ago and in general it's nice but too many new bells and whistles. We are currently having issues with Bluetooth with my wife's hearing aid ""Streamer"" and the car Blue tooth. we had a Samsung S3 before and never really had any issues":2016-06-20:Donnh
Samsung Galaxy S7:I'm glad for the standard 32gb of storage:I have tried to keep the S7 working like my S4, but I am glad for the extra storage because that was my biggest problem with the S4.:2016-06-20:Jdegroot9
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung S7:Great phone. Haven't tried out the water proof feature yet.:2016-06-20:Meganj428
Samsung Galaxy S7:Similar:I bought the next Galaxy and it seems very similarge to the last. The one improvement I've noticed is the battery. It will last all day plus have a good amount left.:2016-06-20:KaTara1125
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone but poor voice commands:"I like pretty much everything about this phone except for ""S-Voice"" which is Samsung's version of Motorola's Moto Voice and OK Google. Half the time it won't recognize my voice, and even when it does the info isn't very useful. I switched to OK Google after a few frustrating days. Moto Voice is excellent, and something I really miss about my Droid.  Multiple emoji sets (Samsung, Verizon) make it impossible to choose emojis in text messages because they're always different. In Verizon's messaging app, the keyboard shows one emoji, but what gets put in the text message looks completely different.":2016-06-20:Uncle Marty
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung S7:Just bought phone. Appears to be what I wanted:2016-06-20:Ray9
Samsung Galaxy S7:Note 5 to Galaxy 7:Great phone just have to get used to the smaller screen especially when watching Netflix or Hulu on it, but convenient that I can put in my pocket without a huge bulge!:2016-06-20:Princela88
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to go from Iphone to Galaxy S7:Got this a couple of week ago and am happy with the move. I was worried this would be a hard move after having an IPhone for 5 years, but it wasn't bad at all.:2016-06-20:gjdude
Samsung Galaxy S7:Some great features but also some problems.:I've had it freeze up once -but got it back.  My fingerprint ID didn't work well so I removed it.  the protective cover on the front doesn't cover the whole screen like my 4S did.  I'd like it to cover all so stuff doesn't get in between.:2016-06-19:Caroleander
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features! Easy to use!:Love this phone. Love the new cloud feature however it does fill up fast. Only reason for a 4  star review was the battery life isn't what I thought that would be.:2016-06-19:3966
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone annoying pop up ads:I bought this a week ago.  Get phone but I'm getting pop up ads.:2016-06-19:Gnat1076

Samsung Galaxy S7:good with great camera:Phone transition was smooth and the features of the S7 are very satisfactory. Brighter screen and new generation camera are plusses. being able to read screen outdoors is great.:2016-06-19:Lartco
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, overall very happy with Galaxy S7:I like the smaller size, it is easier for me to manage. Never fun going to a smaller screen, but anything can be zoomed in so the trade off was worth it. Samsung is an easy system to get used to. I am anti-Apple so the iPhone was not an option.:2016-06-18:ArleneD
Samsung Galaxy S7:The only problem for me is battery life, it is better then the 6 but still wish it would last longer. Also wouldn't mind if it was just a bit bigger .:Overall I like this phone, changes I would make- removable battery,  larger screen and longer battery life, especially since I can't change to another one.:2016-06-18:Marthac555
Samsung Galaxy S7:easy to use:changed from another service provider and am getting great customer support:2016-06-18:Kathy0000999
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone.:I bought the Samsung Galaxy S7 about a month ago and have been extremely pleased with it and it's features.  Everything is where it should be.  Unlike most other phones, Samsung has maintained the physical button.  Which is something I like.  The screen size is great and extremely clear.    I only have one issue.  The audio has a slight buzz, but hopefully this will be corrected by the warranty.:2016-06-18:BSH01
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it:I've had the s3, s5 and now the s7 and the s7 is by far the best:2016-06-18:Hipabby101
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it but need to learn it:I love my new phone. I only have one issue and that is the wifi option. I have used a lot of my data because the wifi doesn't automatically connect.  I have much to learn:2016-06-17:Rhondalin
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love everything Except calling (4G/LTE) issues:The phone and apps are awesome.  Love the camera capabilities and the S Health app is great.  Just make sure that Verizon ensures that your new Galaxy S7 can also function on the 1X towers.  4G/LTE coverage has been spotty at best, even in metro Charleston.:2016-06-17:Ferndell
Samsung Galaxy S7:What I think:Adjusting to new phone was easier than anticipated:2016-06-17:mab12
Samsung Galaxy S7:This is what I think...:This is an Android, which is Google.  I have had my problems with Android and my last phone was a Galaxie S 5.  I am already having some of the same problems with this new S7.  My S 5 had some real problems, not sure whether it was the electronics or the software, no one could seem to tell me.  This one is much better, but a few of the little issues are still there.:2016-06-17:No name so there
Samsung Galaxy S7:Was so easy to get this phone:Awesome phone in all things:2016-06-17:Zman14
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung S7:"Don't like that Alarm names are limited to 20 characters.  My old S3 allowed many more characters for Alarm names.  Also miss the functionality of the ""button"" to the left of the Main button.":2016-06-17:davidbowieisdead
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features and it's very fast via WiFi.:Bought it a week ago. Very pleased.:2016-06-17:Mmp26
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy Transition:I had the S5 before, and it was a very easy transition. It functions about the same with some fun extra features.:2016-06-17:Scottc001
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone:Transition from my Galaxy S5 was not too smooth.  Lost pictures, some apps.  Battery seems to run down quickly.:2016-06-16:rodayho
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features but not very intuitive:I like the sleek design and interface, but some of the features take a little longer to figure out than expected. Overall, I like it.:2016-06-16:janegogo
Samsung Galaxy S7:still learning, keeping it simple for now:"looking forward to opportunity to participate in ""Tutorial"" (classes) to learn more features and how to use the phone & do more with it.":2016-06-16:JudyRod
Samsung Galaxy S7:I like it:Only had it for a week so far so good still leaning:2016-06-16:Ozzie24
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone one small problem:I love everything about the S7. All the features are awesome. However, I've been a Motorola Droid guy for a long time, and there is no comparison of battery life. If SAMSUNG can fix this issue. This phone is a grand slam.:2016-06-16:Lonerider_DOC
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great:I bought it I love the phone but I'm having issues with the screen protector that was sold by verizon its not fitting:2016-06-16:Gabeviv
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features, challenging transition from a Windows Phone:I bought this phone b/c Microsoft and Verizon can't seem to come to terms regarding Windows Mobile Phones, and I had just broken my Nokia Lumia 928.  While having access to a ton of apps that I didn't have access to before has been great, not being able to edit my Outlook.com Contacts so that my contacts are all in one place whether on my phone or on the computer has proven very disappointing.  I know I can do this with a Google account and it work the same as it did with my Outlook account, but I am just too interdependent with Outlook to transition.  Hardware-wise, the phone is very good.  I do find that the wireless antenna is not as good as my previous phone, and I find the phone dropping calls in areas where it didn't have that problem with my old phone.:2016-06-15:Dante35
Samsung Galaxy S7:"Easier than expected :-)":Phone is great...transition from Windows to Android a bit of a challenge for a couple of days.  Better explanation in Help for key functions perhaps would have been good.:2016-06-15:msvickinc
Samsung Galaxy S7:Still deciding:I upgraded from the S5 to S7 primarily because I heard the pictures were better quality .The issue is that the quality of videos are still not good when sending in a text , still pixelates and distorts .  Also some of the features with contacts and lock screen are not with the S7. I do like that the video posting on  fb has better quality.   The screen size is a little bigger too and that's good.:2016-06-15:Divamom50
Samsung Galaxy S7:Close to my old Droid Turbo:Getting used to it....:2016-06-15:RonKj
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung S 7:Good phone. Had camera issues with the first one. Second is much better. Great all around device.:2016-06-15:Almighty Atlas
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, must try:Best phone on the market to date:2016-06-15:Pedro12
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone needs:I got this phone after the Galaxy S4 but there are a few hiccups with this phone but that is to be expected when you get the latest phone.  So I hope as the months move along that they fix them.:2016-06-15:NEO0062005
Samsung Galaxy S7:Edge screen, 4k quad hd display, screen size features!:Amazing over all phone with most minimum problem(s).:2016-06-15:Rio21
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good features, not all data transferred from my previous phone.:Overall I'm enjoying the new phone. Lots of changes navigating apps from my Galaxy SIII. It seems it takes more steps to do things than before but like the fast loading and transitioning between apps.:2016-06-15:MurDog727
Samsung Galaxy S7:Ease of use:Just getting familiar with phone, switching from flip phone is a bit of a change for the better.:2016-06-14:Tooty fruity
Samsung Galaxy S7:Pretty good:Nice features. Sleek. Good for games.:2016-06-14:KlmnW
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transfer:Just got this phone a week ago. Easy to use.:2016-06-14:Cjgross4903
Samsung Galaxy S7:I like it so far. Needed upgrade from my Galaxy 4. Still learning all the ways around the apps and how they have changes.:I do like some of the new features as this was a big changes from my Galaxy 4. Still learning my way around the phone and I have not really played too much with the camera yet. I will get a better chance to review how this phone will manage my roaming out of the country compared to my previous Galaxy. I knew of all the apps and applications to monitor and shut down to keep my charges low. This will be the real good test and a learning curve. Like it so far.:2016-06-14:tgiulianelli
Samsung Galaxy S7:New phone lots of new features:Had this phone for 2 weeks, still trying to figure some of it out:2016-06-14:diana7w
Samsung Galaxy S7:So Far So Good:Had to upgrade.  Still learning but seems ok:2016-06-14:reading13
Samsung Galaxy S7:Excellent phone - battery life not so much but...:Awesome phone, great features and with Marshmallow, the best. My only don't-like-so-much is the battery life. Coming from a Droid Turbo I was used to more than a day of charge without finding a charger. That said there is the quick charge, and this nifty feature of Ultra Power Saving Mode, which enables one to put it into very minimal battery use with essential notifications and apps on a simple grey scale screen. When I don't need more than simple web browsing, phone, text message interaction it really saves battery.  Turning it on and off is simple making it very convenient to extend my charge for more than a day.  Held up well during a recent 35 mile bike ride with fitness tracking, GPS, Bluetooth all enabled for the duration and I still had 50% battery left after.:2016-06-14:JMe61
Samsung Galaxy S7:Same basic features but lots of transition trouble.:I bought this phone a week ago because of battery problems with my S4. My contacts pulled over fine but my pictures were jumbled and wouldn't sort them by date taken so I had to divide 650 pictures into albums. My APPs pulled over but had to be re-approved and I'm still working on setting many of them up with passwords, IP addresses, ports, ect. Emails seem easier to handle and the battery is lasting all day (so far).:2016-06-13:Senior Chief
Samsung Galaxy S7:Still getting used to it.:Going from a S4 to a S7 I'm still trying to get used to all the new functions.....:2016-06-13:Lisa wiley
Samsung Galaxy S7:Definitely a step up from my s5:I've only had my s7 for about a week, but I love it. The camera is so much better. The low light camera is fantastic. You can't even tell they were taken in low light.:2016-06-13:KellLaKell
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone, but not really different from S5:I am enjoying my new phone, but I was expecting a better battery life, based on the advertisements.:2016-06-13:Polinka
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very Much Improved from earlier models..:The service at Target where I bought the phone was excellent. They had to get on the phone with Verizon for a quick question and it was handled very professionally.:2016-06-13:wwgiovanni
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great screen quality:I love how bright and clear the screen and pictures are.  I just wish the battery was a little better.:2016-06-13:Shannon315
Samsung Galaxy S7:I prefer the larger screen of the Note 3 I used to have. No zoom on this new phone. This new one seems to be better engineered. It'seems easier to us.:Screen is too small.:2016-06-13:Nonicky
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's not bad:It will freeze and not go to the next screen.  Sometimes in different apps or situations it won't even let me click the button. Just freezes:2016-06-13:Heatherann74
Samsung Galaxy S7:Mom's phone:Good phone so far it's fast:2016-06-12:DanielMarie phone
Samsung Galaxy S7:Greatdealofcapabilities:Replaced my galaxy S4:2016-06-12:Mainframe Dinosaur
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy S7 Review:I just bought the S7, and it has all the features I need in a smartphone, and is also light and has a smooth touch.  For me, all the built-in notification sounds available could be a bit louder, as most of them are harder to hear depending on where one is.:2016-06-12:mopc
Samsung Galaxy S7:Ex-iPhone owner and very happy:Just switched from an iPhone 5s, love the Samsung's features, tons of memory and expandable if I want too!! , intuitive features, awesome display, amazing low light camera,(amateur photographer), waterproof, perfect size, gives u a sense of control and freedom that I was missing with the iPhone..this feels like my phone noto something that I borrowed from apple... anyway so far very happy with it, wish longer battery life and I'm exploring app integration with other platforms so far so good. Go for it.:2016-06-12:Farcisco

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features!:I bought the product a fortnight ago and it has consolidated functionality.:2016-06-12:Muuya
Samsung Galaxy S7:Compared to s6?:I like the Samsung Galaxy. There is no comparison between the old iPhone I had & my s6. But for the 1st time ever, I dropped my s6 & had to get a new phone. I thought I would upgrade to the s7 since I had been so happy with the s6. I have yet to discover any upgrades. In fact, one of the most important things to me was the fantastic camera in my s6. I don't think the camera is near as good in the s7. It doesn't seem to zoom as good & the clarity isn't as good either. Everything else seems to be just the same.:2016-06-12:Cool Breeze Kate
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love this phone, except...:I just got this phone about a week ago. I absolutely love it. I moved up from my S5 & I'm glad I did. The only thing I don't like about it is how fast the battery dies.:2016-06-11:cobie
Samsung Galaxy S7:good phone:I'm generally happy leith this phone. Tho the sensitivity of the screen, I keep hitting l wrong buttons:2016-06-11:demaentia

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great decision:I had my Galaxy S3 for over 4 years it was a heard decision to give it up but I am very happy I did, I love  my Galaxy S7.:2016-06-11:Floyd36
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's a Phone.:I miss a few features that were on my S4 like the smart alarm and, I like the pictures it's camera took better than those coming from the S7:2016-06-11:Jeffinbville
Samsung Galaxy S7:OK:I bought this phone a few weeks ago to replace my S4 mini that was no longer syncing my google accounts.  Its a lot larger and does not fit in my pocket, but does sync my google accounts well.  I also switched cell phone carriers, and am just trying to get used to everything.:2016-06-11:gardenurse
Samsung Galaxy S7:Could be easier to find subtitles:I am having problems with the settings to confusing:2016-06-11:Jackie5775
Samsung Galaxy S7:I am still learning to use it.:This is my first smart phone.  So far I like it.:2016-06-11:JPurefoy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice, but flawed.:"Biggest complaint is the keyboard is messed up. Any key on the bottom row, works how it should only sometimes. So typing this and any other message / text becomes a big pain. There are features from the s5 and 6 galaxy just decided to throw away. Eg: automated email and sms message delay (for those of us who type and send a message before we realize we made a mistake) , IR blaster (used for universal remotes) , swype is no longer standard on the phone, and a few other things. I could get over the other stuff here if the freaking keyboard would work properly. Love that it's suppoosed to be water proof /  more rugged (cased anyway), though I'm hesitant to test it.":2016-06-10:Bluue
Samsung Galaxy S7:A worthy upgrade:Having had this phone only a week, I find it to be a worthy upgrade from my S6. Most things feel similar though quicker and sleeker than before:2016-06-10:ScottK61
Samsung Galaxy S7:All the bang without filling my pocket:I now own a phone that fits in my pocket, and while I miss the s-pen, I will be strong and not cry.:2016-06-10:Largemansmallpockets

Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the camera:Was a gift and I love it!:2016-06-09:Charitystatler
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:Overall a very good phone, I wish the headphone jack was a the top instead of the bottom, and I wish the back came off for a battery pull if necessary. But it's very easy to use and customize:2016-06-09:Nimue1692
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone love that its water proof:I definitely don't regret getting this phone it will save me money in the long I always get my phones wet and buy another one now say good bye to that.:2016-06-09:Ryank27

Samsung Galaxy S7:New Phone:love it in general good battery power and longevity. However. Google does not sync well. Went back to the store and the said verizon is aware of the sync issues and an update will be pushed out. Hope it's soon. I selected this phone much in part due the the google integration and sync capabilities:2016-06-09:HRA6949
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great, but..:I notice for no reason every once in awhile the battery drains more then usual, also If its in my pocket while I'm outside for awhile and then pull it out, its warm and sluggish. Another thing is, sometimes it rings and sometimes it doesn't when people call.:2016-06-09:flyer123
Samsung Galaxy S7:getting used to it.:Takes some getting used to, like any new device. I hope it turns out to be worth the price!:2016-06-09:docbille
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good so far just not sure how to set up my voice mail or if I even need to set up another one?:Still trying to figure out all phone features. Don't know if I need to set up another  voice mail or if my old one still works. It takes some getting used to.:2016-06-08:Mlrp

Samsung Galaxy S7:Good Phone:I'm not an avid smartphone user.  I only really use the phone for the convenience of mobile banking, texting and making phone calls.  The screen resolution is my favorite apart about the phone.  The images are crisp and clear.:2016-06-07:kdob
Samsung Galaxy S7:Still getting used to it. Had an S4:I like the phone, only issue is that the photo chip is not easily accessible with a otter cover and a special tool is necessary to remove it.:2016-06-07:Dennis E
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not bad:It functions well, has a few nicer features than my last lg g3. The camera is good as well as the speedy wall charger.  However,  I don't like not having the option of text messages pop up on the screen like the LG g3 did. And I don't see a setting for it.  It is what it is for a couple years.:2016-06-07:Wise guy
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7:I've had it for few days.excellent except battery life.not like the note3:2016-06-07:Terry1234456
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good experience:I love how easy the transition was from my s5.  The only problem I have is that my s7 drops calls more often.  Other than that,  I love that the battery life is fantastic,  the phone loads pages/apps/etc very quickly, fingerprint scan is greatly improved over s5. Thus was a good choice.:2016-06-07:Lindlandgirl
Samsung Galaxy S7:Need to learn ANDROID OS from iPhone.:Overall, I am reasonably happy with the phone. Drawback is battery life, which is rather short, but so was my iPhone 5C. Google search for ways to reduce battery usage, and taking steps toward that end.  Like the larger screen.  Had to download the user guide to figure out how to accomplish certain tasks.:2016-06-07:Lima Bean
Samsung Galaxy S7:Really like my new phone!:I like the phone, my only dislike is where the speaker is located.  How i hold my phone, i cover it and can't hear incomings.:2016-06-07:Tmb7560
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung - Galaxy S7:I'm very happy with my decision to upgrade to this product.:2016-06-07:BettyMac
Samsung Galaxy S7:nice phone:Nice phone, battery life is not what I expected (i.e. lucky to get 24 hours out of it). Phone appears to be very fragile.  I have had it 1 1/2 weeks and back already has damage from minor hit (it had a protective cover and still was damaged).:2016-06-07:Tom90
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great camera:The camera and the sound are fantastic:2016-06-06:Martha70

Samsung Galaxy S7:nice phone clear pictures:I bought this phone not even a month ago. I like the phone, takes beautiful pictures. the only thing I don't like so far is the auto reply saying I am driving when I am not, and I have to keep shutting if off. besides that phone works great.:2016-06-05:kitt113
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7,really like the way you can get things done with it.:Excellent product...:2016-06-05:Tyronett
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love this phone.:Has heart rate monitor which is neat. I love Samsung period.  One feature I done like is the mic by the text box. I thought it was talk to text but it just records your voice and automatically sends it! Talk about accidents waiting to happen!!:2016-06-05:StoweL
Samsung Galaxy S7:New Phone!:I've only had this phone one week. So far I like it. I had a Galaxy S5 before this so the features are very similar. I like that they added a call filter to the phone so I don't have to use an app. The screen has a very clear picture. I also like the themes you can choose from. So far my only complaint is the battery. It barely lasts a day, if that. Occasionally it also gets hot. But overall a great phone.:2016-06-05:jodibird13
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, great camera, bad battery:The phone is great. Easy to use and streamlined. Lots of cool useful features. Sometimes the battery charge lasts 24 hours sometimes only 8 hours.:2016-06-05:LKirra

Samsung Galaxy S7:GALAXY 7 GREAT PHONE:some issues but Verizon Support corrected them:2016-06-04:Uncle Cee
Samsung Galaxy S7:Slightly disappointed:I was using a Galaxy S3 on Straight Talk and decided it was time for an upgrade. Now I have less signal on Verizon with my Galaxy S7. It works pretty well, and I really like the features. Love the camera! If not for the fact that my signal strength went down, I'd give it 5 stars.:2016-06-04:BruceV27
Samsung Galaxy S7:s7 phone:I am trying to get used to it. It is a little different than my Galaxy 3 note:2016-06-04:Laxel
Samsung Galaxy S7:I hope you appreciate the amount of time it took me to write this review:"This review is getting 4 stars because I was going to give it 3, but my sister, who has my phone's fraternal twin gave it 5. So we're splitting the difference. Please note that the phones we had before were LG Spectrum II's so upgrading to a Galaxy S7 felt like walking out of the smartphone stone age.  Pros according to my sister: Fast Takes amazing photos Screen is a good size Android Double clicking the home button launches camera Screen capture with a gesture! Sweet. Runs apps and games really well. (Very important for Neko Atsume. Because cats are serious business.)  Cons according to my sister: Before getting a case, the rounded screen kept registering touch along edges when the device was picked up or being held. Bought a case and no longer have this issue. Gets warm to hot during use A little too slim Lack of removable battery Cost is high  Pros according to me: 1) Fast (faster than my desktop computer that's how fast what is this witchcraft science?) 2) Nice features 3) Good size screen. Not tiny, not obnoxious 4) Gold color I got mine in is pretty snazzy 5) You can buy cases for them on Society6 and support an artist doing so. 6) Easter egg in marshmallow is delightful. 7) It scans apps you download for threats. 8) Sometimes autocorrect makes me laugh.  Cons according to me: 1) It gets fudging hot with not much use, which makes me nervous because my last phone overheating over and over during use is what eventually killed it. 2) Battery is not removable. First phone I've owned like this. Not cool. What if it fails? What if it stops holding a charge? What if my phone does the same thing my past phones have done and constantly reboot until the battery is removed and replaced? Now I can't carry extra batteries in case of emergencies. Power packs are expensive and not practical for me. 3) Stupidly expensive phone. Only got them because I've paid the cell bill for the last three years, so now I am trading this responsibility with my sister for two years. 4) No physical keyboard (a rare thing for smartphones to have one nowadays. If you don't suffer from Zombie Finger this probably isn't an issue for you, but it is for me.) 5) Phone is slim and slippery. I suggest a strong, grippy case if you drop things often. 6) Due to assinine price this is the first phone I've owned that made me feel insurance was necessary.  7) I typed this review on this phone and thanks to my Zombie Finger my blood pressure spiked at least a dozen times. Nice murder attempt, phone. I'm still alive. Try harder next time. (Please don't) 8) Sometimes autocorrect makes me want to murder. 9) It knows too much.  Been using the phone too long. Time to let it cool down.":2016-06-04:Wind Sama
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy S7:I find the phone works well as a telephone. I do have issues with the battery. I feel I don't get a very long period of time and I'm not sure if this has to do with the fewer number of bars and then I received on my old phone. I have used the camera a limited amount of time and I'm satisfied with the quality of pictures.:2016-06-04:LNCr
Samsung Galaxy S7:The display is very clear.  Easy to transition from previous phone:The data part of the phone is great.  Sometimes people have difficulty hearing me when using the phone:2016-06-04:Nats312
Samsung Galaxy S7:New s7 owner:The screen could be bigger. The phone is super bulky when you put protection cover on it (which is a must for any phone). And as on all phones there's no need for all the extra apps that come with the phone that you can't delete, using space for nothing, please stop this:2016-06-04:S7 new owner
Samsung Galaxy S7:New Samsung 7:Need more time still learning phone,:2016-06-04:lvralphyboy

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great battery life. 32 gig storage, with ability to add more.  Beautiful display, clear pictures. Texting keyboard could be a little larger. Overall v:32 gig onboard storage, with ability to add. Long battery life. Beautiful display. Perfect size screen.  Not crazy about messaging software and texting keyboard could be larger. Clear sound in use and with media. Overall I am very pleased.:2016-06-03:StephstAr
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7:Awesome phone couldn't be happier:2016-06-03:Emtmills89
Samsung Galaxy S7:Glad I upgraded from S5:The features offered in this phone have made it a wise choice for me. The camera alone and its low light feature was a major improvement. Fast response time. Fingerprint scanner is greatly improved.:2016-06-03:Jon in Texas

Samsung Galaxy S7:So far I'm impressed:Battery life (as I use the phone can be up to two full days - at least at this early point.  Had a bit of an issue pairing my Bluetooth headset, but the lady at the Verizon Store set it rite.  Android Marshmallow is very responsive and program interaction is very fast.:2016-06-02:JayMac3

Samsung Galaxy S7:My wife loves it:I purchased it about a month ago and it's still working.:2016-06-02:Dadeleon
Samsung Galaxy S7:Pretty smooth transition:I had a failing phone and decided before heading out on a two week vacation that I needed to have something reliable. It was a big time sink to get things set up and learned before the trip, but glad I did it.:2016-06-02:Ifallsdadams
Samsung Galaxy S7:had some issues with the battery but everything else was great:like the phone a lot, easy to use:2016-06-02:connier
Samsung Galaxy S7:Too complicated:Graphics are excellent. Every thing is very clear and easy to read. My one complaint so far is that I can't always answer a call coming in. Sometimes it says to answer call or ignore. Other times that does not come up.:2016-06-02:rms416
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice Phone:Quick and easy to use.:2016-06-02:Riley89
Samsung Galaxy S7:New User:So far I'm pleased with the S7:2016-06-01:TinKup
Samsung Galaxy S7:has a lot of features:bought it 1 week ago because i based my IPhone:2016-06-01:cookie22
Samsung Galaxy S7:"Great value - 3.5"" audio port acts funny in car":I love my new S7, it works really well, and I love it, the experience in a car with a line in is subpar compared to my Galaxy Note II I had previously.  I may have to get it looked at.:2016-06-01:Veretax
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great so far:I really like this phone so far.  Just wish all my apps would transfer so I don't have to remember them all and reload them.:2016-06-01:happyslappy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy S7:Don't like this phone nearly as much as my old S6 Edge Plus.:2016-06-01:RFMiller

Samsung Galaxy S7:So far no complaints:Bought it 1 week ago, I like it, but wish I knew all the features this has and how to work them:2016-05-31:Toyldynp
Samsung Galaxy S7:"After using a ""dinosaur"", old flip phone...My transfer to a smartphone has been terrific":Not really knowing what to expect from smartphones the transition has been flawless. Still learning all it's intricacies but I really like my Samsung Galaxy S7. Pictures are sharp and clean..Working with apps is lighting fast..Battery life is good, but expect to charge it most every day. Screen is bright and bold as well. Just be prepared for a little trouble seeing it in very bright sunlight.. I really like the feature of adding a SD card to expand storage.. This phone is a winner...Get off the fence and get yourself one...:2016-05-31:SC swamphunter
Samsung Galaxy S7:Takes some getting use to but like it so far.:My biggest problem with the phone is the size and weight.  It is larger and heavier than my Galaxy 4.:2016-05-31:cherlynn
Samsung Galaxy S7:My review:Not much different than the 4 for me:2016-05-31:Reggiea
Samsung Galaxy S7:A pleasant surprise:I had a S3 for what seemed to be a lifetime.  I took good care of it.  The battery on it was finally on its last leg which prompted me to get the S7.  It took me a couple of days to get adjusted to it, but I don't have any regrets.  Puts my S3 to shame which I would hope it would do.  The only downside I see is with the earphones that the phone comes with.  They are not very comfortable and do not stay in my ear.:2016-05-31:juan86
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, battery doesn't last long:I've had the phone for a couple weeks now and I love it! The battery life doesn't last long like advertised but overall I'm pleased with my purchase!:2016-05-31:EHale
Samsung Galaxy S7:Excellent Camera:Easy to use.. Love the camera.. High fan of galaxy products  and Android system..:2016-05-31:
Samsung Galaxy S7:Pictures are stunningly clear.:My old Samsung had to many technical issues that needed fixed. I upgraded to newest phone. The pictures are crystal clear. The phone it's self is way more user friendly now then old phone. A few negativeseconds, the touch buttonscreen keyboard does not always pick up the letters. My family all has apple phones. Their phones Google map works much better then mine.:2016-05-31:Bw425
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love my Galaxy S7  so far:Still have a lot to learn, but I love my new phone so far.:2016-05-31:WhTTTTT
Samsung Galaxy S7:easy transistion:gallery crashed over the memorial day weekend. may have lost all recent pictures and videos. hope samsung techs at bestbuy can recover them:2016-05-31:who cares 6211
Samsung Galaxy S7:It is surprisingly easy to use.:one of the features i like is the way the S7 takes pictures. It focuses immediately and only blinks. it takes great pictures.   another reason I like it is that the charge lasts even when being used.:2016-05-31:Lifesaver77
Samsung Galaxy S7:Takes getting used to!:After years of having an iPhone, I decided to go to Samsung. I had had a Droid X and liked that so I thought an Android phone would be a nice change. My Galaxy 7s has been a challenge. Very sensitive to movement and easily changes apps with hardly any movement. The apps move around on the home screen for no apparent reason. Goggle and Verizon have put so many apps on this phone that it is ridiculous!. I have attempted to delight them and they just keep coming back. Help! I do love the camera and the sound is OK. Finally, battery life is nothing to brag about. Not much better than my iPhone 5S.:2016-05-31:Lindylu648
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery life sucks!:I love most everything about this phone but some days the battery won't even last a full day! If you get this phone, make sure you carry a charger with at all times.:2016-05-31:Willieville_wendy
Samsung Galaxy S7:My first smart phone...:Nice phone but the learning curve is more than I expected.  Had to upgrade in order to use my phone in Canada.  Samsung does not include the manual with the phone.    The user manual is about 160+ pages and you have to print the manual.  How much would that have cost them to produce?  The audio is clear and the volume is fine for senior citizens.  Had a problem with notifications when receiving text messages.  Called Verizon and had to talk to first and second level support to get the sound working on text notifications.  Not sure why Samsung has TWO places in the menu that must be turned ON for the sound notifications to work on the phone.  I am sure in time I will master the device.  The primary reason I chose this phone over an Apple phone was the water-proof feature and the glass on the screen being resistant to breaking.  The phone must be able to withstand a working environment which my old Casio G'Zone did very well.:2016-05-31:Cheese and Crackers
Samsung Galaxy S7:New customer.:New device so far so good.:2016-05-30:GotNunn
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use:Great features except the location of emergency call button on screen:2016-05-30:buzzcook
Samsung Galaxy S7:Still learning all the features...:Happy with product...:2016-05-30:archie7321
Samsung Galaxy S7:Next phone:S7 is a good phone; good size:2016-05-30:golpher01
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's not really missing a star!:This is my first Samsung Android except for a modded Gear.  I usually stayed away from S because of Knox.  But now I consider the world we live in and I'm thankful that I'm not the only one for whom it is extremely difficult to compromise this device.  None of that interferes with performance.  Everything on this phone happens in a snap.  Be sure to check out all the settings and the settings inside settings to not miss out.  Save your thumbprint so you can unlock and get home with one touch.  I have the beautifully designed gold one and it gets noticed (not what I was after but not complaining).   And if you thought it was impossible for S to get out a better looking screen (as if human mind could suddenly stop innovating) think again.  Quad HD in a phone display...   I never rate anything as the best even if it is in my experience.  This is because in everything is room for improvement.:2016-05-29:danielkr
Samsung Galaxy S7:Many more features:So far I am very happy with my G7:2016-05-29:timverizon
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, easy to use:I have had the phone for two days and am living it.:2016-05-29:Boss2016
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nearly flawless.:It's got every thing I want in a smartphone. It's quick, easy to use, and s smooth upgrade from my s5. Only issue is having to press show images on every email I read, which is a lot.:2016-05-29:RMLacey
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love my new cell phone,:Live the mic relocation !:2016-05-29:Strawwalker
Samsung Galaxy S7:It was a very easy transition:I bought this a week ago and I am pleased that it lasts a little longer battery wise than my last Samsung.:2016-05-29:Danabananalol
Samsung Galaxy S7:Pretty Good Phone Overall:Didn't get a real good phone guide...But overall, great phone, easy to use, easy to get used to.:2016-05-28:landoncr12
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice Software, Camera and Processor.:I've had this phone about 3 weeks and have already shattered the glass back.  I bumped it on a chair while in my pocket. My S5 ( no case) was dropped several times with no problems. I don't like cases, but this phone is so fragile a case is needed.  Don't know why they would put a glass back on. Nice phone, should come with case if they are going to make it so fragile.:2016-05-28:orangehat12
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features.:I switched from the iPhone to this. I was looking forward to switching for a while. The only feature I miss from my iPhone is the way the calendar displays. From what I hear, the calendar on the s5 was much more convenient for people whom depend on the calendar.:2016-05-28:Ceci1500
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone overall!!:Great service indeed:2016-05-28:ckredd
Samsung Galaxy S7:Excellent features and an easy upgrade from my Galaxy S.:Bought this phone a month ago and and well up on the learning curve. HD call quality could be better. Telephone operates best when HD is  turned off.:2016-05-28:pmpII
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone, but guzzles battery power:I like the clear screen, nice camera, faster than my S4, BUT it is terrible on battery life even though it has a bigger battery.:2016-05-27:Jack B Nimble
Samsung Galaxy S7:New phone:Never had smart phone .new world of data to me:2016-05-27:Rwr1774
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it:I've this phone for two weeks now and love it. I used to have the s5 and it was a paper weight after the lollipop update so I'm so happy to finally have the marshmallow operating system. I love the look of the phone and all the features. One thing I do miss is the ability to change the text bubbles in text messaging but hopefully they will update that if enough people want it back.:2016-05-27:ahelms05
Samsung Galaxy S7:5135755183:Bought the phone a week ago. So far very happy. Wish the battery life was longer than 12 hours:2016-05-27:Teacher84
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy switch from my previous phone:I bought this phone a couple of weeks ago and I have enjoyed using it.:2016-05-27:ag54
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery issue:Overall, the phone is great. Only problem I have so far is the battery life. I had a Galaxy S4, and brand new could get about 2-3 days use on full battery. I've had the S7 for about 2 weeks, and the battery is my only complaint. Even when not in use (stuck in my purse while I'm at work, the battery is around 70% when I leave work. Just seems to run down faster than the older model.:2016-05-27:taylo185
Samsung Galaxy S7:So far so good.:I have only had this phone about a week and a half and so far I have no complaints. I even got the LifeProof case to go with iteven though it is water resistant. I go through a lot of cold wet canyons so needed a phone that can handle the abuse while canyoneering. If it holds up to the abuse I will be a Samsung fan for life.:2016-05-27:CanyonSlayer
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesome features love the water resistant feature.:I just got my phone on the 18th and for the most part so far so good. Only issue I seem to be having is both my Galaxy S7 and my son's new Galaxy S7 phones seem to get hot at times. I will be sure to call in and make sure this can't become an issue but at this time it's the only minor concern we both have with the phones. The features are wonderful and the camera is superb I don't think I will ever want to go without this level of camera abilities again because taking pictures is my life. The overall phone graphics are great nice and crisp and very clear. Overall pricing good be a lot better this is a completive market and with the awesome service there's room to bring on many more customers by making the service more cost effective for the clients which interns ands more features and lines a customer could afford to have.:2016-05-26:tcosey76
Samsung Galaxy S7:Gary:My reception strength is not as good as my s4:2016-05-26:Gary T
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features.:Great features on the applications to make each one to suit your needs. Camera is excellent. Voice calls are crystal clear. But it will drop calls more than it should. Although i do have data in places my iphone didnt! Battery drains fast so have a charger on hand. The screen in plenty big enough. Over all I am very happy with this phone and would recommend it to anyone.:2016-05-26:Lazybonez303
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy Transition:I made the change from an LG G2 to the S7. It was an easy transition. The phone can probably do about 1,000 things and I do about 10 things. The camera is amazing! Both front and rear-facing is clear.:2016-05-26:CauseImLucky
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use.:Bought it 8 days ago.  Still getting used to the minor differences from my old phone.  Phone is really easy to use and navigate.  Good battery life so far.  Takes great photos as well.:2016-05-26:GeriH
Samsung Galaxy S7:A very solid selection:I upgraded from a Galaxy S4 to the S7.  After having the phone for about two weeks, I continue to be satisfied.  I am very pleased with the quality of images captured using the device's camera, and the ease of storing them on the SD card.  I guess I must be a heavy user, because I require a little charging boost during the day (an overnight charge is not sufficient to last through the day).  I often use my phone one-handed, and the one-handed feature has proven to be very helpful.  The option to launch the camera with a double tap on the home key is also great.  It is these little conveniences that make me really like this phone.:2016-05-25:AngelFish
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use:Got this phone recently. I upgraded from the galaxy 5. Pretty much the same phone with some upgrades.:2016-05-25:Vixx
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features. Great design.:I bought this a week ago, after my Glorious Droid Turbos' screen cracked.  I must say it's a great phone. The battery is a bit smaller in capacity but I get similar usage time so that is a plus. Fingerprint lock is simple and quick to set up; its feauture rich overall. Truly smart phone.  The only thing im not too fond of is the camera, hopefully it grows on me.:2016-05-25:Ange0
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy S7:I am still learning how to use it. The S4 seemed to be easier to go from picture to Facebook, but it has only been two weeks.:2016-05-25:Greene21
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use, better app usage and storage:I have had my phone for 2 weeks. My S4 was dying faster on me after 2 and a half years. I wanted an upgrade and got the S7. I used the cloud to transfer information over from my old phone to my new one, but the S7 does come with a device that makes it super easy to transfer information from one phone to another. I would rate the S7 a five star, however I don't seem to have a privacy folder anymore, and there are some things I don't want others to see but me!  Overall,  it's a great phone and I am enjoying it!!:2016-05-25:Tamia84
Samsung Galaxy S7:Happy I Upgraded:I was uncertain about upgrading to the S7 because I wasn't having any problems to speak of with my S4 but now I'm happy that I did. I have double the storage and a number of the apps that were giving me trouble on the S4 are running perfectly on the S7.:2016-05-25:sbryant065
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use and nice features.:Really like the phone and all of its features. Only downfall is that the battery loses power rather rapidly.:2016-05-24:Deener
Samsung Galaxy S7:nice, but:fewer pages for icons:2016-05-24:mys7
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone:I have had this phone since March and it has been a good phone. Haven't had any problems with it what so ever. Battery will last me all day and that's why I like this phone. I take it off charger round 530am and goes til bout 9pm without having to charge it. Only problem I am having at the moment is my wifi won't turn on at all it ponders it so I'm getting a replace phone. No complaints on my end though.:2016-05-24:jlhoglund
Samsung Galaxy S7:I think it will be a good phone.:Had this phone about two weeks now, and still learning how to do some things.  It's a lot bigger than my old Samsung flip phone, but then, it has a lot more features. One thing I like is the calendar function - works pretty good.  I'm still having trouble finding how to up and down load photos, dates, etc. All in all - I'll keep it.:2016-05-24:bsdunek
Samsung Galaxy S7:Was an easier transition than I was expexting:Only had it a week but so far an liking it:2016-05-23:dennis363r
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use and set up:I waited for a while before updating my phone and this was worth the wait:2016-05-23:chacha86
Samsung Galaxy S7:Fast response and great phone:I enjoy this phone and it is very responsive, quick to the touch and fast. The only down side so far is that the battery dies rather quickly compared to similar smart phones with similar usage. I have used power save mode which helps but it is still not completely on par.:2016-05-23:taram
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition, interesting new features:My Galaxy 4 was DEAD so I needed something new and this fit the bill!:2016-05-23:bgbgbgbg
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy 7 - Still Learning:I bought this a couple of weeks ago when my Samsung 3 began to slow down and freeze up. I am still trying to get certain features set, but suspect that I will discover the secrets to mastering distinctive rings for certain contacts soon. A couple of the apps are a problem to turn off for some reason, which doesn't make sense. Overall it is a better version of my previous phone.:2016-05-23:kasey428
Samsung Galaxy S7:I like my new phone for the most part:I like the new screen and camera.  However, the Bluetooth does not appear to work as well with my vehicle's handsfree phone usage as my previous phone.:2016-05-23:drasticplastic
Samsung Galaxy S7:New Galaxy S7:it is everything I expected.   I like it.:2016-05-22:dgerrie
Samsung Galaxy S7:Simple to use, great camera and long lasting battery:I bought this phone about a week ago and I have been very satisfied with it!:2016-05-22:Raemae6
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very nice phone/plan:Definitely a change from my Windows phone but now I get to use all the apps I want to.:2016-05-22:Snipedawabbit
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone:Solid phone. No complaints:2016-05-22:DeeperThanSkin
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use:My HTC one was dying a horrible, slow death...once my free upgrade  was available, I ran to best buy to get a new phone...it was between this and a IPhone...I've always been partial to android, even though their latest update screwed my phone...I didn't need the edge, just more glass to break, and the has all the same features....it's very user friendly, and I couldn't be happier:2016-05-22:Blueline28
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone:Happy with the phone so far.:2016-05-22:David723
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone:Great phone with a great network.:2016-05-22:Nohawk1981
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone:I bought it a week ago and I do like it very much. Allow it is not as wide as my last phone (Galaxy 3) I am getting used to it.:2016-05-22:Kellylake
Samsung Galaxy S7:New Phone:Glad I upgraded to the S7.:2016-05-22:Ridiculous action
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesome phone:I love the phone. The camera is pretty good, just expected better quality when zooming in. Also, the battery does not last long when I only use the camera and everything else is turned off.:2016-05-22:Ali D
Samsung Galaxy S7:Cool phone with nice features.:"I got this phone to replace my Galaxy Note 2, which was way overdue for an upgrade.  The Galaxy 7 is a great size, and has some cool features.  I do miss having the stylus, and have not found the battery life to be as spectacular as I was led to believe it would be.  I do like the camera, and the clarity of the screen.  The only ""issue"" I have noticed is that I have to restart the phone, fairly frequently, to keep the Facebook app working correctly.":2016-05-22:CNDMeansRN
Samsung Galaxy S7:great performance and ease of use:Great overall phone.:2016-05-22:Joe12379
Samsung Galaxy S7:awesome phone easy to use and nice looking:i bought this phone 2 weeks ago and its been great:2016-05-22:fox115
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it!:Love the S7. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it doesn't have the edit features on the camera that my S5 had. Maybe when it updates. It does everything faster and better than the 5. The camera is a lot better just can't frame or add stickers to your pictures:2016-05-21:Dhav128
Samsung Galaxy S7:Seems like a glorified Version of the S5:I bought this because I had replaced my S5 multiple times dUeda to OS problems. This phone looks and functuous just like the S5 which I love because I already know how it works.  The camera is much better but other than that all the bells and whistles are identical.:2016-05-21:Markey1079
Samsung Galaxy S7:Like the S7:Have had the phone a week now. Had S4 prior so was easy to learn new phone. Disappointed with battery life. Won't go a day without needing charge even with light use. Trying not to buy a mophie like I had for S4. Overall like new phone but not as many new bells and whistles as I was expecting.:2016-05-21:RB111
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great:It's faster and has much better features.:2016-05-20:Lfr2
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice upgrade.:Happy with the product EXCEPT the Facebook app doesn't work consistently.  Sometimes can't search, read continued comments, go to updates.  Also not easy to figure out how to sync with my car.:2016-05-20:frenchprof
Samsung Galaxy S7:I love the camera!  Other features are good too!:I haven't been sorry I purchased it so far!:2016-05-20:ElaineH
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone:Not much different than my galaxy 5:2016-05-20:Hilltopcrafter
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great versatile phone:I do like this phone however what is probably the biggest selling point for the s7 is the vr and I can't find an occulus headset in any verizon store ar p under here.:2016-05-20:Camronricks
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice, but some problems with callers hearing me in my area.:I bought this phone less than two weeks ago.  Immediately started having problems with people hearing me from my home.  My husbands S6, no problems.  Contacted Verizon Customer Service, twice, first time, I took the phone back and was given a new phone to try, same problem.  Contacted Verizon Customer Service the second time and they did something to fix the phone on their end.  Magically, it works.  Verizon Customer Service was Great!  Really helpful and good to work with.  Overall, I'm liking the phone.  Had some issues with it dropping bluetooth, but that seems to be fixed.  I like the phone.:2016-05-20:punruh
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good:So far so good.  The battery got very hot last night and I couldn't use it.  When I got home I plugged it in to charge it and it seem to be fine.:2016-05-20:missbourn1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Definitely an improvement from the S5, but not as good as expected:I got this phone a few days ago. First thing I noticed was the battery life surpassed my S5. I love the fast charging feature. When I was configuring my phone, I had a ton of issues maintaining a wifi connection. I had to force an update to fix the problem and it was a huge pain. Since the update, it has been all good. The screen is very clear and the phone is thinner. Overall, not much improvement from the previous Galaxy phones, but it is a good phone.:2016-05-19:AmyG5
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:Only thing I don't like is its a little small for my preference otherwise great phone:2016-05-19:Ashley29fuller
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung again, of course:After having the previous phone for 5 years or so, getting a new Samsung model made the transition a breeze. Some things work differently and I'll have to adjust slightly, but overall am very pleased.:2016-05-19:Weykat
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love everything about these Galaxy 7s except the PHONE!:"Absolutely love them (2) in all respects but one.  These do everything that our old Droid 4s failed to do. Internet is rock solid and fast, excellent camera, beautiful screen, great sound, voice quality is the best ever.  Love it.  But, the original purpose for buying a ""cell phone"" is to get the PHONE!  Fail here.  Cannot reliably connect phone calls either inbound or outbound.  Mostly when one end of the attempted connection is from our home, but the problem persists when we are out and about not at our home.  Tried a Network Extender at home... no help.  Hours with tech support has produced little success.  I have only 4 days left on the 14 day trial period.  I'm probably going to have to take them back and unwind the deal.  They say they have a technical team working on the issue but I don't expect much from that.  Again, I LOVE everything about these machines except the connectivity problem with the phone section... and that was the point of the purchase anyway.  Wasn't it?":2016-05-19:adennya
Samsung Galaxy S7:easy to use:easy to use, nice large screen. Great camera,:2016-05-19:toolmantom
Samsung Galaxy S7:new phone:traded up to the samsunggalaxy7 good phone still getting used to some of the features:2016-05-19:bos88
Samsung Galaxy S7:Like the phone but- - -:Great phone except for three things - 1) the recent and back buttons are reversed from any other phone I have used, 2) I have to press either the home or power key to unlock it (rather than swiping up) 3) adaptive memory was omitted.:2016-05-18:SteveSh
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy 7:ok...had to replace a Galaxy 4.:2016-05-18:Rita3387
Samsung Galaxy S7:My First Smart Phone:I am enjoying this phone. Having mobile access is nice. The typing keyboard could be bigger, but it is usable. The camera takes really good pictures, especially in low light.:2016-05-18:Traveler53
Samsung Galaxy S7:Quality product:Enjoy my phone. Still learning.:2016-05-18:Dajudge2
Samsung Galaxy S7:New features but easy transition from S3:Overall the phone is a nice upgrade. Still learning about all of the features.:2016-05-18:Ms Nana
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung S7:We had a Samsung S5 so there wasn't a large learning curve.  Great clarity and pictures are better.  The battery life is not as good as the S5 and definitely requires improvement.:2016-05-18:dnajff624
Samsung Galaxy S7:easy to use:so far it has been easy to use and a smooth transition from my previous phone:2016-05-18:reesman22
Samsung Galaxy S7:Enjoying the phone ..:still trying to learn the phone. but enjoying it:2016-05-18:Trish357

Samsung Galaxy S7:Better pics:Worst part is placement of keys. I rest my thumb at bottom of phone which is where the back button and speaker is and it is very touchy, so its aggravating. Seems like they needed to do more trials with different people:2016-05-18:1Shelly

Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice features:I replaced my Galaxy S5 with this newer model. Although the phone has a lot of nice features, they still load apps that I would rather remove but can'take. I'don't also like for the battery to last longer.:2016-05-17:Newsong

Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone. Problems with apps.:The display and phone and camera are fantastic.

Samsung Galaxy S7:Upgrading from Samsung S-4 to a S-7:Two days ago I updated from a S-4 to a new S-7, not realizing features that I enjoyed and liked on Samsung S-4 are no longer available on new S-7. I wouldn't have upgraded to new phone.:2016-05-16:Roberts S4 error

Samsung Galaxy S7:NICE DEVICE WITH SOME LIMITATIONS:The device is sleek and responsive, but......the battery life is significantly problematic. worse than my two year old S5 battery. difficult to believe that after all this technology advancement, battery life would be so short.:2016-05-16:ac1962

Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the features, great phone!:I upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 a week ago. So far I'm really enjoying this phone!! Battery life is great, love the camera!! Definitely will be recommending to family and friends!!:2016-05-15:Redlady72
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the new camera features:Still learning all the features of the camera.:2016-05-14:Gkeeper69
Samsung Galaxy S7:Like it so far.:Only have it for a week. Did not transfer everything.:2016-05-14:Gladys N
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good features:I upgraded my phone about a week ago from a Note3, I miss my old phone, of course I like the updated version on this S7. Battery wise doesn't last as long as my note 3. I like the size of this one, I hardly ever used the s pen from the note. Other then the battery it's pretty much the same. I've always been a fan of android anyway. I love the camera on this phone.:2016-05-14:Cynram
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:Love my phone just wish the battery would last longer:2016-05-14:Cleston
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7:All things transferred over from my S6 seamlessly. Battery life is much better this time around. I do miss the IR blaster. That would've earned 5 stars if that feature was left in.:2016-05-14:Tony S
Samsung Galaxy S7:features:I am disappointed that some things that were on the S4 are not longer there:2016-05-14:jude8
Samsung Galaxy S7:nice phone:Glad I switched from old provider.:2016-05-14:msmith009
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not so easy to transition:Had to load phone numbers twice. Too many steps to delete messages. If I paid top retail dollar, I would have returned it. Phone is good, sound is good, Camera is quick and better than any digital I have previously use. Overall an okay phone for the money.:2016-05-14:rednradd
Samsung Galaxy S7:Better than the s5:Love the camera and features, love the fast charge and battery life. The new spell check is annoying, space bar doesn't always work so ur words get jumbled together. Love the fact I can put a 200 gig card in the phone now. Wish the phone was more of a root phone, it comes with apps I'll never use and they take up space which u can't remove. This phone is like most it has good and bad things just depends on your personal preferences and of course the good outweigh the bad.:2016-05-13:Adammc99
Samsung Galaxy S7:Mostly good. A couple of problems getting to understand it.:Transition from G5 was very easy. Several learning curve problems getting used to program changes. So I like some I dont.:2016-05-13:2121
Samsung Galaxy S7:good features:In the early stages of having this phone!:2016-05-13:Bychoice1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Photo Upload:I bought this Galaxy S7 in lieu of replacing a broken screen. I cannot upload photos to my computer as I could with my Galaxy III. I get a message saying no photos on this device. The phone is fast. I will be a better reviewer in two weeks.:2016-05-13:Brewerbi
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use:Like the use ability:2016-05-13:rbfermoii
Samsung Galaxy S7:So far, it's great except for......:So far my S7 has been great. Picture quality is great, I can read messages without having to increase the text size like I had to on my S4. The only thing I have a problem with is, the phone divided some of my text messages into 2 or 3 different contacts. Very confusing. And some of my contacts are not alphabetized correctly. Not sure if that is a phone problem, or a software issue.:2016-05-13:dpgf
Samsung Galaxy S7:This is a great phone but.....:I really like this phone but two of my favorite things have been taken away. I owned an S5 before which was a great phone. I was sorry to see it die. First of all I used to be able to use the internet while on the phone. Now I can only do so if wifi is available. Also the strength of the bars on the phone are not as good. Everything else is great. I am very happy with my battery life. I am getting 11 hours out of a single charge.:2016-05-11:LCindy702
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's better than my 4s Galaxy:It's better than my 4S Galaxy..a little bit:2016-05-11:Jswjr
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice Upgrade:"Had the phone for about 3 weeks. Overall, very happy with it. Unlike other reviewers, I was upgrading from an S4, so this S7 was a huge step up. The S4 would overheat constantly and was becoming slow as all get out and would not make it through the day on a charge. The S7 so far has made it to the end of the day with several phone calls and texts plus maybe 30 mins - 1 hr total of browsing or streaming video. Better than the last phone but not as good as you think it would be based on the extra weight. Very nice, fast and sharp camera. Great screen and I like the figerprint unlock. A couple flaws: the power button is too low to and interferes with my dashboard phone holder; The screen although it appears to be flat is actually curved back slightly on the two long edges, meaning that the glass ZAGG screen protector the Verizon rep convinced me to buy actually does not touch along the edges making it difficult when you are trying to slide apps around on the home screens - plus it is starting to catch some dirt. Regarding storage: the native memory is sufficient for most users, but I decided to mount an SD card for pics and video. The card appears to not stay connected in there very well, as a few times a week a get a notification that an SD card has been attached, as if it is disconnecting and reconnecting periodically.":2016-05-09:Too busy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features horrible battery life:I love my g7 it fits right in Palm of my hand the features are not so different from the g6 but the waterproof is amazing also camera is not the best but it's good:2016-05-09:Morena706
Samsung Galaxy S7:This is what the S6 should have been:"As headline says, this is the phone we should have had as the S6. However, coming from an aging S4 (which is still a great phone), I am happy with this model. Minor quirks but overall a nice phone. Pros: 1) Very nice camera that doesn't lag as previous one did. Fast shutter speed and low light aperture compensates very nice in dim lit rooms. 2) 32gb onboard this time is great. As many phones come with a standard 16gb, eaten up by the OS and updates doesn't leave much for user space. pair that with a nice size SD card and you shouldn't have to fret over space anymore. 3) Battery is a bump up from the S5 (let's just forget the S6 battery even happened). It could have been a little bigger. I am all for battery life over how ""thin"" my phone can be. Yes it does have fast charging, which helps in a pinch. 4) Fast RAM and processor is great. Smooth transition between apps and also the dual multitask split screen is great. Hope it stays this way if they don't kill it with updates 5) IP68 waterproofing. Granted I'm not one to go test it and it's limitations, it's nice to know If I ever do drop it in water or get caught in rain or even splashed by kids or something, my device is safe.  Cons: 1) Still slim and too slippery. Regardless of non-removable battery, the back is slick, curved glass. Too slippery to hold without a case. It looks great, just asking for trouble if dropped. 2) Battery still small compared to the S7 edge or the S6 Active. Large batteries should be the norm with these ever-growing power hungry devices. Specs keep growing yet batteries stay the same. 3) 4G vs 3G. If you happen to get in an area where 4G may not be available, you may be out of luck. If I go into a store or find myself between towns without 4G, this phone WILL NOT work on 3G. I could have a great signal with 3G and it may as well be in Airplane mode. With 4G, it is fast and works great. I'm not sure if it's the phone or all S7 devices. I have reset network settings, restored phone, etc. On 3G, just a white screen and the loading circle, then ""cannot connect to network"". 4) Speaker on the bottom is nice, yet still not that loud compared to some peoples phones that I hear. I rarely hear it go off in my pocket. Text and calls with volume at 100%":2016-05-08:BeavisJ79
Samsung Galaxy S7:great except wifi worked for 5 days and stopped working:My S7 worked great. But after 5 days 2nd S7 wifi stopped working tried many things as suggested online. Took phone into phone center and said seemed to work? The next day it started to work? Other then that issue works great!:2016-05-08:Baxter97123
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone. Just a few quirks:I love the phone but the screen will turn on all by itself out of no where and any time that you receive a notification the screen will turn on also. there isn't a setting to turn the notification screen wake up off.  Other than that, its a great phone.:2016-05-07:wackattack
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good, but I'm underwhelmed:Overall, I like the phone, but I must say I'm underwhelmed. I moved to the S7 from the Nexus 6p for various reasons and let me tell you, the 6p blows the doors off the S7. I remember being impressed more by the S3 when it came out, which was, next to the 6p, the best phone I ever owned. Maybe it was because the S3 was rather novel at the time. I just haven't seen much advancement and innovation from the S line since the S3. The S7 camera takes great pictures, though.:2016-05-06:Chris0524
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the phone hate the static:Great phone, features awesome. When I use the same AUX setup in my car that I used a Turbo - the static is so bad I cannot call. I found a noise reducer setting for music but phone calls and pauses are impossible. If I can't find a fix I will return:2016-05-05:Docof doom
Samsung Galaxy S7:nice phone:this is a nice phone, I've had it about a week so far and I really like it. the battery life is good, the touch screen is very nice, pictures come out great. I love finding new things that I can do with this phone:2016-05-05:cags51
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features, easy to use.:We bought 2 Samsung S7's. One of them has had problems just suddenly going to a black screen. We could hear the phone ringing & notifications coming in, but unable to respond, with no visual. This has happened 3-4 times in the past 2 1/2 weeks I have had it. We called Verizon support & found out what to do. Apparently, after looking online, we found that some of the S7's do have this problem, it wasn't just ours. The phone itself is amazing. Lots of features that didn't take too long to learn how to use. Camera & audio are fantastic. Battery life is really good. The screen does seem extra sensitive. We put a Zagg glass screen protector on one, but still sensitive. One of my game apps won't pull up sometimes. I have to restart phone. That is the only app I seem to have trouble with with the new phone.:2016-05-04:Kay61
Samsung Galaxy S7:Beautiful design with great productivity!:We upgraded both of our Samsung Galaxy S3 phones and we are very pleased with the new S7 phones. Just a couple of problems, so far. The screens are so sensitive so we spend a lot of time hitting the back button and starting over. And, then there is the issue of all of the preloaded apps. Many of them I would not be inclined to download otherwise, since I have no use for them. And, on top of having all of the unwanted apps, they are constantly updating themselves and I can find no way to keep them from automatically updating or to uninstall (most of) them. Other than that, we love them!:2016-05-03:mabandbab
Samsung Galaxy S7:SAMSUNG S7:Overall I like the phone, camera is great and reasonably easy to set up but a short set up flyer would be really nice. Seems like a good quality phone with great screen and I like that it is water resistant. I did buy a protective case as well. My biggest complaint - as others have posted- is that the antenna on this phone is really subpar. My reception is cut in half and now only part of my house is usable whereas before no problems throughout the house with my old phone, same story at work-- get a few feet from a large outside window and off goes the phone and call. So samsung you need to design a much better antenna for this in your next upgrade-- otherwise, so far, am pleased with the phone.:2016-04-29:woof41
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to transition from way older phone to this one:Bought it little while ago and it fits my needs perfectly:2016-04-28:Jneal
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Features a step up from my basic phone:I bought this phone a couple of weeks ago and am very pleased with how fast it charges up. I like the text message buttons on this phone.:2016-04-28:JRSK
Samsung Galaxy S7:The battery life is horrible:I love my phone, but am not pleased with the battery. It was advertise to have a long battery life and that isn't true.:2016-04-27:Mz Williams
Samsung Galaxy S7:nice phone:I upgraded from an S6. I like the fact that there is an SD card now. So far, I have not had any issues with the battery life. The camera takes amazing photos. I am still learning all the bells and whistles, but I am pleased so far.:2016-04-27:1phatrn
Samsung Galaxy S7:Mostly good:I got the the S7 to replace my S6 that got damaged and lost it's mind. I mostly like this one but the battery life is not great and like the S6 when you finish a call it doesn't want to disconnect. you have to fight it to hang up, annoying. also there are features like briefing that you cannot get rid of and you cannot disable apps you don't want. I do like that it is waterproof.:2016-04-26:petlady
Samsung Galaxy S7:Feels great, works great, except it gets really hot.:I had the Galaxy s5 and was very happy with it. I upgraded to the s7 about a week ago. So far I like how it feels, looks, and works. My only concern is it gets VERY warm when I use Google Maps. I've already done the optimize battery usage process, but it's still running hot. It has me a bit worried.:2016-04-26:DHs7
Samsung Galaxy S7:Problems reading the SD card correctly:Mostly like the Galaxy 7. Going to this one from a Samsung Galaxy Note 3. I like the smaller size and the keyboard is very responsive. Camera takes good pictures. It does eat battery just sitting overnight even when all the apps are closed and notifications cleared. Fortunately the quick charger truly is quick. One problem that I have not solved; the phone is not reading my SD card correctly. I put in a brand new unopened 64 GB card (SanDisk). Portable storage says I have 1.56 GB used of !.89 GB. I realized this after taking a few pictures and the camera said storage was full. I was given a suggestion about how to fix this but it didn't work for me. Any ideas out there would be appreciated:2016-04-25:Readergirl
Samsung Galaxy S7:Upgrade from Galaxy s5:I like the size and slightly narrower profile, easy to use. Amount of memory is good. Holds a charge all day, which my S5 did not. Android M an improvement over L. So far I love it.:2016-04-24:Ella60
Samsung Galaxy S7:A Large Step Up:Just got this phone and am astounded by the differences from my old LG Optimus. Camera is great, memory superb, processor speed amazing. However, battery life is nothing like advertised. I have yet to get more than 2 days out of it and most of that time on standby. Also am unable to receive calls in my home, where I could with the LG on a different network. Not what I expected from Verizon.:2016-04-23:jwn301
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not great service:My new phone will not allow me to access the Internet outside of WiFi. I don't get service where I live. However the phone itself works very well.:2016-04-22:Alygirl7
Samsung Galaxy S7:Still getting to know my phone:I have only had my S7 for a couple weeks but I am already impressed with the screen and how fast it is compared to my S4.:2016-04-22:Csburch68
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone:I bought this phone 1 week ago and love it. I usually don't get new phones unless my old phone is totally not working, but I didn't want to pass up on the deal that was being offered. I previously had the S4 so I can't compared to the later versions ie S5 & S6. There are some features that I wish it had like on the S4 unless I just haven't found it yet. The best feature to me is the camera. The clarity on the screen is awesome. However, I do keep getting an error message that the Samsung Link is malfunctioning. Don't know what to do about that. Customer Support here I come. All in all this is a great phone so far.:2016-04-20:KT12
Samsung Galaxy S7:So far so good, but gets pretty hot at times.:"purchased about a week ago. The design is nice and looks much better than the s5. I am noticing that randomly the phone gets pretty warm. At times its pretty hot. Not sure what is causing this to happen. The phone is a tad smaller than the s5 and is kind of ""slippery"" in your hand. have to be extra careful when holding it. I hope the case remedies this when it arrives. I like the fact that you dont have to swipe the home key for fingerprint recognition, now you just place your finger on the home key.":2016-04-20:KUhombre
Samsung Galaxy S7:Overall very intuitive to use:I got the S7 when switching from another carrier because my Xperia Z3 wasn't compatible with Verizon. I've had Samsung phones before and they were nice but they kept falling apart after a while so I hope they fixed those issues with the S7. The only thing keeping this review from being 5 stars is the battery life. With the Z3 I would be able to go several days on one charge without ever turning on power saver or another feature. I hardly use my phone throughout the day and it still decreases significantly. The messaging is also a little irksome because they don't have one default text messaging app, rather they let you choose between two of them which I thought was rather unnecessary.  Other than that, the phone is very easy to use, reliable, fingerprint detection works well, the cameras are amazing (both front facing and back), it's customizable but not overwhelming. I'm pretty happy with my choice! I would have gone with the S7 edge but there were small features on the phone I didn't care too much about and it seemed to make handling the phone a bit more complicated so I stuck to what I thought was simpler. I'd recommend this phone to others looking for a reliable android that they can get the hang of quickly.:2016-04-20:Godzillainthedesert
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easiest transition! Minimal learning curve from s5:"This phone is great! The only issue I'm having is the curved edge and it's not even the s7 edge! My thumb pad of my palm keeps hitting keys and apps in that corner that mess up whatever it is I'm trying to do, most often type. Also, I have a new keyboard which is also annoying. However, overall as someone who hates change and hates getting a new phone rid this process has been pretty seamless :-)":2016-04-19:Easy peasy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, managing battery life should be way easier.:"The good: - Replacing an older Galaxy S4, it's night and day better just for the ability to have more apps installed and faster processor. - Love the fingerprint unlock for the phone and especially LastPass! - The split screen is also very easy to use compared to the S4. - Always On screen is great to use when you are waiting for a response. - The camera is amazing for lower light photos. - Android Pay is easy to use and faster/safer than a credit card.  What could be better: Out of the box, all the cool toys are turned on, which drains the battery fast. The trick is to learning how to manage usage: - Disabling built-in apps that you don't need - Turning off features that are power hungry - Configuring power saver and ultra powersaver to further manage remaining juice - Accepting that an external battery is essential to have security that your device will make it through a full day away from a charger (Costco gave me one for free)  What drives me nuts: - Why make a phone so slim and slippery that you need to buy a case that makes it more secure and easier to hold? Why not just build it that way in the first place, and increase the battery size while you are at it?":2016-04-18:SteveDz
Samsung Galaxy S7:Yeah, it's beautiful and fast, but...:it's a complete power hog, even with notifications and displays all turned off. 18 hr standby, forget it. Lasts about 8 hours before I have to recharge, and that's normal use, a few phone calls and texts.:2016-04-18:vicarofd
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung S7:All good except the battery life:2016-04-17:Battery life
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love my new 7:The only issue I have is accessing Galaxy when I try talking to it and/or give a command.:2016-04-16:Riiita
Samsung Galaxy S7:Has one flaw:Only complaint I have is the volume buttons and the on/off switch. It's hard to hold phone without pressing the buttons when you don't want to. They need to be in a diffrent position or harder to push.Can be aggravating:2016-04-14:Bird Dog
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not entirely happy with some of the new changes:Battery cycle between charging is terrible. Having trouble downloading pictures to my computer. Still haven't figured out how to receive visual voice mail notifications. The phone won't hook up to my Bluetooth Plantronics earpiece like the S4 this replaced. On the plus side, the camera is far superior, with no delay when pressing the button to take a picture.:2016-04-13:Steve2001
Samsung Galaxy S7:GREAT PHONE, and great storage options.:Waited a week before I wrote this review.:2016-04-11:zelma212mine
Samsung Galaxy S7:So much better than my LG G3!:While my LG took great pictures, the people I spoke to (no matter where in the country they were) had trouble hearing me. Not sure if it was the phone or the carrier, but I decided to change both; and I am not disappointed. The new phone is great. A few glitches here and there (some of the keys on the edge of screen <eg. P, L, Q, A> need to be hit a few times); the battery isn't as great as I had hoped (but the Fast Charge makes up for that). In the beginning, I had an issue with transferring all my things from my LG to my Samsung, mainly my music, but after a quick internet search, it was a breeze.  If not for the battery issue, I would have given this five-stars.:2016-04-11:starg8r
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love this phone so far:I upgraded from an LG2 to this phone a week ago and so far I love it. I have noticed the battery does not last as long as I would have expected and it seems I am continually recharging it. Otherwise I am extremely happy with it. Samsung has always been my favorite of all the phones on the market and will probably stick with them.:2016-04-10:KCP1
Samsung Galaxy S7:easy transition:easy to go from the s5 to the s7, felt very comfortable in the hand. on complaint is the battery life, tends to go faster the my old phone:2016-04-10:scotttttttty
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone - Upgrade from S5:"Bought March 31 2016 - Overall very good phone. Upgraded from S5, which I had to charge twice a day and was very, very slow. So far I've been able to go all day off of one charge (lots of email/general browsing/texting, occasional calling.) Fast. Display is vibrant. No issues with overheating. Low-light camera is a huge improvement. These aren't gallery-quality photos mind you, but still a huge leap forward and more than enough for casual ""look at my dog sleeping in my lap"" facebook photos. The selfie features (wave to set a timer or put your finger on the HR monitor to snap) are genius and make the already awkward process of photographing yourself slightly easier. The fingerprint sensor lock is a nice feature (when you can position your finger right.) Call quality is good. No issues with bluetooth or wifi connectivity.  My only concern is with the phone itself - the body is glass and even with a case on it, I fear for its safety (I am very hard on my phones.) It's also a fingerprint magnet and it's a shame to have to cover up something that looks so sharp.":2016-04-09:Magnetron
Samsung Galaxy S7:Overall, very nice, but it wakes up a lot at random times:Upgraded from S6. Almost double the battery life so far and very smooth operation.  But, the screen wakes up seemingly at random several times a day, which can be quite distracting:2016-04-09:MOS95B
Samsung Galaxy S7:I had a galaxy 3 that I knew how to use...:I am 70 years old and must admit I'm having a tough time adjusting to all the new technology with this new Galaxy 7, but I am determine to learn how to use it. If I continue to have a difficult time learning, I'll get my 12 year old granddaughter to teach me. The design is basically the same, a little thinner, as far as Battery life, I'm not sure yet if it's really better because it's so new.:2016-04-09:Ocean city
Samsung Galaxy S7:loose card:Three times in a month, the sim card has become dislodged. The first time I took in because I didn't know what was wrong. After seeing the process, I've been able to do myself. Very irritating and time consuming.:2016-04-07:Mike 222
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone!:I upgraded from the Samsung Core Prime. The processor on this phone is great! I LOVE the extra Samsung features such as Samsung Milk Music and the Kids app. That is worth cost of the phone alone. The reason why I did not give this a 5 is the battery life. I always use Power Saving mode and I feel as though the battery does not last as long as it should.:2016-04-07:Skip Broome
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use...Not quite meeting the hype.:I love the phone, it's features, and how easy it is to use. Upgrading from a previous Galaxy model the S7 definitely show vast improvements over software, accessibility, and size/weight. I'm, however, a little disappointed that the battery life doesn't live up to the hype or advertisement. It will last me all day, as long as apps are shut down and there's minimal hidden applications running in the background, but I've noticed that some days the battery doesn't last as long as expected, even when I'm not using the phone much. Then again, some days the battery life is amazing.:2016-04-07:dwcfireman
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice:Nice device..........:2016-04-06:Jack1234_
Samsung Galaxy S7:It is easy to use and feels good in my hands.:Got my phone a week ago and was pleased and happy that I picked the S7. Pleased with the camera and speed. Battery life could be better but I am still overall satisfied with the S7.:2016-04-05:Ironman01
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7:I have had my S7 for about a week. The device operates wonderfully. Compared to the S5, the S7 camera is great. I hated the delay on my S5. I don't like the rounded glass as screen protectors don't fit well (not s7 edge). No problems with battery life and I run location and blue tooth all day. Since apps cannot be moved to SD card, I think there should be more memory. I anticipate problems in the future.:2016-04-05:BwdVizsla
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone, poor battery life:Previously had the 5. I had heard the batter life was improved but that is not the case at all. I don't even use it that heavily but the battery barely makes it through the day. The graphics and features are very good and it is pretty intuitive and functions well.:2016-04-05:JimKeav
Samsung Galaxy S7:Better:I loved my S4 but ran out of memory. So far I like the S7, happy that it has more memory, but not happy that 1/2 of that memory is used up by system files.:2016-04-04:LFielding
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone!:I have had this phone for almost a month and I like it a lot. The only thing I wish was better is the battery! This battery doesn't seem to last all day.:2016-04-04:jessica84
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the galaxy:The phone is great the only issue I have is that I lose LTE service and goes to 3g a lot...i came from s5 and i never seen it go to 3g. I had better service on my S5, maybe it will get better. I'm still setting up somethings on it.:2016-04-04:Lizzie1962
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone is Great, Battery could be Better:Had the phone one week now and moved from an S4 to the S7. Love the features and the voice quality and screen. However, the battery is now what was expected and is disappointing.:2016-04-03:Outdoor Girl
Samsung Galaxy S7:Recent update can't copy gif files/Bluetooth connectivity bad:Bought it last month, came with the free VR headset. Pretty cool. Within a month, already needed to have a system update and like all updates, you don't notice any positive outcomes, but you will notice the negative side effects. Can't copy gif files to clipboard anymore. Also, when i listen to misic through bluetooth, it cuts in and out. ONLY AFTER THE UPDATE THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM. I'm not a fan of Samsungs updates. Coming from the S5, where they did an update that KILLED battery life, I'm not looking forward to 2 more years of this garbage.:2016-04-03:Dan t
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the phone but the battery doesn't last!:I bought the phone about a week ago and everything works great except the battery. Before I had the s5 and that battery lasted longer than this one. I do love the screen shot feature and how you can transfer the info from your previous phone with just connecting the cable.:2016-04-03:mec14
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung S7 is a great phone:I've just had the phone a week (upgraded from the Motorola Turbo), and I am enjoying it. It was easy to set-up using Verizon Cloud, and I had it up and running within a very short time span, including inserting the 32GB micro SD card.:2016-04-02:DeborahD
Samsung Galaxy S7:Decent:Good phone, just lost some features/options I liked having on my S4.:2016-04-02:FrankH4th
Samsung Galaxy S7:The features are great and fairly simple to use:I have had this about two weeks nice sleek phone good features battery is not very good and the touch wiz is kind of crazy sometime but all and all its ok:2016-04-02:Ewarden26
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone:I have had this phone for one week and am still on a learning curve. I think it will be great once I get used to it. A little disappointed with the battery.:2016-04-02:O2BINLV
Samsung Galaxy S7:My first Apple-less phone in a decade!:"I was apprehensive about the switch, but the G7 made it very easy for me. So many useful tools--doesn't feel like I'm merely playing with an expensive toy <cough>Apple<cough>. I have had two issues since I bought it, though honestly with how much I find it to be useful it is hard to see the negatives: 1) I got the black screen of death just yesterday! I was freaked out but I did a normal reset on my phone and got back onto it immediately. Also, the battery life is nothing to speak about and I think I must charge it at least twice a day, but I use it for all sorts of things such as a visual schedule and alarm clock (I'm a special ed. teacher in a sensory classroom) and I also use the memo to write my ledger for my budget and things. Very useful! I tried to install themes and also freaked out about an app completely changing the graphics and taking over my home screen. I didn't like that very much as I felt I had no control over my phone, but after some toggling I returned back to my original, simple theme.":2016-04-02:E Marie
Samsung Galaxy S7:My new side kick with cool features and super fast!:What I love about my phone is The clarity of the screen resolution. The Samsung pay capability. The speaker being on the bottom edge of the phone, so I don't have to prop it up to keep from muffling sound. The amplified crystal clear sound. I simply love this phone!  So far the only things I don't love about my phone are It's kind of hard to hold onto because it is very slippery, making it frustrating for taking selfies without a stick. The edge of the screen is slightly raised and I keep accidentally tapping things because I have large hands. The headphone jack is on the bottom next to the charge port.  All in all I am super happy with this phone!:2016-04-01:Skatersmom
Samsung Galaxy S7:Best phone:I recently upgraded from the S4 to this S7 & I'm loving my phone so far. The battery is great, I love the style & durability of the phone. The features are the same & there are a couple new features that I think are great. The always on display, being able to transfer files & messages between your old device & your new one, themes for your phone, & being able to make ring tones from your music. The only thing I miss in my S4 is the IR blaster.:2016-04-01:Sappbaptiste
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice upgrade from prepaid, wireless fast charging issues:I do like the phone, and coming from Android 4.x, definitely a step up. Nice screen, nice camera, overall I am happy. However, the fast wireless charging stopped working. it worked initially, but after what I assume are some updates, the phone no longer fast charges wirelessly (still via wired connection, though). A little disappointing, but I guess one can't have everything....:2016-04-01:sgbani
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesome Phone:The phone is great all the way around. Camera, battery life & new featuresite makes it more awesome. But I'd recommend anymore to add more storage to the phone.:2016-04-01:1Seleeta
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, too much bloat:"The phone itself is the best phone I've ever had but there were far too many applications from samsung/Verizon that either duplicated functions done by other applications or just aren't generally useful. One notable exception is S health which is actually quite good. The phone itself however is incredible.  Pros: Best screen on any smartphone. Period. Best camera I've used on a smartphone. Stellar build and material quality. IP68 dust and water resistant. Microsd slot returned. 6+ hours of screen on time. Oh my God the screen.  Cons: Bloat ware. Speaker quality is meh but my previous phone was an HTC one m8 so I got spoiled. That's literally it.":2016-03-31:E4zy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy Nexus to Galaxy S4 to Galaxy S7:"As a long time user of Samsung Galaxy phones starting with the Nexus and most recently the S4, waiting for the Galaxy S7 to come out was long awaited. The speed and smoothness of the S7 was worth waiting for all around. I'd say the one feature that I loved on my S4 that isn't on the S7 was the ""air view"" feature which I loved. I did experience a problem within a week of getting the phone whereas the carriage that held the sim card and the micro SD card was not making contact at times internally and i'd get a message that it was ejecting and dismounting my micro SD card and then it would fix itself and a message would come up showing micro SD inserted as when you first start the phone. I troubleshooted the device by replacing the sd card and even a factory reboot but the problem remained. I contacted warranty support and they quickly replaced it within a day. As of now I'm hoping this issue doesn't happen again but other than that I think Samsung has produced a phenomenal product.!":2016-03-31:CaryCary
Samsung Galaxy S7:WIFI keeps disconnecting:I bought this phone about a month ago and it continues to disconnect from wifi even though I haven't left the location. Overnight it will disconnect. I hear it's an upgrade issue and I have had several updates happen but it hasn't fixed that issue yet, I'm hopeful though because I do really like the phone..:2016-03-31:connie8101
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice Phone but....:The features on the S7 is more fancy than my S5, of course. However, the phone will not stay connected to the Bluetooth in my car, my WiFi continues to disconnect, and the battery doesn't last long (and that's with everything disabled). I was excited about having something new, but I'm seeing that new is not always better. Samsung please get it together.:2016-03-31:MsArmstrong
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Android Phone:After two weeks with this phone, I am finding it more comfortable to use, as my business phone. Decided to go with this phone, as opposed to iPhone due to the opportunity to expand storage, via SD card. Battery life is ok, while not as good as my personal iPhone 6. I'll need to be sure to have charging available everywhere. The camera is fantastic!!:2016-03-31:Al_T
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung-Galaxy S7:Got the phone last month and like it.:2016-03-30:Cyndi1689
Samsung Galaxy S7:I think I like it:"Had an LG G2 that I loved until Lollipop rendered it useless even after several factory resets, and no Marshmallow upgrade available. Opted to upgrade to the S7 when I was sucked in by a sweet deal at Best Buy. So far, I'm okay with the phone. Call quality seems good, love the size of the phone and the Samsung features like flashlight and S-health tracking. Bluetooth works well as does WiFi. Camera is awesome. Fingerprint recognition is hit and miss, and so is the ""always on"" display which I only use during the night but often isn't on when I look at it first thing in the morning. Battery life is okay at this point. With average use, it still has around 30% left at the end of the day. I deeply hope the battery life doesn't start diminishing since there's no option to change it out. Plus 1 to the LG G3 and subsequent LG phones for their removable batteries. Also, and this is kind of major, I really do not like side volume and power buttons. Always in the way during calls and camera use, although the new protective cover I got does sort of remedy that. But the cover makes it really difficult to depress those buttons. Plus 1 to LG for their back buttons. Plus 1 also to LG for their ""knock on"" feature. I have 7 more days left of my 14 day free return period. Still wondering if I might return this and get the LG G5 instead. One more week to decide. Side note: there was a system update available to download when I bought the phone. The phone came with Marshmallow installed, and I must say I do love Marshmallow. Other phones considered: Droid Turbo 2, Samsung S6, LG G3, LG G5":2016-03-30:Kansas girl
Samsung Galaxy S7:great phone - seems to lose contacts though:Really like the galaxy S7, the battery life is good and with the original charging cable it charges very quick, not so much on the charging pad I have, it takes quite a bit longer with it. I also have some trouble with the messaging, somehow contacts I had already on the phone are gone. Other than that it's a great phone and I am happy with it.:2016-03-30:high desertlover
Samsung Galaxy S7:Upgrade from S5:Great pictures, very clear Have been a bit disappointed in the battery life. Lasts about 5 to 6 hours which was about what my S5 lasted. The fast charge is definitely a bonus and works better than my previous fast charger. About 20 minutes from 46% to 100%. Was having disconnection issues with WiFi but since the last upgrade this seems to have improved. I moved my 64 G card over from my old phone so all pics and files came with. Nice having the 32G in the phone. My old phone only had 16 G an I was forever getting notices to delete info. Overall, I like this phone and find it very easy to use.:2016-03-30:Fredtdog13
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, battery is disappionting:Ive had the s7 about 2 weeks now and will say its a great improvement over my s5, especially the camera. No comparison at all to the s5. I can also tell a difference in the display on my games. It has better, sharper colors. My only gripe would be the so called bigger/better battery. It last about as long as the s5 did in power saving mode. Under moderate use I have to charge it ain the afternoons. But still better than an iphone.:2016-03-30:scott8875
Samsung Galaxy S7:snap to transfer. great features:Very pleased overall,but battery life still sucks!:2016-03-30:rithawil
Samsung Galaxy S7:So far, so good:I loved my S5, but I accidentally melted it so was forced into upgrading. Figured if I was going to get a new one, may as well go with newest technology. I'm still learning about some of the features, and there are some I'll never use. It has a nice feel to it, & I hated to add a case to it, adds weight, but I also don't want to ruin another phone. The doubled up locking feature is very annoying, since I use the phone as am alarm, but there may be a way around that that I haven't figured out yet. It's fast, the display is clear, the speaker is tinny but louder. I still haven't figured out how to access & play my music, and don't understand why my voicemail files show up in my music file (anybody have an answer to that?), but my biggest gripe is the battery life. All the pro reviews raved about a super long battery life & so-called fast charge, but this thing eats battery like crazy, even with a lot of hoggy apps turned off, and it doesn't charge any faster than my S5. Another couple weeks of use & I should have a better opinion. I like this phone, but I don't love it ....yet.:2016-03-30:Kimbpaul
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7:I have had my phone a month and I love it, mainly because it stays charged unlike my previous one. I love the externalook storage and that it is water resistant. One issue I have is a few apps are not compatible or do not work as well with this phone. It is new so maybe it will get better.:2016-03-30:Whttr
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy S7:I have had the S7 for nearly 3 weeks now. I love the model and the phone itself, however, I have noticed that the two apps I use the most function horribly on this phone. These apps are snapchat and S health. I use S health for monitoring my exercise and eating and the update for the app really affects how I feel about the device. For some reason I am unable to see most people's snapchats also and I am unsure of why this is. Beautiful device but not functioning as well as my S6.:2016-03-30:Cassie2720
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good Upgrade From S4.:"I am enjoying the S7 thus far, EXCEPT, every time I turn on my bluetooth, the ""Driving-Mode"" comes on, but I might be sitting at my desk or sitting in a chair. That seems to be my only problem at this time.":2016-03-30:KMonk73
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very nice phone but one problem so far:Seems like a great improvement over S4 - longer battery, good speakers for a phone. One problem - we can't get it to properly connect to a laptop through a usb connection. Technical support could not fix it.:2016-03-30:olsson
Samsung Galaxy S7:S5 to S7:"Pros: Great storage capacity, call quality is amazing, low light pictures improved, daughter loves new kids mode, new multi window features are useful, screen size is larger by a small bit. Cons: battery life hasn't improved, runs hotter than s5 when using GPS location features, charge speed is slow especially compared to s5 speed charger, curved glass on regular s7 phone screen has left screen edges vulnerable (about 1/8 inch on all sides) since tempered/ballistic glass covers do not curve, and haven't yet accommodated for it so I had to get a wallet phone cover in addition to the ballistic glass cover for extra protection of the screen.":2016-03-30:Kittenkibbles
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone:I really like the phone, except for the bug that I am trusting will be patched soon. It is really a pain to turn the Bluetooth off all the time in order for wifi to work correctly, and then remember to turn it back on in order for it to work with the car. Never had a problem like that with my S3.:2016-03-30:Steve1578
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice screen:"Love the clearer screen. Upset the screen scratched in less than a week! :( So much for gorilla glass. Don't like that it tends to skip when you are scrolling. Otherwise happy with the phone- BEATS APPLE.":2016-03-30:Ksparac
Samsung Galaxy S7:Fast!:I have had the S7 for 3 weeks now. It is much faster than my old HTC One M8. I like it's slightly smaller size. The camera is awesome!!!  There are way too many pros to list.  I hope in upcoming updates Samsung adds arrow keys to the keyboard and also works more towards improving ease of moving around between texting to calls to contacts to recent calls.:2016-03-30:JohnEFGHIJ
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung 7:Nice phone except it keeps losing its charge very fast:2016-03-29:Lucky Puppy
Samsung Galaxy S7:I'm in love all over again:I just got it March 17th, so I'm still learning all the new differences from my Galaxy S5. I like the background options, camera, and the multi window option so far. I especially love the color gold instead of the black or white phone.:2016-03-29:MekaF
Samsung Galaxy S7:dissapointing:"camera is grainy in low light. not ""awesome as everyone describes. same as or lower camera quality as S6. lagging qwerty keyboard too. having to hit things twice sometimes. battery drains quickly while being used. lasts very long in standby. charges very fast. processor is same speed as s6. good phone, but no better than an S6. especially not for the extra money. it seems as though they refuse to blow you away with top features. why would they downgrade from 16mp to 12. they just slightly upgrade one or two things to string you along until the next great release.":2016-03-29:jschmidt
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung s7:The phone it Great....only problem I have is I drop calls 1 out of 10:2016-03-29:Yocouch1386
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use. Great battery life.:I've had the phone for a couple weeks now haven't had any issues with battery life. Love the camera. I have plenty of storage space. Only issue I've encountered is that my keyboard will switch away from Swype on occasion and I have to reset the keyboard settings entirely to change it back.:2016-03-29:Drbrowne
Samsung Galaxy S7:Perfect!:I upgraded from an iPhone 6 and was uneasy because I am very attached to the iPhone features. However, it took about two days of setting it up the way I like and I found that it has all the features of the iPhone that I like and of course...more. I honestly did not think I would like it. I do. And I'm glad I took the chance....and that was without reading reviews so rather risky...yikes!:2016-03-29:Stephanie Barclay
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung 7:I love the phone, I had the 5 and upgraded to the 7. It is just great.:2016-03-29:djk58
Samsung Galaxy S7:Camera better and HAPPY about SD card but lost some features from S5:I generally like this phone and the camera certainly is better but I am having 3 issues. First, on the keyboard the emoticon key defaults instead of the microphone and since I use the microphone often, this is very annoying. Second, the period has replaced the comma on the main screen. I know I can hold down the period key but again annoying. Third, there is no touch sensitivity and this is affecting my game play which is very, very annoying. I came back to Samsung due to the SD card. I have A LOT of music so the card is necessary for me.:2016-03-29:jafbey
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good Product, mostly:We picked up our phones on the 12th and things were going well until my phones screen went black. I tried to find a solution on the Verizon website but the website is next to useless. I finally resorted to driving up to our nearest Verizon store and the young lady got the phone working again. She had to simulate removing the battery because you can't physically remove the battery on these phones. I installed an update today and I'm hoping that may cure the screen issue?:2016-03-29:KJO16
Samsung Galaxy S7:Best Galaxy yet!!:The ease of use (as an android user) is appreciated, however, if someone is not used to the OS then it might be a little more taxing on the set up process. The OS is very smooth and easy to maneuver through. The camera is a significant upgrade as well. If Samsung would not put so much stuff stored on the phone that took up memory it also be a significant improvement.:2016-03-29:acsmith8213
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung continues in the tradition of producing great phones:I really like the S7. I had an S5 before and liked all of the features it offered. The S7 pretty much continues with everything that my S5 had and so much more.:2016-03-29:JJOHNSON0612
Samsung Galaxy S7:good upgrade:coming from a galaxy 4 mini the screen size is an improvement. The battery life good improve. I have had the phone less than a month and the batter needs charge about every 12 hours. The drawback to the phone is the no replaceable battery. Picture quality is great as is the volume.:2016-03-29:childd
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesome phone EXCEPT FOR BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY:"I bought the GS7 a week or 2 ago and it is a truly awesome phone. Everything is faster, simple to use and did I say FAST? Great camera improvements including rapid shooting, resolution, video, etc. External storage port is heaven to have again.  Now the BUMMER: This phone does not see any of my bluetooth headsets, at all. I am an avid podcast user while running and hiking. My Old Galaxy S4 saw each of my 3 bluetooth headsets, each from different manufacturers and all relatively new but the GS7 doesn't. I have scoured the web for a solution, tried everything even remotely related to posted GS7 BT problems but no luck. I am so bummed and can only hope it gets fixed in an update. It's like having half my phone! Otherwise, fantastic phone. If they fix the obvious bluetooth problem I would rate this phone 5 stars easily.":2016-03-29:MachineUser
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery life leaves a lot to be desired:This is the first Samsung phone I have owned, after buying Motorola's for the last 8 years. I have had this phone for almost a month and while I like a lot of the Samsung functions; after normal use during the day (checking social media several times and taking a few pictures, and several phone conversations), my battery is typically at 40% by 5pm. I'm not sure if this is standard for this manufacturer or not. I verified that it is mostly the OS that is using up the battery, not apps. I do really like the removable storage, so I can have all my music on that, rather than the phone.:2016-03-29:Ang88
Samsung Galaxy S7:great features but wifi bugs:Phone has a great camera and much better battery life. The one big issue has been the wifi drop that reverts to mobile data even while at home with a strong wifi signal. Recent patch update but will have to see if that does it.:2016-03-29:docJerry
Samsung Galaxy S7:Like the upgrade:Swapped my Iphone 6s for the S7. For the most part I have been happy. I did not like that they took away the find my phone option. Like the return of the memory expansion. Big plus that it allows me to voice text through my jeep.:2016-03-29:czure11
Samsung Galaxy S7:Impressive phone:"I finally decided to upgrade from having a Galaxy S3, to the new S7. This phone has awesome features including: pretty good battery life (assuming you install a 3rd party app killer & manage your apps accordingly,) an EXCELLENT camera, & beautiful display, good call quality, more functional voice controls, an ultra power saving mode which comes in handy when battery life is getting low, external storage (up to a 200 gig micro SD card) & water resistance.  On the down side I've noticed that the screen sometimes doesn't initially respond when you attempt to select something & as a result you have to tap it twice (I noticed this prior to adding a tempered glass screen protector.) The finger print reader usually registers, but will fail almost all the time if your finger is even the slightest bit wet. I've also noticed that certain email apps fail to deliver push notifications (mainly the Yahoo mail app & after trying quite a few things including clearing the phone's cache & clearing the cache on the app, the only way I've gotten it to work again before it decides to fail again, is to completely uninstall it & then install it again.)  Over all I've very pleased with this latest Samsung phone & I'm very glad to have purchased it.":2016-03-29:gchildjr
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great so far, with one serious concern:After two weeks of using this great phone, the screen went black. The phone was still on but the screen stayed off. I checked the Verizon website and found a soft reboot procedure which started the phone again with the screen working as usual. Other than that negative incident, I would say that this is the best Samsung Galaxy that I have owned. The features are intuitive, the screen is clear and has GREAT definition, the camera has worked flawlessly, and the touch screen is amazing. When other people ask to see my phone, the most often compliments are how great the screen definition is, how light the phone is, and how the screen responds to touch.:2016-03-29:ChrisL66
Samsung Galaxy S7:So far So good:it moves pretty fast and I like the metal case and wireless charging option. The notifications on the OS leave something to be desired the persistance of trying to ad my data to a cloud when I keep saying no is annoying:2016-03-29:DJ Jonny Blaze
Samsung Galaxy S7:Pros and Cons:"I got my S7 the day it came out, trading in my S3 which I loved. There are definitely pros and cons Pros: Fast, great camera that has no delay, graphics are top notch, cool options, love the fast charge battery Cons: Defaults to black screen without warning and has to be restarted, Gallery freezes and has to be restarted, Auto restarts sometimes without warning.  Not sure if I have a defective model or if this is just to be expected?":2016-03-29:SSageRN
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone!:I've had this phone for a week now, and overall, it's been fantastic. Quick, smooth, great features, has all of the Samsung ecosystem apps, and it's a great size. My only real problem is battery life, I tend to use it up in about a long day. However, with the adaptive fast charging, this is MUCH less of a problem than it would be otherwise.:2016-03-29:acalltoashes
Samsung Galaxy S7:Much improved since the S4!:I went from a Galaxy S4 to an S7 with Verizon's new upgrade program. I really like how I upgraded my phone, went into the new plan, and reduced my phone bill without paying a huge upfront cost for the phone. Very nice for consumers and makes me want to stay with Verizon.  I love the S7. Super smooth. The camera is by far most noticeably improved from the S4. Clean images and ability to edit.  Operating system allows for quick app. startup and processing. Buttons have quicker response time.  The ONLY reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because of the removable battery. The S7 is solid state, unmovable battery. This is a problem when/if the phone freezes. Also, in the event someone would want to carry a backup battery for long trips.:2016-03-29:TomMcGinniss
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great, but glitches:I love a lot of features of the phone, so far pretty happy. I wish the keyboard was more sensitive and reponsive, it frequently kicks me off wifi and often have to restart the phone. Also, this is more of an app issue, but certain apps don't work well and then some work perfect one day and not the next. I love the camera, wireless charging overall phone, just hoping some of the phone and app issues get worked out soon.:2016-03-29:Missmcd80
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesome phone!:I love this phone however since the new update my wifi doesn't work and I end up having to use my data instead of my home wifi. Please fix it's my only complaint.:2016-03-29:Timothy12
Samsung Galaxy S7:Works as good as my S4 before Lollypop:I like the phone. However I wouldn't have upgraded from my S4 if Verizon hadn't forced Lollypop on me. It degraded my S4 to a feature phone. I don't see much improvement over the S4 except more memory and possibly longer battery life. Anything else is incremental at best.:2016-03-29:MrFledge
Samsung Galaxy S7:VIDEO & SOUND QUALITY ARE GREAT!:I like it, it is very fast, video and sound quality are excellent. Not a 5 due to battery life but at the same time no less than 4 because battery recharges super fast.:2016-03-29:idahosunshine
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phablet to Smartphone:I picked this phone up a couple of days ago. So far I am enjoying it and its features. The double tap on the home button to open up the Camera is a nice touch to catch those precious moments of your children that come and go so quickly. The screen is bright and clear. The touch screen feels very accurate and even though this phone is smaller than the Note3 I came from it is easier to text on. There are however a few things I may change with this phone or phones to come out in the future. The S7's design is elegant and smooth, but, with this smoothness comes a con. If your hands have any sort of moisture or natural skin oil on them this thing feels like it will slip right out of your hand. I highly recommend a case (who doesn't buy one?). The other con I have is the battery life. This is probably due to the fact I came from the Note3 and it has a much larger battery capacity. I was literally watching the battery go down with light usage, the power saver feature on and the screen brightness as low as I could have it and still make out what is was on it (I closed all backround apps). I hope in the future phones get thicker to help support larger batteries and to fit better in your hand.:2016-03-28:IGJoe2192
Samsung Galaxy S7:Everything but battery:I love how crisp and vivid the screen is. I love that i can put in a micro sd card and expand my storage. I love how lighting fast the phone is all around the phone is amazing. The only eye sore for me is the battery. I will pull phone off charger and the battery literary melts away. I use my phone lightly at most i run spotfy while at work which i understand can kill a battery. When im at home and i want to check Facebook for two mins the battery drops very fast it makes my head spin how fast it drains even in power save mode.:2016-03-28:JakeOclair85
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone with minor disadvantages:"I upgraded to this phone from a S4. This was a major upgrade even though I lost the removable battery and IR blaster, I kept microSD card support and gained water resistance. One thing that I don't like is the level of difficulty involved in repair of items that could fail on the phone (ie. battery, screen, charging port, etc). I personally repaired the screen on my S4 at least 4 times including the digitizer as well one time. This is much more difficult on the S7. The battery life on this phone hasn't impressed me yet either. The phone has always made it through the day for me, but sometimes it will barely make it to 9:30 or 10 PM. From the battery stats screen, android system and android OS are the culprits with the most battery usage, which tells me that perhaps a software upgrade could improve battery life. The screen colors look great, the camera comes up quick and focuses even quicker, Samsung pay works well, I love being able to take the phone in the shower and listen to music, the always on display works well and is handy, performance and multitasking works very well, and call quality is top notch (especially HD voice). All in all, I'm happy with this phone, I know that no phone is perfect, and I think this is the best phone on the market currently which is why I chose to upgrade from my trusty S4!":2016-03-25:projectrang
Samsung Galaxy S7:Rough Start:I absolutely love the phone, it is amazing. I think it's a great device. It's very fast, and the features are way better than the iPhone or Galaxy S6. The only problem I am having with it is the battery drains pretty quick (at least on my end), and I use my phone moderately. I do not play games on my phone, but the one game I have runs fine on it. The other problem I am having with it is that the internet will constantly disconnect and reconnect - regardless of if I am connected to WIFI or cellular. I think it's a glitch in the software Samsung may be fixing. Other than that, it's a great phone.:2016-03-21:mjr0729
Samsung Galaxy S7:Beautiful, fast, fun but battery life nowhere near what was reported:"I have had my phone for 4 days now and love it in all aspects but one - the battery life, which was one of the main reasons I selected this phone so I am extremely disappointed. At first I thought it needed a full drain and then a charge but I've done that and still see poor results: 6 hours of being unplugged (at 100%) and used mildly while at work resulted in 46% battery life. That is exactly what I was seeing with my two year old Droid ultra that was known for notoriously poor battery life.  Otherwise it is a beautiful, responsive, impressive phone. Have not taken any photos yet but viewed the camera and the image on screen looked nice. I read the complaints about bloat ware before I purchased but was pleasantly surprised to find it wasn't anywhere near as bad as I was expecting - only a handful of programs that I didn't have on my old phone and that I needed to uninstall.   If it weren't for the battery life this would be a perfect phone. As it is, was torn between recommending and not.":2016-03-18:Sloane686
Samsung Galaxy S7:From S5 to S7:I've had this phone for a little over a week now and it works flawlessly. Great phone with a lot of features. very fast processor and a beautiful display. My only problem with it is the battery, it dies pretty fast. I would have given it all fives if it wasn't for that. Hook it up to the fast charger and it's back to full power in a hurry. overall a great phone.:2016-03-17:phnefrme
Samsung Galaxy S7:Fast Hardware, Solid Phone:"I like this phone so far. The selection of ringtones the s7 comes with is horrible. I guess someone is trying to get you to go out and buy better ones. More choices for simple ringtones and notifications would be good for a 'top-of-the-line"" device. I saw someone complain in a review that the fingerprint unlock is slow, not so on this device; it is very quick to unlock and way faster than typing in a pin or password.":2016-03-17:NitrousMoxide
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy Setup:"I am very happy about the ease of setup and transferring data from my old phone. This phone is fast, ""right"" sized"", and convenient. The best feature for me is the expandable memory.":2016-03-16:alouisious
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, wish the battery was just a bit better:"Overall I do recommend the S7. The screen is great (minus the lag time with manufacturers of screen protectors getting their act together to cover the curved edges of the screen, but that's not the phone's fault), hardware is great and it operates very smoothly. Camera is also very good from the few tests I've done in the past week, and I love the microSD card slot. My only gripe is the battery. Maybe I had my expectations set too high before I got the phone but it doesn't seem to be holding a charge like a brand-new battery with this capacity should.   My older phone was a little over 2 years old and had a 2300mAh battery (HTC One M7). On a daily basis I use my phone at work minimally - check email a few times, browse the internet at lunch, etc. and maybe a few texts, but that's it. No gaming, no extensive browsing or app usage. I even hibernate apps I'm not using to save battery. My old phone would hit about 50% battery at lunch time and around 2:00pm I'd have to charge it so it wouldn't die before the end of the day. I expected that from an old phone with a smaller (by today's standards) battery.   The new S7 has a 3000mAh battery, should hold a charge like a new battery, and is using a newer version of Android which is supposed to be ""more efficient"". With the same usage, I'm finding that the battery is around 60% after using it at lunch time. Somehow I was expecting to go home after work with 60%+ battery left....maybe that expectation isn't realistic? It just seems like it wouldn't hold up at all to a full day of photos, web usage, navigation, etc. if I was out on vacation or something.   Again, overall this is a great phone, and it's not like the battery is worse than what I had previously. I just expected a bit more from a new phone with higher capacity than my old phone.":2016-03-15:JthePlantman
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone but Bluetooth troubles:I have to say I love almost everything about this phone. I had an S5 and I waited for this because I wanted another waterproof phone. It was easy to set up and transfer my info (except that a few contacts didn't transfer for some reason.) My only real issue is that the Bluetooth cuts out and is distorted. I stream Amazon Prime Music from my S5 to a wireless speaker in my office everyday. With the S7 the connection shuts off after 1 or 2 songs. Sometimes it speeds up, slows down or buffers as well. Fortunately I kept my S5 so I can just use that to stream music over wifi and use my S7 for everything else.:2016-03-14:MAP2
Samsung Galaxy S7:Like the phone - HATE the glass cover:I really like this phone but HATE the fact that the tempered glass cover doesn't cover all of the screen. What's the point of a screen protector if it doesn't cover the whole screen?!:2016-03-13:jnh45
Samsung Galaxy S7:great phone:everything seems good so far just got it today. Only negative things with out a case the phone is too slick some texture on the back or sides to give a little friction would be better to make it less likely to slip from your grip. Everything else I love and seems to work great.:2016-03-11:mostree
Samsung Galaxy S7:Ok phone, but the singal is 5 times worst than the S4 mini I traded for the S7:Like the phone and features, but the signal is bad. Inside my garage, I have one bar on meter. Step outside, I go to 3 bars, never have had a full signal meter.:2017-04-17:Maint
Samsung Galaxy S7:Should have waited for the S8:Not much of an upgrade from S6 to the S7...unfortunately I needed to upgrade and could not wait for the S8:2017-04-14:Kimmiesj
Samsung Galaxy S7:screen sensitivity?:"I've had S7 Galaxy one week.  It's a huge leap from my previous phone.  My primary complaint is that the screen touch is too sensitive and/or it does not take me to where I want to go, (e.g. ""contacts"") , it goes some where else.so I have to return and try again.  The technology assumes I know certain things or   that I like to play as if it's a toy.  I didn't buy an expensive toy, I wanted a useful tool.":2017-04-11:pack10man
Samsung Galaxy S7:Husband switched from iPhone.:The phone was for my husband and he seems to like it.  It's just hard for him to relearn since he had his last phone for 5 years, haha.:2017-04-10:Loveydoveykel
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7:Right after we ordered phone I mean the next day S8 was advertised should of had option of going to s8:2017-04-07:Woodyjoe
Samsung Galaxy S7:My Service Isn't Good:The phone itself is good, but my service sucks at my house. I put a ticket in about two weeks ago regarding my 1X service capability, but nothing has changed. I also just learned about the Samsung Galaxy 8 after I just upgraded and got the 7, which is kind of disappointing since no one told me the 8 was out.:2017-04-06:LeLe Webb
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7:Traded Droid Turbo 2 because after every download it would begin to shut off and battery would get very hot. After second reset of phone I decided to trade in and get the S7. Going to return after first week due to weak battery and overall not satisfied with smaller phone size and constantly having to change screen due to accidentally touching the screen and causing actions I did not want. Going to get a larger phone like the Edge or the Plus for better battery and handling.:2017-04-04:Ripper85
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not thrilled:If I use this phone the way I want to, the battery goes from 100% to 20% by the end of the afternoon. It means keeping the charger or Mophie close by. This has been my experience w/ several Samsung Galaxy phones.   I use a lot of apps & I bought it for the split screen & floating app capability. These features work, but they are cumbersome to get to. And the screen size makes them cramped. Using the split screen feature causes some of the apps to hang & require a phone restart.   Display is sharp & clear. Camera is good & easy to access. Phone calls are good quality, regular, speakerphone, or Bluetooth.   My recommendation comes w/ qualifications.:2017-04-03:AZGadgetGeek
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love it! But...:"I love the S7, but within the first 4 days of having it, the phone froze on a white screen with ""verizon"" and 4 dots going across the screen. It was very irritating but after that caused my phone to die, I charged it and it went back to normal. Not sure why it happened, it was fully charged before it happened. I'd recommend the S7, but make sure to have a back up in case.":2017-04-03:Adevl23
Samsung Galaxy S7:Still Getting Adjusted to it:There are good points and not so good points as far as the overall design, sensitivity, etc. qq Gets very hot frequently. Still a bit early for me to a full rating.:2017-04-02:MurphAwosting
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy s7:Phone works great and have some good features. The pictures are clear and can save more pictures on phone. Just wish screen could be bigger like the galaxy 8:2017-04-02:Ashkii
Samsung Galaxy S7:I do not like this phone or the company:I do not get very good service at my house or when traveling a lot of the features are too hard to use battery life is too short takes too long to charge the camera work good it's easy to send picture messages:2017-04-02:Neltson
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's not what I expected.:The keyboard options are limited. It's different from what I am used to and I am hoping that it proves to be reliable and a good decision but it is too soon to know.:2017-04-02:Rebeccae71
Samsung Galaxy S7:It has its issues:print is small by default. Once font was adjusted it messed messenger up. Not impressed with the sound. Especially playing music or even streaming or facebook voice. Turned up all the way and you still have to almost put it to your ear. Phone audio is ok though.:2017-04-02:kamccdo
Samsung Galaxy S7:Issues already...:Nice product, except for the fact that out the box there have already been issues with the screen. Good thing I'm within my exchange period.:2017-04-01:Tdc214
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice easy to set up.:Was easy to set up had no junk apps installed. Screen is a little small. My old phone was much bigger.:2017-03-31:fzum
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone but fragile:Love the Galaxy S7. Features are awesome. Load times are great. Screen is the perfect size. I do wish the back wasn't glass. I didn't realize it was a glass back when I ordered it and didn't find out until I cracked it the first time I dropped the phone from about 2 feet within 2 hours of having the phone (it fell out of my pocket onto the ground from the seat of my car). I had ordered a protective case but it hadn't shown up in the mail yet but I need the phone for work so I carried it.:2017-03-30:bankai8993
Samsung Galaxy S7:Liked My Samsung Galaxy 5 Better:I have lost a lot of functionality I once had, system appears to operate slower.  Maybe it's just a learning curve, but I feel like I have lost a lot of what I once had.  Battery life not impressive; although I love the wireless/portable charger.  Camera is good and the phone looks very nice.:2017-03-30:Hkamann
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointed:I had the Galaxy S3 over 2 years ago, it was a great phone. I like to change things up, so I went with a motorola. My brother and his girlfriend both have the S7 and when asking for input on which phone I should get  next, they said s7. I've been incredibly disappointed with it since I received it about a week ago. The battery drains way too fast; for example, I'll wake up with it fully charged, I'll visit some social media sites, and within the hour it drains to 70%. Okay, whatever, a lot of apps are running. I keep my phone in my locker at work and by the time I get to it at the end of the day it's down in the 20's. Not only does the battery not last, but the performance has been slow. It lags during videos I'm watching (it even happened recording one recently) and in general will just freeze on the apps I'm using. I can't help but get frustrated anytime I pick up my phone and wish I had ordered something different.:2017-03-29:kimlxx
Samsung Galaxy S7:Its ok:The phone itself isn't bad, but having converted from a Windows Phone, the Android interface is too much like iPhone and most apps are requesting access to things it doesn't need access to.  If Samsung produced a Windows phone again, I would switch back in a heartbeat.:2017-03-28:JeffS1228
Samsung Galaxy S7:transition from Windows to Android:I really hate Android. My wife and I do not use a phone as an entertainment device. So all the STUFF is overly complicated. Everything that used to take on tap now takes three because you have so many options for every command.  The size is fine and the graphic resolution is nice but I really miss just being able to make a phone call. Or send an email.   I also hate having to charge this thing every day too. The battery life socks. It said it could work for three days on a single charge I can't get a full day out of it.:2017-03-28:old school
Samsung Galaxy S7:Wish I had my Galaxy S5 Back:Samsung changed things that I feel didn't need changing and just made it more complicated to figure out.:2017-03-27:MOK38
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery is horrible..:We moved from Samsung Galaxy 6's to 7's because our batteries were dead, even though our 2 year contract was NOT up.  We couldn't even wait until the Galaxy 8 was out and we could get 7's cheaper.  The new 7 battery is as bad as our 20 month year old Galaxy 6!  Ridiculous!:2017-03-27:Brenda1212
Samsung Galaxy S7:good phone but eats battery fast and uses data like crazy:Like the phone however the battery life is very short, it charges super fast but can't get more than a day on a battery and it's only 2 months old. For whatever reason this phone eats data like crazy. I'm not doing anything different than I did with my last phone, Droid Maxx, and I had to upgrade for double the data already, the rep on the phone said all the newer smart phones eat data like that, pretty lame, cost me more money.:2017-03-24:slimn8
Samsung Galaxy S7:Absolutly recommend otterbox for this phone!:Great phone! Have not had any issues. But was sitting in a lawn chair and dropped it. Broke the outside shell! Phone works fine! Not a very durable build! Would not recommend going with out some sort of protective cover!:2017-03-23:turboblah
Samsung Galaxy S7:I need More Control.:The limits on volume minimum, prefer a lower level. Also it doesn't ring as long as the S6. It was cut in half and before I need five minutes for my job needs.:2017-03-22:Pumahoops
Samsung Galaxy S7:HAVING A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH A MAJOR FUNCTION:I needed a Phone with a speed capable ofgetting along with my new hearing aids.  My Note 4 was having real problems.  I am NOT a techy and don't need or want most of the grand new 'stuff'.I just have to relearn how to do what I want to do.  One of those things is the weekly notification of my 'groups' of the 'where and when' of some of our activities.  I can't do this if I can't send a 'group' text.  NO ONE, ANYWHERE, has been able to tell me how.  My mail box is full of offers to explain to me 'how to manage my data'!  I seldom use more than 0.5 Gb...that would be a high use month.:2017-03-19:MAD Madcap
Samsung Galaxy S7:Miss my I phone it's easy to use aND offers more:It is not as good as the iPhone wish I had chose the I phone it offers so much more and easy to use not liking my android:2017-03-19:Nina60
Samsung Galaxy S7:Its ok:Wont let u change certain functions the way you want them like sounds, notifications, and internet access. Had better options on the s4.:2017-03-19:Mr bacon
Samsung Galaxy S7:Too much stuff on these phones and not the basic function.:I can't find the things I want, so many extra added not needed and did I as for this.  You don't really want me to go on do you, just to get to 100 characters.:2017-03-17:Me the Customer
Samsung Galaxy S7:A Good Phone Overall:I had a Galaxy Note 4 before this phone and this S7 is simply just a simple upgrade from my old phone. The pics are a bit nicer and there are a few more fun features but nothing that I'm really incredibly impressed with.  It's another good quality Samsung Android phone and has all the basics that I expected.  Thanks!:2017-03-16:Jessicawilkny
Samsung Galaxy S7:Johnny Mack:Key functions are not aligned properly.   The use of the s5 are a lot easier to use.  Thus making phone easier to operate than the 7:2017-03-16:Bigboyctsv
Samsung Galaxy S7:great phone good features:This Samsung is a great deal nicer than the Samsung s3 that I replaced. I am still learning this phone. I am not a teenager so it takes me loanger:2017-03-16:Jake 123
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone. Bad battery.:"I upgraded to the S7 from my S6 since my S6 ""mysteriously"" got slow once the S7 and S7 Edge came out. Theven S7 is nice. I mainly got it for the water resistance. It's not much of an upgrade features wise. The battery is terrible! It drains a good 10% in 30 minutes or so just sitting. With the S7, portable charger is a must have if you're out and about.":2017-03-15:Reelinryan
Samsung Galaxy S7:Smaller than expected:Phone is a lot smaller than expected. Also the screen protector I bought with it dosent fit properly. It's like it wasn't made for the phone I purchased:2017-03-15:
Samsung Galaxy S7:More difficult to use than the S4:Very disappointed that it's so difficult to find features readily available on the S4. Bookmarks and downloads are 2 examples.  The S4 was very user friendly.  Miss that:2017-03-13:Ramor
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not a fan:Hate the text messaging. Miss my Droid, it was so much better and easier to use. Even this survey is too hard to send.:2017-03-11:dee1457
Samsung Galaxy S7:Dano:More bad than good to say so it wold take to much time to write it all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:2017-03-09:Dmartineau
Samsung Galaxy S7:Harder to use:Screen in smaller than I'm used to so harder to use. Changes made to the software which are not better, this is an Android issue.:2017-03-07:mrk1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Like it...but battery doesn't last!:I really like just about everything about my phone...except for the battery! I'm lucky to get through the day and I am not constantly using it.:2017-03-07:MikeyTbone
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not bad:Not bad, really wasn't worth the upgrade though. Pretty disappointed overall compared to my galaxy s5 .:2017-03-06:Ericl346y
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to roll over, nothing special though:I was expecting more features, longer battery life, and a noticeable upgrade from my S6. It really isn't anything special. Had I known I would have kept my S6 til next year.:2017-03-06:Zodiac187
Samsung Galaxy S7:Ok phone, but has some issues:Been using this phone now for 3 weeks.  It's ok and does what I need it to do, but i find it's slow and locks up.   Battery use is not as good as the droid I had and the speaking is a little more of the poor side.  Being able to add memory to the phone is great and the video and photo quality are above average.  Overall, the phones not bad, i just seems a little slow and wish the battery was a little better.:2017-03-04:Dave768584
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Camera & much better batter life than my old iPhone!:"This is a great phone though I'm on a massive learning curve coming from being an iPhone user, the functions of the phone are much better. High point: Camera and resolution. SO much better. Battery life also! If you play Pokemon Go, this is your phone!   Down side is that the audio isn't as good as my iPhone and its not as simple to use. Grateful I have a techie person to teach me!":2017-03-01:GreenJuice Girl
Samsung Galaxy S7:I liked the s4 more then my new one but that was because i knew where to find the apps i used the most:the screen protecter needs to fit the screen.  When you use the keyboard the letters on the side doesnt always register when touched because of the way the screen protector sits.:2017-03-01:Saundra4
Samsung Galaxy S7:Better features than the S3:Battery runs down way too fast. Just as bad or worse than my S3 which stunk. They need to do something about the batteries. They are horrible.:2017-02-28:bearessentials
Samsung Galaxy S7:Old Guy New phone:I'm an old guy with a new phone, this S7 will take me a while to get used to.  If you want honesty in your reviews don't make some blocks only 15 character long, and other mandatory at more than 100.   I might recommend the product, wouldn't recommend the review process.:2017-02-26:old White guy
Samsung Galaxy S7:I like the older version better:Verizon service is good and I do like the Galaxy but the S7  seems to be all over the place I had a S5 and liked it much better.  I have only been using it for a short time so my hopes will be it will get better with time.  Average use seems to be a bother more monotonous then it needs to be. Email seem to be more or a chore then they had been.  Not sure of the photos yet:2017-02-24:littledoe21
Samsung Galaxy S7:Fairly easy transition:I like that it is not much bigger than  my old phone.  I am still having trouble finding all my old information or where it is now located.:2017-02-24:Thisisstupidnoway
Samsung Galaxy S7:Bad battery life:The battery life is awful. Within a few hours you are down to 70% without doing anything. Expect more for the cost.:2017-02-22:wllspntkim
Samsung Galaxy S7:Sucks battery power like there's no tomorrow.:Uses far too much power, even in Power Saving mode. Speed and screen is fine, but when pulling down screen menu it often locks up for ten or more seconds before retracting. Extended battery makes phone thicker, which I like, but runs out of power far sooner than the Zero Lemon or Antec extended batteries on my older Galaxy phones. Maybe a future Android software upgrade will fix these problems. Maybe not. Starting to wish I'd gone with the Moto Force.:2017-02-22:JMStevens
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone is ok:Got this one as an upgrade for my s5. I really don't see any dig improvements over the s5. It is smaller and slimmer but the battery life is about the same.:2017-02-22:Gaf471
Samsung Galaxy S7:easy transition, however battery runs out twice as fast.:un-happy the battery dies so quickly.  I use it the same way I did my driod and it frustrating that by 3 pm the battery has 12%:2017-02-21:H2ogirl
Samsung Galaxy S7:disappointed:I am very disappointed with the video sharpness. My videos are fuzzy. Some features are more difficult than my s4. Hopefully I will be able to master some of these features. And my videos will get better because the camera is one of my most used features. Also wish that the screen was bigger.:2017-02-20:Miss Snoopy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice looking but echos in ear.:Nice looking phone. Has the galaxy 5 before this. Better features but phone calls echo in ear. I'm not as impressed as I thought.:2017-02-19:Supercasey00
Samsung Galaxy S7:Miss keyboard with numbers:I am disappointed that I have to go to another screen to type in the numbers and most of my passwords include numbers.:2017-02-18:Betty3102
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not really happy with Verizon or the S7:Not to happy with the way the phone is how slow it is and how it is hard to type on really nothing different than a basic Samsung phone. Not satisfied but stuck with it:2017-02-18:S7 review
Samsung Galaxy S7:Some issues with it:It seems fine except I keep getting the notification sound for a text and there is NO text! It's very annoying. So I turned all notification Tions off except Calendar. And it is now making that sound for emails, though I turned off nofifications!:2017-02-17:Allarah
Samsung Galaxy S7:Overwhelming at the moment.:I went from an Octane phone to the S7. It is a little overwhelming at the moment. I am sure that once I master it, I will love it. It is just very confusing at the moment. One thing is that I have to charge it everyday. I only charged the Octane once or twice a week. I am not even using the internet on the phone yet since I am sitting next to my computer. I have my emails turned off to save on the battery and still it is draining.:2017-02-16:chollows
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone could be better:Phone performance seems a little sluggish. Battery dies extremely quick compared to my S7active I had with AT&T:2017-02-16:Rickiebobby
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not an easy transition:Slim and lightweight battery talk time not long enough complicated to use, battery fast to charge, small texting lettering.:2017-02-13:deb512
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, but subpar customer service when signing up:The phone is a good improvement compared to the S5 model.  It also helps that the operating system is more recent.  The sound is much better compared to the S5.  The screen has a finer resolution, which is great.  The home button takes some getting used, but overall I like it.:2017-02-12:Cesar456
Samsung Galaxy S7:Trying to work with it:It's so  much info to work with. I came from Samsung Galaxy 3. **************************************:2017-02-11:s3 to s7
Samsung Galaxy S7:Mediocre:The button on the lower left of the screen, used to be a menu, for (options, settings, delete, & others). Now it just takes you to recently opened programs. I miss the menu, the widgit for (running programs), the ability to view recent calls such as (missed, placed, received, rejected) individualy!:2017-02-10:JHDub
Samsung Galaxy S7:Just OK. Buttons at bottom too bright, stock video app is glitchy:"After buying the phone on a Monday (new) and installing only a few apps, the video doesn't work sometimes until I restart the phone.  While this is usually not a big deal, I missed recording the birth of my niece due to this less than 5 days after purchase.  The phone was nearly tossed into the parking lot of the hospital.  I use the phone to watch videos at night in bed and the buttons at the bottom for ""back"" and ""apps"" are so bright they are blinding.  Dimming the screen has no effect on their brightness.  On my previous Droid, if I dimmed the screen, those buttons dimmed as well.  The camera takes nice pics, but is slow to respond which makes catching candid shots tricky.  Battery life seems good and the SD slot is wonderful.":2017-02-09:ShanAnnAnn
Samsung Galaxy S7:Early on...:"I have recently switched to the GS7 from my trusty Cap'n Kirk communicator(flip fone).  I was forced to do so as my cell provider is dumping the cell business.  I have spent about 30 minutes with the phone since I received it.  By the end of 2017, I expect I will have used it for at least ten hours total and will have a better idea of what it does.  I have little use for the fancy ""smart"" features of the product.  It is a phone, and it is seldom turned on.  This may change over time, but right now I miss my flip - which fit in my pocket better.":2017-02-09:Greg1001
Samsung Galaxy S7:Some good some bad:Galaxy s7 is not to much different from the s6 but it was all I could afford. Pluse the phone I really want was sold out.:2017-02-08:Kerri79
Samsung Galaxy S7:Beveled Edges - Ugghh:I'm frustrated by the shape of the screen- the beveled edges make finding a good screen protector very difficult and finding a screen protector that fully covers the screen impossible.:2017-02-05:SarahBeth design Bakker
Samsung Galaxy S7:Seems to drop calls not impressed:As I have talked to people keeps dropping calls and battery life is awful should have kept old phone but mic was going. Other places came back less hidden costs:2017-02-05:Flea1234
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not much improvement, some regression:"It's faster and smaller than my previous phone, but that was 4 1/2 years old, so while I'm impressed it eked along that long, it took forever to do many things, and frequently disconnected my calls.  This new phone is a lot faster, but the programs on it have changed to the worse:  colors are wrong, guessing what I want to type is often wrong and it won't let me correct its correction, notification sounds are not what I want.  I suppose I should blame the operating system and apps more than the physical phone;  I can't tell what I'm supposed to be reviewing, here.":2017-02-04:GrahamcrackerBell
Samsung Galaxy S7:Switching phones was easy.:Nice phone. It does the trick. Battery sucks. Less than 10 hours and the battery goes down to less than 20% available.:2017-02-04:AJ1960
Samsung Galaxy S7:Troubles with transfer:Not all of my photos were transferred initially  - lengthy process. Had a few crashes already - locked up screens. Hoping it gets better. Already had 'shortage of storage' message & it shouldn't be.:2017-02-03:AmandaManna
Samsung Galaxy S7:Hard to hear.:With the protruding glass screen a case is required, making it a tight fit in a shirt pocket. Using it with my Motorola roadster is rough. It is faster and the display is clearer. Sound is muffled, probably because the speakers point down. Creates problem with speakerphone.:2017-02-03:Shoelessjoe561
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not really sure how to work:My 1st smartphone and still trying to figure it out - so many preloaded apps and its confusing.   I'm sure once I figure it out and can put all the apps I don't use on a different page (because you can't delete them); I will be fine with it.:2017-02-02:booge7
Samsung Galaxy S7:Ok phone:Good features just network issues . Keypad to sensitive. My 7 active previous phone was a little better:2017-01-30:Dwbuffs
Samsung Galaxy S7:Personally loved the Galaxy 4:"Galaxy 7 is nice but I'm still learning it. I appreciate how quickly it charges, but its quite  different from the galaxy 4. ALOT bigger, which is a pro and a con.   It sometimes lags a bit, which makes me wonder if these are refurbished and not actually ""new"".  I definitely encourage looking at youtube videos to see different features the phone offers.  One complaint/annoyance is the charge screen shows an advertisement and I'm not sure how to get it off.":2017-01-30:Feee
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone, worst battery:Great night photos.  Easy to use for the most part. Only thing I hate about this thing is I have to charge it twice a day with moderate usage.:2017-01-30:Dlam
Samsung Galaxy S7:Replaced phone I had lost:The Droid platform, to me, is nice. The only criticism I have is the battery life lasts roughly 8-10 hours. That's with Bluetooth off and using WiFi for connectivity.:2017-01-29:Rickyk
Samsung Galaxy S7:Had phone issues just over a week later:The phone wouldn't charge and just shut down had to take it back to have them try to get it back on line.  They originally told me to take it to a larger store to have them see if they could do anything with it.  Then all of the sudden it started working again:2017-01-28:kitkat 1981
Samsung Galaxy S7:Can not get it to to connect through Bluetooth to radio:Can not get it to hook up to my blue tooth in my car with the radio but can talk through blue tooth very aggravating, would not have got this if I new about the issues galaxy was having with the bluetooth:2017-01-26:Trok1110
Samsung Galaxy S7:Okay Features!!!!:If you are coming from the Note 7. Don't waste your time with this phone. It sucks compare to the Note 7. Wait for the Note 8.... You will be glad that you did. If you are in need of a big phone. Try the iPhone 7 plus..:2017-01-26:Buffalo Soldier
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not happy with a few things:I absolutely hate the soft keys next to the home button. I also hate the fact that there isn't ANY tempered glass screen protectors out there that will cover the entire screen!! Also my alarm and ring tones changed on their own on the 2nd or 3rd day that I had the phone.:2017-01-24:Crippled fat guy 72
Samsung Galaxy S7:D:Decent phone. Ease of use is good.  Still wouldn't recommend the phone.     Other phones were better. Had to pick this one:2017-01-24:Dllccc
Samsung Galaxy S7:The store employee did not take the time to understand how I wanted my phone setup:Was not too happy with the store employee. He rushed me through set up my email for Gmail which I did not want I wanted to be set up using the Samsung email:2017-01-24:Rick11111111111111111
Samsung Galaxy S7:Average transition from S4mini.:It was average transition and I think the phone is functioning as expected.  It took two tries to transition all contacts and there seemed no pattern or explanation to what was not transferred.  I'm glad I live close to the purchase point so I didn't have to make a long trip to get it done a second time.:2017-01-23:nonb
Samsung Galaxy S7:At least it works.  Usually......:I knew I should have stuck with the iPhone.  Everyone was talking up the Galaxy S7, and I thought I would try it.  How bad could it be?  I've been very unhappy with the phone.  It is for sure not as 'user friendly' as the iPhone.  The Android version of all my apps are riddled with ads, so annoyingly so that it is difficult to do just about anything on the phone.  The ads automatically come up, then when I try to X out of it, it takes me completely out of what I was trying to get into in the first place.  Battery life was good the first week, but now doesn't hold a charge for the day.  Nobody can figure out why my battery is draining so fast.  I'm NOT a heavy cell user at all.  The camera is pretty cool and takes good pics, and the sound quality of the earpiece on a call is better than the iPhone.  I tried to exchange it for the iPhone 7 Plus, but I was on vacation for a week and lost track of time and by the time I returned, my 14 days were up!  Now I'm stuck for 2 years!:2017-01-23:Madams67
Samsung Galaxy S7:Came from LG G4... underwhelmed!:Firstly, my expectations may have been high since it was among the top 3 phones available at the time.  I was struck by the poor quality of the camera especially since it was touted as one of the best.  I actually thought I must've  had a plastic film over my camera to protect it in transit.  It did not.  I took several side by side shots with the g4 and s7 and the g4 seemed much more detailed.  The s7 was better in low light by far!  Also the s7 was faster... much faster!  I was disappointed in the swipe function on my eBay app which only seemed to work when it wanted to.  I also noticed that this phone seemed to be designed to be held in the left hand.  I hold mine right handed and find the button location irritating.  I also find the edges of the screen to be very sensitive to unwanted touch just from holding the phone my fingers would make contact with the slightly curved edges.  I will say to its benefit the WiFi works incredibly!  My g4 suffered from terrible WiFi connectivity!  This may be the only reason I haven't returned this device.  My g4 stopped working for no apparent reason and that was the only reason for the upgrade.  I will be waiting for a better phone to release and will be trading this in asap!:2017-01-22:Mdubya1
Samsung Galaxy S7:hard to set up and to BIG.:pretty gold phone but too long.. Texting feature wont let up see if your sent message was delivered on the screen immediately, my old core prime showed that. Dialing while driving can be touchy. more steps to make a call or check on stuff. Its an okay phone.:2017-01-22:Nashfox
Samsung Galaxy S7:This phone was a step down from my HTC M8.:Compared to my HTC M8, this phone seemed to lack an appealing operating system to me. I traded this phone for an I Phone 7, only because of my current work situation. Had it not been more or less a requirement for work, I would have traded it for an HTC 10. The HTC Sense operating system is far superior to any other phone that I have utilized.:2017-01-22:Not excited
Samsung Galaxy S7:Average:Phone is nice online purchase bad. Called customer svc also bad. Very disappponted with customers sby rep. Not helpful:2017-01-21:Xrlb1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Features ~ Was NOT an easy transition from my old phone.:Battery life is terrible if and when you need to use features other than texting or making and receiving phone calls.  You'll have to charge the phone at least twice a day if you need to learn how to use a smart phone.  The Verizon Store sold me an otter box.  It is very uncomfortable to hold and use.  Phones should be made less breakable without having to install at otter box protective cover.:2017-01-20:MrCAH
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not as nice as my last Samsung Galaxy Note 5:It's not as user friendly for office work and even for construction use as my note was. I am struggling with this phone, and hope I can become more efficient as time goes on. I would only recommend this phone to someone not using it for detailed work purposes.:2017-01-19:Lilneff05
Samsung Galaxy S7:No wireless charging base?:This should come with a wireless base charger AND a tool to get in the memory card compartment. I don't know how to access the card.:2017-01-19:Djdaveinpa
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy 7:I've had the new phone for a week and I'm not impressed with the battery life or screen protector. I thought a new phone would be better than the Galaxy 5s I just had, it seems to drain fast.  Also the screen protector in the store doesn't even cover the screen all the way, about an 1/8 of an inch on each side isn't covered.:2017-01-18:Galaxy 7 maybe worth it
Samsung Galaxy S7:Less data, same price.:Better battery life, nice having a wireless charger, but I cannot upload pictures from my phone to my computer.:2017-01-17:Mrw18661966
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery Dies quickly, for a new phone:It has all the bells and whistles you'd expect, except the phone lasts about as long as my old 6 did. I would expect a new phone to be a bit longer lasting than an older one!:2017-01-17:Mitia01
Samsung Galaxy S7:Big change for me:I replaced an iPhone 5c with this Samsung.  It has taken me some time to get used to the differences and get it set up to my satisfaction.  The battery life is very short compared to the iPhone.  Normal usage is mostly texts, maybe 20-25 a day, and a couple of 2-3 minute phone call,never used for video or music, and I have to charge it  every day.  If I had it to do over I would get another iPhone, I was very happy with it.:2017-01-14:kat9774
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy Smartphone 7:The phone gets hot that it is the only negative!!! I love Samsung products just not the battery for the devices!!@:2017-01-10:Beth Drawdy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy s7 is overheating!!!:Phone tends to overheat and battery doesn't seem to last. Thinking about switching phones. Would not recommend unless problem gets fixed.:2017-01-10:Tbradlly
Samsung Galaxy S7:Takes Grannies longer:It takes me too long to figure all of this out I need videos, or classes to help. At 70 Things take awhile sink in. Kids don't have time to help.:2017-01-10:NolansGG
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not happy:I started out with the motoZ and I loved it, but it had a glitch and after many many hours of being on the phone I had no choice at the time  but to settle for the Galaxy s7 and it's an ok phone but I really want the motoZ, without glitches:2017-01-09:JoshuaLee31
Samsung Galaxy S7:Whatever:I have Centurylink wifi; with my old galaxy 5, sound/voice would break up where I was unintelligible; now with galaxy 7 people tell me I still keep breaking up when talking????  Is it the phone, the wifi, or WHAT?:2017-01-07:galaxy7
Samsung Galaxy S7:I like my old s5 better:I don't see much difference between the s5 and the s7. The s5 was perfect until my 2 year contract was up and it died a month later. This has happened to me twice before. Curious:2017-01-07:Wildhorse1960
Samsung Galaxy S7:like to new features my old phone didn't have:three weeks in and love the phone except that the driving feature keeps turning itself back on after i turn it off:2017-01-06:ccrbadmoonrising
Samsung Galaxy S7:Ok for my needs:The device is ok for my needs, nothing difficult to use but nothing special either.  Color selection is limited.:2017-01-05:da628
Samsung Galaxy S7:Solely  Based on Battery life mehhh!!!:"Phone was charged all night. 6am today battery life was at 100% it's 7:47am and I'm down to 80%. Just traded my Pixel XL for the Galaxy s7 so far battery life is non compatible. #Missingmy pixel XLAlready :(":2017-01-05:Christinafeliciano22
Samsung Galaxy S7:Adequate:After you get all the unwanted baggage out of the way and/or off the phone, then it's a good deal.  You'd think they'd ask you what you want on there, instead of pushing a bunch of needless advertising down your throat.:2017-01-05:
Samsung Galaxy S7:great phone not happy with the screen saver:I bought this phone less than a month ago and the screen saver is coming a part already and I have never dropped it or abused it in any way. why is that?:2017-01-05:gilchris
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointed:I bought my phone a couple weeks ago and changed from an iPhone to this phone for the camera, which is anything but great. Might have to take it back. It's a lemon.:2017-01-04:known4laughter
Samsung Galaxy S7:Lukewarm on G7:The phone is very similar to the G5, which I liked a lot.  But I am really missing the infared blaster.  I totally expected to be able to use this phone as a TV remote, as I did with the old one.  Why in the world would Samsung take that away?  Other than that, no issues.:2017-01-04:1227Mari
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's not a Note 7:I bought this 3 months ago even though I wanted a note 7, oh well.  The battery drains fast even though I keep it on power save.  I thought a smaller phone might be more convenient, but I miss the bigger phone. On the good side this phone takes the best pictures I've ever seen on a cell phone.  The camera is easy to use also.  Videos are also good quality.  I hope the Note 8s come out soon!:2017-01-04:DSH49
Samsung Galaxy S7:Bright screen, excellent horse power, Android dissapointment:Chose the S7 because wireless charging built in and micro SD slot.  Very good speed and bright screen.  Problem is Google's Android, no apps will sync contacts with PC unless using MS Exchange, calendar and email works fine.  I read where Google contentious history with Microsoft is the problem. I miss my Windows 10 phone OS, but like the S7's horse power.  Lots of apps, but most not much good/buggy or for kids.:2017-01-04:3D0gs
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7:Same as s5. Should've been able to bring phone:2017-01-03:LLSTLS2000
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7:I had the S5 and I was pretty happy with it.  The battery life just got old and I was starting to have problems charging.  The S7 is nice but not much different than what I had.  So, I'm happy that it's consistently good, but not blown away by any new features.  Thumbs up!:2017-01-01:GaryAtum
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the phone, hate the battery:My battery  does not last long.  I have to charge my phone every afternoon, even when I have not been on my phone all day. It is not any better than my old phone that is 2 years old.:2017-01-01:FromHTCtoS7
Samsung Galaxy S7:I will be returning it for the second time as soon as the store opens.:I bought this phone, and although the features are very nice, calls are very unclear 75% of the time and sounds for texts no longer work. I exchanged it once already so plan to request a different model.:2017-01-01:Sasjwilliams
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone, has its cons:Phone is pretty good. Gets very hot at times, battery life isnt great:2017-01-01:Tony2014
Samsung Galaxy S7:Review billo137:Not really any better or worse than what I had before.:2016-12-31:billo137
Samsung Galaxy S7:Seems like a good phone, but haven't had it long.:Had it a couple weeks.  It's different from the Galaxy S3 it replaced.  Didn't get all files & apps copied from the old one. Still trying to find out how to get the rest on the new phone.  Lost a lot of old AOL messages that didn't come over from the old phone.  Some apps, etc. confusing to use in comparison to the s3. Like the old message app a lot more than the new one included in the phone.  Too limited and /or confusing.  Was happier once the old one was found and put to use. Need time to get used to new phone.  Would be able to make a better evaluation later.:2016-12-31:Rw894
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not nearly as good as my previous smart phone - Galaxy Note 3:"I find this phone not only difficult to read but difficult to hit the right letters/numbers when searching for something or texting. Where I can make the text bigger does help, but not everything on the page transfers to larger type. An example: on the contact list I can make the names bigger but not the alphabet letters running along the side where I need to choose another letter.  Also there are too many ads on the":2016-12-30:Buster10
Samsung Galaxy S7:average at best:phone is OK, but the speed when on wi-fi is very slow.  Also experienced difficulty in downloading music from my laotp to my new S&:2016-12-30:rich3189
Samsung Galaxy S7:still learning how to use it:saddened no user manual was with phone.  have had to have family help with how to answer the phone to how to  text to how to set up voice mail. sad.:2016-12-30:jane1987654
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointed Once Again with Samsung:This is my 3rd Galaxy.  I had the S3, S5 and now the S7, which I hesitant to purchase because of my experience with the first 2.  Now after only 3 short months my S7 is stalling, the battery is literally disappearing quickly.  In search for a new phone, by a new company.:2016-12-30:Tikira
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's okay:It's okay. I upgraded because my S3 wouldn't hold a charge for longer than 8 hours or so, and that's with a new battery.  It doesn't seem that much better than the S3, although the batter charges much faster and holds longer. I'm not impresses with anything else really though, the OS upgrades are annoying. Things work close to, but not quite the same way -- and with no noticeable improvement. Sometimes I think they make change just so you have something new to download but with little to no real improvement.  Don't upgrade unless you have to, or unless it's a amazing deal.:2016-12-30:JRR2
Samsung Galaxy S7:Difficult start up and transition:I've had the S7 about a week, already back to Verizon twice, first first activation, then for a simcard issue - I couldn't send any pictures and could not respond to group messages. Verizon needs to do a better initial quality check. Positives are longer battery life (bigger battery), speaker phone quality is excellent, and pictures are great. Transitioning from the old S4 to the S7 has not been easy. Deleting messages seemed easier on the S4 for an example.:2016-12-30:Bobz3
Samsung Galaxy S7:It gets too hot.:The phone becomes exceedingly hot after a few minutes.:2016-12-29:Disregard
Samsung Galaxy S7:Continuous ads trying to get me to download additional apps:No built in apps to clean junk, ram, etc.  I have gotten error messages telling me my battery is unprotected, that my memory is full, and my ram has viruses.  All want me to download an app to fix the problem.  This happens every time I turn my phone on.  VERY ANNOYING!!:2016-12-29:Annoyed in Texas
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not all cracked up to be...:Not impressed with battery life nor location of some feature settings from older phone.  Phone locks up once in a while.  phone only 1 week old.:2016-12-29:BAD00
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointed, liked Note3 much better:I thought a smaller phone would be ok, but I'm having a hard time adjusting to the difference. The exterior is so smooth it slips out of my hand constantly.  I text with both hands and my left hand invariably hits the wrong keys now. Excruciatingly slow to load pages and weak wifi retrieval.  And lastly, syncing the info between phones was more difficult than I'd experienced in the past.  This is the first time I've wanted to return a phone.:2016-12-29:DDracer
Samsung Galaxy S7:Big difference:Going from an iPhone 6 plus to an android based phone was quite the challenge. Still not sure this is right for me but will have to carry on until end of contract.:2016-12-29:Alfarmgurl
Samsung Galaxy S7:Poor battery life....:I've had the phone for about a week, the phone itself is nice, however the battery length sucks and the phone doesn't stay charged.:2016-12-29:Jcb77
Samsung Galaxy S7:Fast processor but Battery life sucks:Im not so happy with the battery or the new emojis, but the processor is faster than my S6 and the camera is really good:2016-12-28:CCmo
Samsung Galaxy S7:My new Galaxy phone Keeps turning off:I just bought this phone over a week ago and keeps turning off without notice. It may have full charge and I may be checking something and turns off. There's been occasions that it turns blue saying my device didn't start correct and I need to connect it to the computer so it can start properly.:2016-12-28:cgall16
Samsung Galaxy S7:Transition was easy but sound is muffled on the new phone.:Other than the sound of love the phone.:2016-12-27:Bizzybanks
Samsung Galaxy S7:Like Galaxy S5 better:I have had alot of problems with the S7, the messenger alert wouldn't work, rebooted back to factory, worked for a day then quit again, replaced with another brand new one and now I can't get the fingerprint security to work.  I was surprised that there wasn't much change between the S5 and S7:2016-12-27:dino1967
Samsung Galaxy S7:ok phone:Except for the Better camera, hardly any upgrade from the s5, was sold a defender case, waste of money. Almost impossible to use any pull down screens.:2016-12-27:nwj1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not really what I was looking for.:Not really impressed with all the apps that keep posing up and using a ton of data.:2016-12-26:Weaverjv76
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features:Only problems is tbe battery gets really hot and i cant keep a charge on it.:2016-12-26:Martinwil
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good camera:I miss my Galaxy 3s. I don't like the size of this phone. It's heavy. Also has bad reception. People can't hear me very well and I can't hear them either. Not happy.:2016-12-26:SaharaRoot
Samsung Galaxy S7:just a bit better than my s6:I am not positive if I want to even keep this one.:2016-12-24:Flaghorn Bluhat
Samsung Galaxy S7:Email:Email sucks. It keeps bringing up the same 8 or 10 hotmail emails as unread - multiple times a day, every day. They've been read but I don't want to delete them. Keep herring notice of unread emails. Kind of wish I'd kept theGalaxy 5:2016-12-24:Swainc2
Samsung Galaxy S7:Email setup:I have had the phone for about 1 week and dtill.cannot get it to read my email from Hotmail. It reads Gmail great.  Allows you to.load Hotmail.  Will even say it is talking to the mail server. But will not show any messages. New or old.:2016-12-23:Walt Maxwell
Samsung Galaxy S7:Randomly freezes:The phone kept freezing. Non of the buttons would work. It frooze for 6 hours. I took it to the Verizon store and tgey replaced it. Very happy about that but the new one has the same problem .... heading back to the store . Hopefully 3rd times a charm:2016-12-22:Samsung fan maybe
Samsung Galaxy S7:Voice Command:I don't like the way the voice command works and in general:2016-12-21:dakotalilly
Samsung Galaxy S7:Sleek & very speedy:I bought this phone less than a month ago & so far it is okay. I came from Verizon prepaid, to a contract phone. 3 gigabytes of data on prepaid lasted me 2 weeks. With the contract, for whatever reason I go thru data much quicker. I am unsure if it is because the phone is 4g (prepaid phone was 4g) or if it is because my old phone was not as updated. So far, I am not particularly fond of how quickly it burns data.   The only issue mechanically I have with the phone is that the home button has stuck very inconviently since day one. If I try to hang up a call & the button gets stuck or sticks, the screen flashes & glitches & I am unable to hang the call up.:2016-12-21:Fleesh
Samsung Galaxy S7:Poor battery:I love certain things such as wireless charging but the battery sucks  within 5 minutes after charging it dross 5%  in 8 hours down to 2%:2016-12-20:Drbennett58
Samsung Galaxy S7:I should not have spent the money, the S7 is just newer:While it is great to have a new phone, I should have just cleared out the memory of the S5 I had and gotten a couple of new batteries.  For me, the S7 has not shown anything new and different from what I had, in the way I use a phone.  The texting seems harder, it does not understand spaces between words, so I am always having to go back and clean up anything. And the autocorrect is a mess.     It came with the quick charge station, which sometimes does, though more often does not actually charge the phone.  So Yeah, I got a new phone.  Now for the next 24 months, I will be paying for it. And as I say with a car, you should be happy when you write that check, not sure I will be in this case.:2016-12-20:wwhopper
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointed in battery life:I'm disappointed in battery life.  It doesn't last 24 hours and I don't stream videos or do anything that uses a lot of data.:2016-12-18:danser
Samsung Galaxy S7:Ok:I'm happy with this phone. I had so many problems with the multiple Note 4's I had that anything would be better:2016-12-15:Animal rescuer
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery life isn't great...:I can use it for a day and then have to charge it.  If I put it on power saving (which limits performance) it might not die by 9pm. Other than that is a good phone with great features.:2016-12-14:Ohionurse517
Samsung Galaxy S7:Don't like Chrome being the only option. Doesn't get 4g as well as my Galaxy S4.:I'm not happy about the lack of reception this S7 gets. I would also like to have a choice other than Chrome, which seems to be only connected to my Gmail account.:2016-12-13:Katoomer
Samsung Galaxy S7:same as s5 that we traded so far.:We traded our galaxy S5's and so far everything seems to be the same Except the cases are very Slippery!:2016-12-13:tired60
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not a bad phone.:The phone is good for what it is, but nothing like the Note 7 I had.:2016-12-12:Xionation
Samsung Galaxy S7:I still have a lot to learn.:Hard to teach an old dog new tricks.:2016-12-10:Beso
Samsung Galaxy S7:Transition was complicated:The phone was a bit complicated to transition to. Didn't work at first, I had to call Verizon. I was told my apps etc would transfer, but never did. I'm an Etsy seller and my Etsy app doesn't work like it did on the S4. Frankly, I'm struggling to see what has been upgraded other than the size of the screen. The fingerprint lock is also a pain which doesn't work half the time.:2016-12-10:blindlemon
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not user friendly:I have an S3 and it is very user friendly... I have yet ... after two weeks to figure out to install Skype and FB on my new S7.:2016-12-10:prmichaud57
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7:I bought this a couple weeks ago and pretty satisfied however my headphones don't work and can't talk & text.:2016-12-09:Grammy905
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not sure yet:I've only had this phone for about a month now, but I miss my Motorola Droid.  This phone is a lot smaller than I am used to so when I'm in the middle of typing something my hand accidentally hits another part of the screen, causing it to close everything out.  I also find the emojis to be odd looking.  I dont really care for the ringtones on here.  The only good thing i can say so far is the camera is decent.  Everyone keeps telling me I am going to love it, but I am still waiting on that.:2016-12-09:Amanda138
Samsung Galaxy S7:Hopefully the waterproofing works out:After having a Motorola phone Samsung's voice assistant is terrible. The battery seems to drain really fast when I'm actually doing stuff on my phone like browsing xcetera. Also I have had some pretty disappointing selfies so far:2016-12-09:HairyWookie808
Samsung Galaxy S7:Wanted More:I had to trade in my Note 7 and was left with this.  Its ok but of course its NOOOO comparison to my Note.  Hopefully Samsung will offer some type of incentive when the S8 releases next year.:2016-12-08:Destro
Samsung Galaxy S7:Issues with wifi:Upgraded from s5 to s7. Ithe constantly drops the connection when using streaming appreciate like Pandora.  I'll be contacting support.:2016-12-08:Izzys mom
Samsung Galaxy S7:Average Phone after Having the Note 7 for a Few Months:I, like everyone else was forced to get a new phone after the Note 7 fiasco.  I looked at many phones and none of them were that great compared to the Note.  Samsung was offering a $100 for another Samsung device so I went the S7 Edge.:2016-12-08:chaddymack
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone so far.:Love the phone but keep getting a notification for incomplete activation. Verizon is sending a new simple card, hopefully that is a fix.:2016-12-08:Ferdman
Samsung Galaxy S7:Beautiful phone:I've had the phone for  3 weeks now.  It was simple to transfer all my email contacts, pictures and text messages from my old Samsung S5 to my new S7. I have much trouble taking the phone from my pocket or purse to answer a call.  The call gets terminated and I am sure I am touching something wrong when I pick the phone up.  Very frustrating.  Other than that, the phone is fine for my simple and minimal needs.:2016-12-07:Brooklyngranny
Samsung Galaxy S7:Decent phone with nice options:I've had this phone for a few weeks now....overall it gets the job done but it often gets very hot to the touch:2016-12-07:ChadATG
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features, small screen:Smaller then the s6 edge plus that I had by far:2016-12-07:Siobhan84
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung s7 review:Ok, I have had the phone for almost 2 weeks and these are my observations. The first glaring sore thumb is the battery. It charges wireless perfect. However, after very mild daily use, the battery drains down to 50% by the time I get home from work and I barely use it. Another problem is that when waking the screen, sometimes it just turns off immediately  after waking it. Those are my issues. Another then that, the phone operates as expected.:2016-12-07:Wonroc
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7:Battery drains fast, no IR TX/RX, overpriced like just about everything on this planet.:2016-12-07:Colonel Crispy
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7:Don't really see any difference from the S6:2016-12-07:Tbignuts
Samsung Galaxy S7:Novemeber 2017 Galaxy S7:I moved to this phone after over 3 years with a Motorola Droid Maxx.  it's a little bit of a letdown, it's a little bit faster, in the screen is a little bit better but the battery still barely makes it through a 16 hour day. If I talk  on it for more than 45 minutes  during the day I will have to charge it when I get home at 6 PM. It does offer quick charging which is nice but I would've preferred 4000 mA  battery instead of the 3000 mA installed in the thing. The Motorola phone was an upgrade from an HTC,  which was pretty lousy. I guess I expected more  from the galaxy  instead it feels like a lateral move. On the  upside  at least the galaxy doesn't randomly reboot itself once or twice a day.:2016-12-07:BigDaddyBenz
Samsung Galaxy S7:Blah:Phone and company aren't what they used to be:2016-12-06:PROFESSOR X
Samsung Galaxy S7:S5 change to S7:Great camera and display:2016-12-06:Billybobloran
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good camera:I was overdue for an upgrade and when this phone had a good promotion, I upgraded from a Galaxy S5. I don't like this phone as much - I find that my old phone was more user-friendly, but the camera is definitely sharper on this phone. I hate that the phone is smaller and find adjusting to the now-narrower keyboard a pain.  Otherwise it's ok, like pretty much every Galaxy.:2016-12-06:Marquee
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's a phone. Works. Nothing special:S5 was great s7 is basically same phone:2016-12-06:55rfy75rx
Samsung Galaxy S7:Its decent for what it is.:I ended up with this phone after the Note 7 recall.  It is alright as phones go and if I wasn't used to the more comfortable screen size and awesome stylus of the Note 7 then I'd probably have given this product a higher review.  Basically its the phone I'm stuck with instead of the phone I truly desired.:2016-12-05:Lucas Texas
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not easy to make transition.:I cannot get it to connect to my PC.:2016-12-05:nailerman
Samsung Galaxy S7:Miss my old (Galaxy 4):Have had the Galaxy S7 for 2 weeks now.  Not as easy to use as my old Galaxy S4:2016-12-05:Too old to learn
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not much better than my previous phone.:Some contact information was lost in transfer.:2016-12-05:rnrcowboy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not for my purposes....:I'm in an (rural) area where coverage is intermittent. For some reason there is no AT&The coverage at my home. There is reception with Verizon, but the signal reception  was better for my Galaxy S5 than it is for my S7.:2016-12-05:stuartamonteath
Samsung Galaxy S7:Pretty much operates same as other Galaxy:Easy to use, nothing spectacular.... very disappointed in the camera and battery life kind of short.:2016-12-04:Jch112
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointed in S7:"Good: more storage,   Irritating: predicated spelling is awful. Phone won't learn my correct emails, continually puts the wrong mail service with the wrong name.":2016-12-04:ELTM
Samsung Galaxy S7:Curved screen makes finding a good screen protector difficult:"Phone is fine, but the S7 screen is curved, making it next to impossible to find a good glass screen protector that provides anything close to full protection without a loss of touch sensitivity and/or image quality.  I'm on my 4th different brand at this point and none work as well as the protector on my S6.  The best sensitivity/screen image protectors do not attempt to cover the curved edge, leaving roughly 3/16""-1/4"" unprotected all around and putting the edge of the protector clearly in the screen image.  The fullest coverage products will cover the entire screen, but tend to cause rainbow distortion in the center (due to adhesion problems) and also have sensitivity problems around the perimeter of the screen.  In short, I may have to go back to a film protector for this, and I don't think the minor increased performance over the S6 makes the S7 worth that pain, so I may return the S7 and purchase the less expensive S6.  To summarize a long post... if you don't care about using a screen protector, or don't have a problem with the wet apply/film type protectors, then the S7 is fine.  If you have gotten used to the superior protection and usability of glass protectors (like me), then the S7 is a disappointment.":2016-12-04:dasman66
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not very happy with my new phone:Talked into switching from iPhone to Galaxy and not very pleased with the Galaxy S7:2016-12-04:Natashapruett
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy  7:Upgrade to the Samsung 7:2016-12-04:Nikki3
Samsung Galaxy S7:Mobile Connectivity Not Good:Other than below average mobile connectivity, the phone is great.   Had better connectivity with previous S5 and older phones from Verizon.:2016-12-04:larflint
Samsung Galaxy S7:New g7:I don't really see a lot of big changes. The battery isn't really lasting all day.  No IR BLASTER? What was Samsung thinking?:2016-12-04:Dawnnis
Samsung Galaxy S7:Thought it would be an easy transition....:Battery not what I expected....sound keeps going into silent mode.......:2016-12-04:DebbieStein
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice Phone with terrible music audio:Phone is fine but first thing I noticed on the drive home was how terrible it sounded in the car vs. the G3 I traded in. Boomy low end with a ratty, distorting top end. I wish I hadn't traded in the G3 and kept it as a music player. Had to do a lot of tweaking just to make it bearable, not great. Also noticed the power plugs, center contact was bent down and you couldn't get the charger in unless at a decent angle to wedge in. Exchanged the phone as I figured this would eventually break. Replacement was the same and worse in one day. The audio is the same whether you use Bluetooth or the headphone jack, so some folks who might think it's just a poor DAC or headphone jack related, it's not. If you love your music and want it coming from your phone, look elsewhere. I'll live with it, as I primarily wanted to lower the bill but the S7 is a disappointment. If there had been a promo on the iPhone 6s, I would have been all over it instead.:2016-12-04:Skoora
Samsung Galaxy S7:Bring back small Androids!!!:It is very disappointing that Verizon has totally abandoned small android smartphones. The only small phone you sell is an Apple, and some of us dislike Apple's products. We cannot choose the phone we'd actually prefer, because Verizon does not bring any onto their  networks.:2016-12-04:sovurclenfcjmsdfkczl
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone but could use a better front camera:I bought a few weeks ago. It is a pretty good phone, however; I would like to have a better rear camera. The phone overall is nice.:2016-12-04:Logdog
Samsung Galaxy S7:Upgraded from S6 and not impressed:I upgraded from the Galaxy S6 and so far have only noticed two things diffrent... one good and one bad! The good is it takes a micro SD card now, which is great because I used all 32 GB in my S6 within the first 6 months of owning it! The bad is the new S7 freezes up on me when I have 4 or 5 programs running and I have to wait minutes before it even lets me use the home key or to power it off and back on again. The S6 would literally run twice the amount of programs and it NEVER froze up! Maybe I got an S7 with programming issues and I need to get a replacement.:2016-12-03:Broncofandj
Samsung Galaxy S7:power drainer:I like the phone design and features but I'm amazed buy the amount of charging this phone seems to require. On days where I don't even use it , the phone drains 45% battery life. My previous phone went 3-4 days without even thinking of needing a charge:2016-12-03:Klarkie
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's ok:It is the same as the galaxy s4. Do not like the camera:2016-12-03:Sis1rose
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7:Bought it a week ago:2016-12-03:Rickbob
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not bad:Confusing  takes awhile to figure out where things are at ???:2016-12-03:Reload1416
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone, neat features, but overpriced:Just got the phone about a week ago, im enjoying the newer apps and battery life but not a whole lot different than the S4 I was using. Overall I like it but not worth the price:2016-12-03:jessika628
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice but there are days I wish I bought the moto z play instead.:I can't complain about the performance of the phone other than it doesn't last long enough. My wife and I both have the same problem; it dies faster than our old phones. We both have to hit the charger on the way home or it won't last through dinner. My G3 and her S5 both had about 15% more power at the end if the day. (35% vs 20%)  Fast charging is great.... If your job let's you have your own charger you can plug into at will. I am away from my desk most of the time. And I don't know how much the fast chargers hurt the longevity of the battery.:2016-12-03:James m
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy s7:Doesn't  always unlock:2016-12-03:Red90
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone:Well to start I got rid of my S5 and purchased the S7. Well I like some of the new things but there is some things I do not like..the S7 is very similar to the S5 in a lot of ways but the S7 has a better camera, more storage space and a few other nice things. Now the bad...I have to say I have dropped more calls with the S7 and data seems to be slower and WiFi is a lot slower! I'm not super happy so far but I've only had the phone a short period of time. I wouldn't recommend this phone.:2016-12-01:Jackson270
Samsung Galaxy S7:nothing but problems.:I bought the phone a little over a week ago and I'm ready to return it.:2016-12-01:ajparkes
Samsung Galaxy S7:Ok phone, verizon network is pricy.:It does the job, but really is nothing special compared to other flagship phones out there.:2016-11-30:Micro Nate
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice compact but.....:Very disappointed in the battery life. Use for work and have to charge each night old s5 when new would go 2 almost 3 days between charges:2016-11-29:Mustang08
Samsung Galaxy S7:Only one commplaint:Battery charge does not last a full day even with closing apps.  Motorola Droid had a much better battery life.  Camera is superb!:2016-11-28:Katep
Samsung Galaxy S7:Keep hitting  the volume button on left side!! Lots of time I miss phone call because I did not realize  the volume was down@!@:Volume button on left side keep ,hitting it not realizing  I hit it. Not the best lay out !:2016-11-28:Gssman
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy 7:Photoso are OK not what I was expecting  Wish it had ano option like Siri or Google assist especially while driving  Wish it had talk to text:2016-11-28:MrsMelissaHoward
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not much different than my old S5.:Not sure why this is considered an upgrade. I like my old S5 better. The S7 seems to have a connection issue with Internet. My wife's S6 has better connection than me new S7.:2016-11-27:Ddub61
Samsung Galaxy S7:Review:Had to get new phone after some coffee was spilled on mine!:2016-11-27:JMG review
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not the Active:I wish this was the Galaxy S7 Active, but right now that phone is exclusive through AT&T. I am constantly lyrics worried about dropping my phone.:2016-11-26:WoshJills
Samsung Galaxy S7:Overrated and Under Impressed:"Purchased an iPhone 6S via an upgrade three weeks ago after having been a Galaxy Girl. Wasn't really thrilled but the hype pushed me to try it. Didn't work out so retVurned it at day 9 for the GS 7.  After all the reviews thought I now had a gem.  ""NOT"" !!! ,   This phone lags, photos are grainy,back button has to be pressed more than once to get it going, the home button feels cheap and the gold framing moves and slides from one side to the other leaving a space between the button and the framing. I am a senior and handle this thing with kid gloves so why is it making me feel Samsung is being careless and throwing these new phones together so fast to suck us in. I would rather still use my GS 4 plastic and all if only my dog didn't knock it out of my hand and it landed in the sink full of water. It was the best phone of all. Stable, fast and beautiful photos. I am very disappointed .  If it were possible I would return it in a minute but now that time ran out I'm stuck.  Going to try to find a GS 4 in great condition !":2016-11-26:Bx Gal
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone is just OK:I had the Samsung Active before I purchased this phone. The Active is by far the better phone. I wish Verizon offered it:2016-11-23:2L84me
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7:I have had it a week. Works the same as my S5. Gets extremely hot with any update. Therefore needs to be left off at 15 minutes after any update to cool down.:2016-11-23:jmorehouse79
Samsung Galaxy S7:Ok:Little pricey but overall a good phone:2016-11-21:Redreindeer
Samsung Galaxy S7:Working still to figure out:Hoping this  phone will work well for me:2016-11-20:Linda do
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not pleased with new s7:This is my 3rd Samsung phone and each one gets better but still have way to much extra stuff on phone. And the s7 is slow and 2 things open is very slow:2016-11-17:James 2016
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's a good phone. Miss  my galaxy s5:I love Samsung Galaxy phones I've had all of the except for the s6. I got the s7 and it nice but it seems to be slow lags. And there's a bunch I don't like about the phone. And the things I do like don't other out weigh the bad. After this phonew looking for a new brand of phone.:2016-11-17:Jxdubbs
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good upgrade:Petty happy with new S7, except placement of power on/off button. Why was it moved down? On my S5 the button was higher up the phone and never a problem. On the S7 it's now lower on the phone, the button is where you might comfortably grip the phone so now I'm occasionally turning it off. Sometimes a pain to turn back on, swipe code and resume whatever I was doing.:2016-11-12:Nonicknameloser666
Samsung Galaxy S7:Preferred My Samsung Note:I like my Samsung Note  better, the Galaxy 7 just doesn't compare in my opinion. I also like my iPhone 7 Plus better.:2016-11-12:CHRSH101
Samsung Galaxy S7:Transfer of information from old I-phone easlily done:I bought it, can't say I'm really happy with it.:2016-11-11:alfred berg
Samsung Galaxy S7:Bright screen and graphics. However having very hard time trying to lean. Has not been an easy transition for me:Have had new device for a week. Not an easy transition. I don't think it's very user friendly:2016-11-11:Piper001
Samsung Galaxy S7:Upgrade:Like the phone. Love the clarity of the camera. However, I seem to always touch the side letters on the keyboard with my palm, which is annoying.:2016-11-09:Jmint
Samsung Galaxy S7:A bit disappointing:There was much confusion to the TRUTH about battery life with Samsung Galaxy 7. I was told it was much better than s4. Not true. I have to charge it daily. Also often now I have been using keyboard to write an email and my phone will suddenly shut off.  I could not find the normal voice mail....and it is confusing that there is also a Verizon one that costs extra.....I can't get rid of it! I do like the camera. All said, I have had my phone for just a week and am not totally used to it yet.:2016-11-09:Deb J
Samsung Galaxy S7:Camera takes very good pictures.  Learning curve to finding things and navigating is a bit tiresome  but I'm not a techie.:I like the large screen.  The pictures are good quality.  My difficulty is finding things as they are a bit different than the Droid I had previous to this phone.:2016-11-08:LLR1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Transition was ok:I bought this a week ago, I really would have preferred another galaxy note but none were available. The s7 is much smaller, harder to see and size makes more difficult to use key board. Not thrilled with it.:2016-11-06:Tamara nc
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointed:Happy with the lesser number of useless apps (compared to at&t). Unhappy with the lack of ability to turn off of certain apps, the curved screen and the inability to have a tempered glass screen protector, and the unreactive keyboard/ screen that is related to the screen protector the sales pertain took upon themselves to add and put in my phone without asking.:2016-11-06:Tinman17
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great except the Bluetooth doesn't work:Love the new Samsung Galaxy S7 except that the bluetooth doesn't work. When i scan for devices, it doesn't pick up a single device. Pretty upsetting because I use bluetooth headphones all the time.:2016-11-06:ColinR
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy s7:well I bought it couple days ago think I am going to have to send for different one ...every time I  go to  different page ..it flips back to  previous like I hit back button...:2016-11-05:rtgomtewr5
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesome phone, terrible battery:This phone is replacing one of the wonderful note 7s that I had to return. Being from apple originally I have grown to love the operating system.  The biggest and only complaint is the battery. I have to charge it to make it through the day.:2016-10-26:Dover sales
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice, but too many prompts at inopportune times:Every day it asks me to set up some feature that I don't want and repeatedly asks the same question. Facebook comments freeze frequently since I got this phone.  Also, everything requires my location to be turned on to work.  That was not a required permission previously.:2016-10-26:Stacy1965
Samsung Galaxy S7:Is okay NOT A NOTE FOR SURE:Was NOT my first choice. Had to return my note 7 and this was pretty much ALL they had!:2016-10-26:Sidepocket70
Samsung Galaxy S7:It will do.:I got the Samsung S7 to replace my Samsung Note 7 that had been recalled. The S7 is a nice phone, but a bit small for me. I preferred the size and features of the Note 7, but until they come up with a replacement this will do.:2016-10-25:Bowtieguy60
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good but complex:Good phone overall. Not very user friendly at first but once you get used to it and have time to look into it, it's great. Compatible with almost anything I've tried to use. The phone seems way too complex at first. The battery gets really hot really fats so that is discouraging:2016-10-24:Stanzie
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7:I wanted a note and since the note 7 was recalled I asked about a note 5 and they said they had none anywhere for me to get so this is a cause they had nothing else I wanted phone:2016-10-24:Mudkicker999
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery Life is not the Greatest:Samsung 7 battery is not any better than my Samsung 4.  Was told service would be better too and that is not true.:2016-10-24:Chilli74
Samsung Galaxy S7:I needed a new phone:Decent phone, battery drains quickly:2016-10-24:TAMW
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not as Durable as My S5:While I enjoy the sleek design of the S7, I'm disappointed in it's durability. I had my S5 for over 2 years without a case. It was dropped on concrete and gravel, ran through the washing machine, and put through the elements. It held up well with just a few scratches. I have had the S7 for one week and the screen is already cracked. It wasn't dropped or sat on but simply cracked while in my pocket. The crack renders the water resistance capabilities useless which was a key reason for choosing this phone. Not impressed.:2016-10-23:JDM3036
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's ok:I bought this phone a week ago.   It is exactly like my s4 except all the aps are  not easy to find.  Everything is grouped together now making it more confusing:2016-10-23:19283746564738291
Samsung Galaxy S7:9284043642:Don't really like this S7, gets hot and hardly use.  Don't think battery charges any faster, not much different from S5:2016-10-23:Lcentorbi
Samsung Galaxy S7:Slow:Looks nice and all but my galaxy s5 is more light weight and definitely faster on the Internet:2016-10-22:pwampj123
Samsung Galaxy S7:Definitely a downgrade from the note 7.:After having a note 5 then 7 getting the s7 feels like a step down.:2016-10-22:Bringbackmynote
Samsung Galaxy S7:Like some things and don't like some:I wish the blacklist feature was on this phone like others in messeges. Don't have the option like other cell phone carriers. Also, downloaded several message apps that didn't work that other ppl use. Don't like radio either compared to itunes.:2016-10-21:
Samsung Galaxy S7:Ok:Loved my note 7←_← better this is OK:2016-10-21:MIC72
Samsung Galaxy S7:Settled for s7 from a note7.  Not happy:Turned in my note7 and best buy didn't have any s7edge to replace it with.  Said they could get them but I'd be without a phone for a week.  Not willing to forgo a phone for a week I settled for what they had to offer....an s7.  had to buy a new case, it's much smaller, loss of functionality from the note7, now Ill have to have this for 2 years and I'm already unhappy with it.  Not a happy camper.  Not sure about what to do with this account with 7 lines on it.  Would be great if customer service would try to make things right/better.:2016-10-21:rksapp64
Samsung Galaxy S7:Ehhh...:Upgraded my phone from an s5 to the s7 and it was an easy transition. One major con is that there is no way to adjust the screen/keyboard sensitivity. You could calibrate the screen on the older models, and although you can d/l screen sensitivity apps, they don't really work.:2016-10-19:Svturtle
Samsung Galaxy S7:Likes the s6 better:I bought this phone a few weeks ago. I had the s4 and s6 before this phone and was extremely happy with thone two so I wanted to try the s7. I'm not as please with this one as I was with the other 2. This one over heats, freezes and is alot slower then the other 2. Also, I was disappointed that  they took the remote controller app out. It's not a horrible phone just not as satisfied as I was with the other 2 I have owned:2016-10-19:Kris86
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not as good as S5:I recently upgraded to the S7 as my old S5 was having some software issues. I have to say while the S7 has some nice features, the camera and water resistance at the top of that list, I don't like it as well as my S5. Overall it just feels like many of the apps require more clicks to get to your end result than the S5 did, particularly with texts and calendars.  Primarily, my phone is a phone. I use the phone, calendar and text features and a little bit as a camera. It is not a gaming device or mobile internet surfing device for me generally. I use the text feature almost as often as I talk. I find the text apps on the S7 more cumbersome. It requires more steps to delete messages and the auto-correct feature is my new nemesis. Super cool when I have typed correctly the word I want and it gets changed. This becomes a battle of wills and ultimately the check mark wins. It is frustrating that it requires several clicks to tell the phone that yes, indeed I am not incapable. To delete a text requires pulling down an additional menu and confirming at least twice that you want the text deleted. So happy my phone has my back and wants to really verify that I know what I'm talking about.  All kidding and minor annoyances aside,  the camera on this phone is a decent quality. I am a DSLR camera person so no cell phone out there right now matches that for me but for a cell phone camera I find the S7 convenient and sharp with some nice editing features. I do like the low light option and found that it does well without being blurry or overly saturated with background light. Having additional storage for those photos and music files is also a great feature.  Ultimately, in this day and age, to cling to an old favorite is like insisting your old vinyl was better than your iPod and digital downloads. To each their own, technology moves forward anyway. For me personally, I don't like having the extra steps on my text apps and calendar. I liked my S5 but as I grow to know the S7 I'm sure I'll adjust. It just makes me feel better to whine about the good ol' days.:2016-10-19:EliMacRN
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not really impressed.:After shattering my screen on my LG G4, I was talked into this Galaxy S7. I miss having an extra battery  to exchange, not liking features  !either. It feels like I'm missing things, like my widgets, my quick keys that I can add that I actually use. Design is a bit slippery, great for displaying fingerprints. Will definitely invest in cover/case. Just seems like a plain, mediocre, fragile phone.:2016-10-18:Eviilems
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice features, but frustrated about wireless connections and screen protector.:The phone itself is nice, clean, and easy to use. I am a little frustrated because it won't connect to my home network for more than a minute or two, and I can't seem to figure out why. Also, there isn't a tempered glass screen protector for this phone - well, there is, but it doesn't stick on all the way and the edges peel up. Other than that, the service is excellent and every time I've been to the store, I've had amazing assistance in every aspect. I just wish it would connect to my dang internet!:2016-10-18:aefelker
Samsung Galaxy S7:Quality Performance, design lacking.:"in terms of performance, the phone is an absolute winner.  Few people could argue against that.  Its a samsung and its pricetag is set high for a reason.  The downside however is the design.  The glass screen has mildly curved edges, even though its not an ""S7 Edge"".  While that may look kind of neat. it has the unfortunate side effect of not allowing many cases and screen protectors to work together harmoniously.  Usually cases easily push off the edges of screen protectors and not allowing them to stick properly to the curved edges causing the screen protector to get air bubbles and dust underneath it.":2016-10-17:JonathanR
Samsung Galaxy S7:No problems with the phone:I have found the S7 is fairly easy to use but the battery doesn't seem to stay charged for very long and I can't swap/charge it with a charged battery as I did with my previous Lumia phone. I also have to remove the phone cover every time I want to use my Gear VR:2016-10-17:netacoma2003
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery life is the only thing that sucks so far:So the phone was easy to transition to from my old S5 but I was upgrading hoping to get better battery life as a few hard years on my S5 had taken it's toll and the phone was only lasting half a day anymore.  Well unfortunately with hard use that's all that I can get out of my week old s7 as well.  I really like the wireless charging though and the fast charger is a savior of a phone that can drain it's battery as fast as this.:2016-10-17:Bbqthat
Samsung Galaxy S7:Happy with everything about the Samsung Galaxy S7 phone EXCEPT the battery life.:The phone works well, and lives up to most of the hype from on-line reviews.  Unfortunately, the battery life with daily use for me ranges between 4 to 5 hours.  This is much less than my previous S5 or my partner's S6; and much less than manufacturer specs.  Recharging it so often during the day is a bit frustrating.:2016-10-15:SmithE
Samsung Galaxy S7:Same phone as the 5:I don't notice any difference in the galaxy 5 and the new galaxy 7. With the exception that my new phone charges and holds a charger better & longer (new battery!).:2016-10-13:CanYouHearMeNowCustomer
Samsung Galaxy S7:Simple to use lots of features:Got the phone two weeks ago and love it easy to use:2016-10-11:Trucker Ed
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not much better than my S6:Bought the phone less than a month ago. I thought that the camera would be better. The phone is OK, but I may go with another brand on my next upgrade.:2016-10-10:Mawof8
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not a lot of difference:I got this phone about 2 weeks ago after having a Samsung Galaxy 4 and I can't really tell that much of a difference the display graphics are better a little brighter this speaker is louder and I love the ability to charge wirelessly however to be a brand new version I was expecting something more I decided to not get the edge because the salesman told me it had a greater possibility of screen damage with the edge being curved overall I feel it's just a newer version of the phone I had I did get the Gold version and everyone who sees it loves it it's more of a rose gold is soft and it's beautiful but the fact that it's basically just a shiny version of my S4 is the reason I only gave it three stars:2016-10-09:Missberlyb
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use:Good phone. Only down fall is the battery drains way to fast, constantly have to charge.:2016-10-08:Deerhides
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointed in reduced features:"My last phone was an LG G2, which was faster to charge wirelessly, which had an IR blaster, which let me double click the screen to sleep and wake-up, and which had the buttons on the back where I could reach them. I bought the Samsung, because LG ditched all these features. The S7 also lacks these features and is only better in that it cable charges very fast. At least it can charge wirelessly, even though it's slower than the old LG. The new LGs cannot even charge wirelessly. The camera is supposed to be better, but I'll never notice a difference probably. The buttons are on the side where they are hard to reach instead of on the back like the G2. The new Android lacks a lot of the convenience of old Android: no media volume control in the drop-down, less customization in the drop-down, etc. It's just very disappointing that the latest and greatest is missing so many features and adds seemingly nothing.":2016-10-07:Luke348934
Samsung Galaxy S7:A 3 star (for now):I'm really trying to figure out all the features and and I'm sure it will improve in my rating.  I seriously wish it came with an instruction manual. I don't own  a computer and/or printer. I'm hopeful that one would miraculously appear in my mailbox.:2016-10-05:Shebon
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's a phone.:It does all the neat things you want a smart phone to do! I like the size and the ease of use. I switched from 3 years with a Motorola phone and the biggest thing I miss is the Home Button. The only way to get back to the home screen on this phone is by hitting the back button (which is on the opposite side from the Motorola - and so are the volume controls). This is annoying. Other than that, it holds a charge really well, it is really fast operating and the camera's clarity and features are great. It's compact size and weight are also very nice:2016-10-05:Scudz
Samsung Galaxy S7:note 7 replacement:I got this phone after the note 7 recall. Was a little gun shy on the note 7. there were other issues with the not. Call quality was poor, call reception was poor and internal speaker not up to par. So i switched to samsung s7. I do no tlike its small size, after years of being a note user I will just have to struggle with the unit until the note 8 arrives.:2016-10-03:gunner1170
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone:Bought the s7 2 weeks ago. I like it for the most part.  Wish it were easier to find some features/controls.:2016-10-02:Fancee_face71
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery Life is Too Short:I am happy with everything but the battery life.  Plus, to make matters worse the charger cord as came out easy twice in the last few weeks.:2016-10-01:TerryShanon
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not happy with battery:I bought this a week ago and the battery lasts no better using Pandora than my 2 year old note 4:2016-09-28:Deanhumphrey56
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, disappointed with the curve of the screen:I owned a S5, S6, and now S7 successively with Verizon. The disappointing thing with this S7 phone is the screen is curved slightly downward at the edges. It is not a practical design. If you read the reviews on all the screen protectors for the S7, all get poor reviews. They won't fit proper. My Zagg glass screen protector does not contact on the edges, it is a pain when trying to type and such, and dust is constantly under the protector edges. A case which encompasses the entire phone, such as a Otterbox Defender which I used for my S6, will not work well. The screen protector will not lay flat on the screen causing touch issues and allowing dust to get under the screen. Poor design on Samsung's part to curve the screen.:2016-09-28:Matt in Alaska
Samsung Galaxy S7:Okay:It's  just a cellphone:2016-09-26:Richarfg
Samsung Galaxy S7:General overview.:"Upgraded to the S7 recently. Overall great piece of technology, my compliments. Although some changes weren't exactly an improvement in my opinion.  Many inconveniences: *needing a tool to access the SIM and memory cards, *not being able to remove the back cover, *not being able to rotate through the home and subsequent screens.":2016-09-24:Lzike05
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy s7 is ok phone:I have had the s7 two weeks and not satisfied with the s7 at all. tomuch phone for my use.:2016-09-24:ruther420
Samsung Galaxy S7:It was an easy transition from my last phone:"I rwally enjoy the features of this phone, however, there are some downsides: the battery does not last as long as advertised, and my signal strength and connection strength is not as strong on this phone as it was with my galaxy s5":2016-09-24:Beanbear
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone:It's a nice phone, just not sure it's worth the price. I'm still learning. I must say though that it is quite difficult to transfer contacts and calendars to the new phone. But, I guess that doesn't have to do with the phone itself.:2016-09-24:Gatornorm
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's an okay phone:Switched from S6 that failed to 7 not much difference in phones:2016-09-21:Justforthisstuff
Samsung Galaxy S7:A lemon?:I loved my Samsung 3; I loved my Samsung 5.  I want to love my Samsung 7, but -- at least not yet.  The battery life is unsatisfactory.  The tech rep I spoke with today encouraged me to trade it in - I'm in the 14-day window.  I have an appointment tomorrow to do just that; hopefully then I will be able to give it the same 5 stars I've given previous Samsungs.:2016-09-19:New Dawn
Samsung Galaxy S7:good phone:phone is good battery life is pretty poor:2016-09-19:strglide2120
Samsung Galaxy S7:OK:I was really hoping the wifi calling feature worked. I have owned a S5 for years and just upgraded to the S7. I hardly get a Verizon signal at my home so calls drop all the time. The wifi calling feature was disabled on my S5 by Verizon. The S7 has it and it rarely connects to wifi for calls. I still have dropped calls, I think the S5 had better reception.  This phone has a lot of great features, but if it doesn't perform making calls it's really not worth it.:2016-09-19:RaleighNC2016
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery:Phone works well except for battery. Even with WiFi, location & Bluetooth turned off, charge is gone in less than 1 day:2016-09-18:Why this
Samsung Galaxy S7:Hard transision from last smart phone.:"I bought this because sales girl said it was easy to use (Like last smart phone) I asked if it had a flashlight and GPS and fast picture taking. It does have a good camera. However, this phone is way more complicated than what I needed. I have yet to find a flashlight. The sound is way to low on my alarm and ring. Also I can't hardly hear my text. Phone is very heavy. Battery runs down quickly! I had a Samsung galaxy mini before which I loved (except the camera isn't as good as this one) Not Happy :-(   Should of went with apple.":2016-09-15:smartshopper12
Samsung Galaxy S7:OK Phone:"I like the wireless charging and the waterproof features, but other than that, not much different than my S5. Disappointed that the screen is smaller, and the sceen protector doesn't een cover the screen to the edges. I am having problems with it and will be taking it back to the store to be checked out: It ocassionally goes dead in the middle of a phone conversation, and it doesn't notify me of text messages-no ring, no vibration, no flashing indicator light.  Dicovered this when people started calling me to see if I had received their text as I hadn't responded to them.":2016-09-15:Combat 41
Samsung Galaxy S7:Newer than my classic:Need more time of usage.  Had a classic for a long time.:2016-09-14:Ana0108
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not as good a as my old LG G3:I couldn't take the knock on feature any longer. Hated taking pictures inside my pocket. Because it was a Verizon phone I was unable to disable that feature. This phone will have to do for 2 years.:2016-09-14:LARRs
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, limited service coverage, hot battery:"I was very happy with the s5 however was excited to receive the new s7. The phone does operate smoothly, camera is wonderful. 2 concerns though: 1. I had way better service coverage with the s5 2. The battery does get really hot after charging or hours of use. Very disappointed as this makes me question the safety of the s7.":2016-09-14:Cbess327
Samsung Galaxy S7:overall a good phone:Not to bad, the screen protector makes it hard to get the right button without pressing very hard:2016-09-13:none122364567
Samsung Galaxy S7:Why isn't there an instruction book to this phone?  I've had it for 7 weeks and I still cannot use all of the features.  Some are very confusing.:I have returned to the Verizon salespersons at 2 different locations and have called the company several times.  Everyone answers the questions that I ask, but there are always more questions and no way to find answers on my own. The phone has made my life more complicated, not easier.:2016-09-13:Millie3
Samsung Galaxy S7:Keep s5:Not that much different than the s5:2016-09-13:Red022481
Samsung Galaxy S7:Its ok. Not at all close to all the hype it got.:I was expecting a whole lot more with this phone but its not much different from my galaxy 5. Its not any faster as far as internet speeds and one of my fav remote control apps doesnt even work on this one. Just another expensive phone:2016-09-12:Dbonz
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features but battery life is not what I expected:The S7 is a great upgrade from the S5, however the battery life is not much better than the 2 year old S5...... Disappointing!!:2016-09-12:Raypcote
Samsung Galaxy S7:Poor battery life:Bought this phone 3 weeks ago. The battery life is horrible.  Can only last half a day, which is very inconvenient.   Charging takes longer than the galaxy 5.  Not a fan of how to insert the sd card.     Everything else seems like the galaxy 5:2016-09-10:Ladancer
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features but it get hot:I like the phone but it heats up...:2016-09-10:lilsneeezie
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not intuitive:Only have had it for about a week and it's a problem.  Not intuitive at all.  It seems they have tried to improve it to the extent I don't recognize it from my old phone.  Don't  like it:2016-09-09:Mikie21
Samsung Galaxy S7:Liked my 6 better.:It's the little things.  Ring tones, alarm clock works different, signal weaker. Verizon is getting $20 miter a month.:2016-09-09:elizabethks
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone except for battery:I got this phone last week after reading lots of reviews and talking to friends that have it.  I had an older model Galaxy before my previous phone and I really liked it so I felt like it was a good decision to go back to the Galaxy.  I wish I would have believed almost every review that I read that talked about how bad the battery life is.  I don't feel that I use my phone much.  I don't stream music, I rarely watch videos and if I do they are less than 5 minutes, I check my email, text and use a few social media apps.  After 10 hours my battery is around 30%......with minimal use.  I hate having to carry a back up charger with me wherever I go.  It's not convenient and I know it will only get worse as the phone gets older.  If you need your phone to last all day and you actually use your phone, I wouldn't suggest this model.:2016-09-09:ladjms
Samsung Galaxy S7:New to me will probably get better:Changed from 4s only had a wk or so learning:2016-09-07:Mradams
Samsung Galaxy S7:.Battery life poor:Battery life is not very good. Hardly gets through the day and I am not using it that much:2016-09-07:DASD
Samsung Galaxy S7:Having trouble:I just bought the Samsung S7 last week and half the time when I answer the phone I can't hear whoever is calling me and when I make calls they can't hear me or I can't hear them and there's a loud buzzing on the other end of the line. Took it to Verizon and we switch the SIM card and that didn't fix it so now I'm going to have to return it since I'm still in my 14 day window to return.:2016-09-03:toddhutto
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesome features:"I really like the new features but they took away some of my features I always used :/":2016-09-02:Britt777
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's okay:It's a Galaxy phone, works fine.:2016-08-31:Reaganomics
Samsung Galaxy S7:Missing a lot of stuff my S5 had:Car Mode and SVoice come to mind.  Downloaded Car Mode and it doesn't work as well as it did on S5.  Maybe there are replacements that are better I haven't looked yet and I'll probably have to dl and install vs. S5 they just were.  So far the S7 out performs the S5, but otherwise, for the money spent, I am not impressed.:2016-08-30:Hibish
Samsung Galaxy S7:Like the phone, wish it would play am/fm radio.:I like the battery life it's awesome, I wonder how long it will stay that way. I like the speed of it to. I am confused about why the S7 from Verizon won't play fm /am radio with an app, when it will for the other carrier's. This means I have to stream music and news or carry a separate radio to listen to the local stuff. I'm not sure if this is by design or an oversight? I hope that they can fix this.:2016-08-26:James R
Samsung Galaxy S7:Sometimes to HOT to handle:Got a few days ago. Kinda don't like how hot it gets but other than that I guess it's oksy. Still learning it.:2016-08-24:BrandyCamacho
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good, but not great. Didn't really live up to my expectations.:I recently replaced my Samsung Galaxy S5 with the Galaxy S7 since my phone was eligible for an upgrade. I was excited to transition over to the S7 since I've heard so many good things about it.   The first thing I noticed was that the audio for both media and calls sound a bit off compared to the S5. Not much I can say about it. You have the option to optimize the audio to your liking. Even after some tinkering, I really didn't think it made that much of a difference.   Another big thing I noticed was the battery life. I've had to charge my phone about three to five times in one day. Plus, it takes a very long time to charge even after claiming that it's supposed to charge relatively quickly. I started charging my phone at 47%, and an hour later, it's only at 52%. I feel like my S5 charged faster and lasted longer.   On the bright side, the picture and video quality is awesome. But for someone that streams a lot of videos on Twitch, YouTube, Netflix, and Hulu... I rely on long-lasting battery life and good audio. Again, not too impressed.:2016-08-17:amsyo_
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not a fan:I came to Samsung from iPhone and cannot wait to go back to an iPhone.  I did not find this an easy transition, usage feels clumsy to me.  I had to change settings in 2 places to get them to work.  The camera quality is great.  Call quality is not.  Constantly dropping calls even if I am standing in one place not moving.:2016-08-16:negurl
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy 7:It's complicated to use.  I think I should have went with Apple phone as everyone says it's easier to use.  No quick access commands:2016-08-16:MRF7
Samsung Galaxy S7:More expensive that Verizon estimated and lost features I counted on.  Do not understand all the upfront charges.  Not as easy to use.:Adequate phone.  Too expensive.  Not as easy to use:2016-08-15:Chipmunk2529
Samsung Galaxy S7:no,had some trouble:It's a nice phone....kind of sorry i gave up my Iphone:2016-08-14:bassetwd
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice Phone But......:Nice phone and the camera is ok, but the battery life is awful. I sometimes have to recharge 2x in one day and that's with minimal usage. Keep Screen Turned Off feature doesn't work. Wish I could alphabetically organize my home screen apps without having to touch and drag them.  I would recommend to a friend but with reservations.:2016-08-13:Americangirl
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone, not as easy to use:I love the clarity and quality of the phone. It looks great and seems fairly durable. I don't like the size (too small) and the touchscreen seems to not be very sensitive which can make it difficult to use at times.:2016-08-13:No thanks
Samsung Galaxy S7:Screen is too small. Keep hitting apps because of less room between display and edge of phone:Doesn't have enough options to change your home screen. Miss the LG's 4th screen. Don't like that notifications have to be attended to before you can get to home screen:2016-08-12:clp7
Samsung Galaxy S7:still on the fence:just got mine about a week ago and not at all happy with the battery life or its overall performance:2016-08-12:fred63
Samsung Galaxy S7:Ok:The phone is OK.  All these phones and plans are overpriced.:2016-08-12:Beth12ann
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy 7:replaced a Motorola Razor Maxx with a Samsung Galaxy 7.  The difference in battery life is unbelievable.  The Samsung is terrible.  Motorola would last 2-3 days, Samsung won't get through 1 day. Nice phone, terrible battery!:2016-08-11:tom2200
Samsung Galaxy S7:The Software Features are A Disappointment:Beautiful screen!   Love the size!  Very disappointed in the Marshmallow OS! The picture editing software is a downgrade from Galaxy S4 with the Lollipop OS. The built-in equalizer lacks options, again, compared to the Galaxy S4 with the Lollipop OS. Display settings offer more great options but took away some other useful settings.   Bottom line, I'm paying for a higher definition screen with less options than the Galaxy S4 with the Lollipop OS.:2016-08-11:DaNTeK
Samsung Galaxy S7:Mixed Feelings about this phone -- Great Camera but weak battery and phone signal:I would recommend the phone with a few reservations.  The phone reception is not as good as my HTC M8 and the battery does not make it through the day on normal usage.  I only text, use the phone and check email.  I heard good things about the battery life but do not agree.  I have to say that I'm disappointed so far.  Its only been a week but I expect the battery life will only get worse as I use it more.:2016-08-10:PaulZogr
Samsung Galaxy S7:Drops more calls than S5:"We live Rural and the amount of dropped calls has tripled :(":2016-08-09:Jetzoner
Samsung Galaxy S7:poor reception:Switched from iPhone6 and while I really like the camera and many more of the features I'm very disappointed with the reception. I experience dropped calls and poor reception in the exact same areas where I never had them in the past.:2016-08-09:mhuf
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice Samsung.  Good touch sensitivity.  Lags on media and gameplay.:Nice Samsung.  Good touch sensitivity.  Lags on media and gameplay.:2016-08-08:BryanG2016
Samsung Galaxy S7:Somewhat disappointed:I have had my new phone for almost 2 weeks and while I like the size and some of the features., I am not as happy with it as I should be.  Some of the features I expected are not on it and some of the ringtones and alert tones are not what they advertise.   I wish I had the option to change to a different phone, but I fear I am stuck with this one.:2016-08-08:judi1225
Samsung Galaxy S7:12073635144:Somewhat happy, I love my phone  but not happy with reception:2016-08-08:dchase1830
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung 7 - not up to the hype in the advertisements:Nothing really new from my old phone except for more memory which is a good thing.:2016-08-08:Mikes750
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice size. Easy to pair with bluetooth:I bought two phones 10 days ago and they're our first smart phones. We have had to find our own way with the simplest of things and would really appreciate a printed users manual in the form of a small but comprehensive professionally printed book. You cheaped out with the minimally useful quick start guide that came with them. I found the complete manual online, but cannot print it out due to time, size, and cost constraints with regard to paper and toner. Very disappointing in that my husband and I have both been contacted by text message from a Samsung/BestBuy service rep They inquired if we were happy with our phones and our experience. I inquired about a manual. Although their original message indicated that we would be contacted within the next business day, I've yet to receive any response at all. You must be really concerned about our satisfaction with these phones. Not. I can't accurately respond to the following opinions because I don't know how many of the features work.:2016-08-07:p2p2p2
Samsung Galaxy S7:Still some bugs for a new phone:"I have had a lot of dropped calls and data network unavailable errors during the first week. Also, many people tell me that my voice sounds ""tinny or metallic"" on calls.":2016-08-07:ChrisCh
Samsung Galaxy S7:everything is good except the battery life:I bought this phone less than 2 weeks ago. it is a good phone and it does charge fast. the only thing I do not like is that the battery also dies fast:2016-08-06:JEN98617
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's okay:It's okay if don't like  the fact that it doesn't have the menu button .but still it's ok:2016-08-06:Rayray4242
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone . . . EXCEPT:"Gorgeous screen, easy to navigate, amazing photos, fun voice features.  BUT IT HAS HUGE DRAWBACK: You won't know anyone has left you a voice message unless you have data turned on.  So much for economizing by only using WiFi.  Because voice message notifications will not come through the phone connection or a WiFi connection.  I was told that only by having data turned on will I get notice that someone has left a phone message.  So when traveling overseas, unless you're wealthy and can buy a lot of data access, you won't ever know if you have voice mail unless you continuously dial in.  Why on earth did they change the voice mail system so that a phone connection alone is not enough, but you HAVE to have data turned on??":2016-08-05:VT123
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not All I had Hoped For:Traded in my Iphone 5C and the antenna was so much better on the Iphone.  I think the antenna in the Galaxy7 is weak.  The large size takes getting used to also.:2016-08-05:Ejohnson
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone but confusing after using iphone.:"Some aspects of this phone are great such as: easy connection to google, uploading music, deleting numbers, ability to increase memory, and easy to use camera. On the negative sides: the app buttons are confusing and all over, the constant flashing light on the front is annoying, the message system is ridiculous with floating dots and multisystems to use, this phone also doesnt have motion pictures. Overall i think its good but could use some work.":2016-08-05:Katelyn1
Samsung Galaxy S7:I did not have any of my memo app transferred successfully. This really upsets me.:Memo app ink.. Or ink pad does not transfer your old data to your new phone. It is lost in air space. Twice this has happened and very very annoying.:2016-08-05:Verizon MB2016
Samsung Galaxy S7:This has not been an easy transition.:There are so many things I don't understand about the use of this phone.  Why wasn't there an instruction book with it?  I've tried using the Help icon,but it's not very clear. And why don't  all the icons appear all the time?:2016-08-04:Jo Bob
Samsung Galaxy S7:Sr. Admnistrative Assistant:Have owned the S7 for 2-3 weeks, works well but not that there is a WOW factor.  Not sure what was improved other than added memory.:2016-08-03:mgoolsby51
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung S7:The S7 does not function as well as the Iphone 6s did. While making a phone call, and need to type in an extension, the screen will go in and out making it difficult to type in the extension, very frustating.:2016-08-03:ski70
Samsung Galaxy S7:Part great,part not so great:Bought 7/27. Contact list transferred,but without email addresses. Not good. Had class today& still no way to fix it.:2016-08-03:Shushy
Samsung Galaxy S7:A Little Disappointed:I purchased the Galaxy 7 online and am a bit disappointed that it' not much different than my 5.:2016-08-03:Deesun9
Samsung Galaxy S7:No real improvement above S5. No removable battery, smaller size, went back to micro charger cable so all S5 cables will no longer work.:Keep your S5 and add the wireless charger adapter.:2016-08-02:No phone
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nothing special:Just used my upgrade from note 5.  I'm disappointed mainly in the speed of the phone.  It is much slower at handling simple things  then my note 5.  Other then that the phone is OK.  The camera is OK but still seems to note compare to the note.:2016-08-02:Clayton27
Samsung Galaxy S7:Okay phone:The phone is nice, easily to use. Screen is beautiful, pictures clear and crisp. Battery life is awful. I had it on battery savings mode while i slept and the battry went down 40% when i didnt even touch it for 7 hrs. Yes it charges quickly but that does me no good when i have to charge it 3x a day and i dont even use it for facebook. I took i back and got a iphone S+ now i am happy with the iphone, the charge lasting well over 48hrs. If battery is important this is NOT the phone for you!!!!:2016-07-31:Leigh A
Samsung Galaxy S7:Better than galaxy 3 but:Many features are better than my old galaxy 3 but some are actually worse. The Bluetooth streaming to my accord isn't very good, takes forever to connect, doesn't show info on the cars display like the 3 does. The battery is way worse, had the galaxy 3 for 6 years and the battery still lasted longer than the 7. The camera is easy better on the 7. The music player isn't as good as the 3,the speaker was better on the 3. So over all I like the 7 but they should have left a lot alone.:2016-07-30:damorg
Samsung Galaxy S7:Seems the same to me except water resistant:I don't see the difference except the water portion. Kinda sad I bought it:2016-07-30:Gigihn
Samsung Galaxy S7:Doesn't meet expectations:Phone is too complex:2016-07-30:Vznrvwr1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy s7:Purchased just under two weeks ago:2016-07-30:CassandriaG
Samsung Galaxy S7:Camera No So Good:Like the phone.  Camera isn't very good.:2016-07-30:jba3
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone:It's easy to use.  The coverage is great.  There is some freeze up with games. Still so much to explore on it though.:2016-07-29:Sahri
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone, not yet fully featured:I thought since this phone was almost a year old it would have been perfected by now. I'm not pleased with the battery life and I can't get a spare like I have in the past.  However the bigger issue is the fact I can't sync up to the many Bluetooth devices in our home. That is very disappointing. Fix this phone.:2016-07-28:Rich D 1972
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy s7:I bought this phone to replace a phone who's battery was overheating and so far I liked my other phone better.:2016-07-28:Nikki Finney 70
Samsung Galaxy S7:Upgrade necessary:It's okay.  Not many changes from my old phone.:2016-07-28:Ngjones
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Features  Slow Learner:I like that this phone has large viewing screen, as my old flip phone didn't.  I know once I get used to the new features I will be very happy with them, its just getting use to the S7 vs the flip phone that I had had for 8 years.  It will take a little while for the change to be comfortable or automatic.   Everyone around me has these phones and loves them so I know that in a short time I will also.:2016-07-28:Early Dawn
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good basic smartphone:I have had it for a week, as the title  states it is a good  basic smartphone. Others in my family always have better reception than I do.:2016-07-28:MoGal_70_
Samsung Galaxy S7:Avg.:We got 2 Samsung Galaxy 7's smartphoneso to replace 2 Galaxy 5's smartphones. We have  had them for about a week, nice phones.:2016-07-27:WK77
Samsung Galaxy S7:it's ok:I am having some problems with it:2016-07-27:ellie bundy
Samsung Galaxy S7:OK:I upgraded from an S5 and the phones are very similar.  For some reason, however, the calendar on the new phone is very difficult.  Although my phone is set up for Eastern time zone, the preset time zone for notifications was Korean! So all notifications were a day earlier.  The phone also made every event one hour later than input.:2016-07-27:Bellrnger
Samsung Galaxy S7:Over heating:It's a great phone other than u can only use it for a few min. No Internet time or gaming time due to it get too hot to even hold:2016-07-27:Gomez1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy s7 in Sugar Land TX:Whereas the Samsung Galaxy s4 didn't drop a single call in years, my brand new s7 drops almost every single call I make/receive from home.:2016-07-27:skehs01
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung  7:Too hard to figure out that feature changeS:2016-07-26:Mugglees
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointed so far:After reading many reviews, I was really looking forward to getting this phone.  Photos up close are sharp and beautiful, but at a distance, they are out of focus.  There also seems to be a delay when not up close with perfect bright lighting between pressing the shutter button and the photo being taken.  Many functions seem very complicated, like just getting the photos from the device to the computer.  It is SO easy with every other device I have.  With others, you just plug in the USB cord and the computer recognizes it just as though it were a jump drive.  I still haven't figured out how to easily do it with the Samsung Galaxy S7.  I tried it with the Google Drive and that was a disaster.  It didn't download all the pictures, just some.  And, if there were pictures taken with the burst mode, it only downloaded one of the photos of the group.  Everything else has also been complicated to figure out.  I've only had the phone for about a week, so I'm not sure if I'll be able to learn everything or give up and get something else.:2016-07-26:travelertoo
Samsung Galaxy S7:Can't get all my pics and stuff  from old phone took 4 gb to transfer phones:Keeps just needing to update everything I don't feel it should if it's new. 3× the first week??!!:2016-07-26:Mitchell77
Samsung Galaxy S7:Gets really hot randomly.:That pretty much says it.:2016-07-26:Jpobri
Samsung Galaxy S7:I Had This Phone 1 week!:The screen already has a Crack in It! I have no idea how this happened! I have not dropped this phone 1 time! Taking it in today! I had a Motorola X and another Samsung phone before that never ever had a Crack in either phones! This is the most expensive phone I have ever had and in a week the screen gets a Crack!:2016-07-26:Toddsgurl71
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung S7:Screen is not durable and I have gorilla glass and a tempered glass on it. Screen sensitivity is very high and even if I am holding my phone in my hand, the screen is responding to opening or selecting items.:2016-07-25:MySamsungS7
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not happy:I upgraded from the galaxy 5. Im not happy with the 3g i get in my house.  Its the same service, just a new phone & icant get clear calls in my house. . I had Verizon change the SD card, but it didn't help. My husband phone is doing the same thing.  It may have something to do with being water proof. I wish i would have kept my 5.:2016-07-25:Poptart555
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good design  but needs communication skills like Droid systems:The keys are too small. I like the camera:2016-07-24:
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone. Bad reception:Had a iPhone before and drive in areas that have very little signal and the s7. Was loosing signal a lot more than the iPhone:2016-07-24:Mower man
Samsung Galaxy S7:Too many features. Difficult to manage:Good phone too many popular ups:2016-07-24:Tang55
Samsung Galaxy S7:Was a terrible transferring contents from old phone to new phone.:Difficult time and many issues with new phone. Website WAS NOT a help. Was going to take it back & reactivate my old one. Damon Larson was on duty and SUCCESSFULLY transferred everything over and showed me a few tricks/options and I am using the phone. Many apps / ease to find options worked smoothly on old phone Samsung Galaxy 3, HOWEVER technology wants to improve/redesign  thereby making a simple steps become  extremely complicated.:2016-07-23:N L M
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's okay:Purchased the phone several weeks ago, it's okay for the most part. Not really impressed with it that much.:2016-07-23:By Tor 62
Samsung Galaxy S7:poor reception:Since upgrading my phone to Galaxy 7, I now have a small spot in my house that gets good reception. The data continually runs, even when I have completely closed all apps. My bill is constantly over in data, funny, no one can determine why. Not happy.:2016-07-23:bara
Samsung Galaxy S7:a little disappointed:The phone is quite buggy and requires restarts quite often to just get a call to go through.:2016-07-23:ETDG
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not sure yet!:I just got the phone within the last week.  Most things are easy to transition in to, but I can't find a way to keep my Bluetooth active in the car. It synced but every time I shut the car off, I have to turn on the Bluetooth and select my car.  Previous phone allowed me to turn on the blue tooth and it stayed on until I deactivated it from the phone I do like the thumb print feature and the camera is awesome:2016-07-22:JAO6423
Samsung Galaxy S7:Some apps seem to be worse:I use Pandora a lot and once I bought this phone I've had nothing but problems trying to listen to music using my own WiFi at home.  It only plays one song and buffers til I either open the application or change the station.  I've never had this problem before.  It also seems to have a hard time picking up some bluetooth items.:2016-07-22:Country_Gal27379
Samsung Galaxy S7:Buyer's remorse:I loved it until I figured out there's no IR blaster. Now I wish I hadn't traded in my S5.:2016-07-22:Roll Tide
Samsung Galaxy S7:Pretty easy to use:The reception is not as good as my old Galaxy Mini 4. Phone calls cut in and out for no reason where my old one never did this. Kind of disappointed in this.:2016-07-21:tracy0117
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features...many errors:"I have had the phone for a week.  Although I like the functionality,  I am having several errors: phone completely freezing, pics not sending through text, and there was a 2 hr span where I could not send texts.  I restarted the phone 5 times and force stopped the app.   Nothing fixed the issue.  As soon as I would click the text area to begin typing, the would get the spinning circle for minutes until it gave me an error message. Then, out of the blue, it started working.  As of now, pic messages still will not send.":2016-07-20:Cruises8
Samsung Galaxy S7:I think my S5 was better.:I had an S5, and before that a Droid, and never dropped calls.  My co-worker has an S6 Edge, and never drops calls.  This one drops the sound so people can't hear me but I hear them.  Only at work.  It also has trouble loading websites, even on Wi-fi.:2016-07-20:Any nickname works
Samsung Galaxy S7:Had high hopes.:I have had this phone for about 3 months now, and have had to hard reset it once already. This phone will restart on it's own at least once a day. The camera is awesome, and when everything works the phone is great. Might need to trade this for another, thinking it may be defective.:2016-07-20:AJ Link
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not any better than the Galazy S5:Nothing about it seems any better then the S5 version. In fact, they took away the ability to swap out batteries so you could argue it's a downgrade. And with the curve on the screen edge, if you have a screen protector like any sensible person does, it makes it harder to interact with the edges.:2016-07-20:space39
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not all I had expected..:I had two Motorola phones that I loved. Unfortunately, within a year of using them they both began to break down. Within two years, they each stopped working all together.  I picked up the new Samsung Galaxy s7 with the hope that it was a better piece of electronics. I've had the phone less than two weeks, and I'm not very happy. The battery wears down in half the time of the Motorola, and it doesn't have a few of the features I really loved the most in my previous two phones.. Yes, the Galaxy does have some cool features my Motorola did not have, but if I had to do it again, I would have picked out a third Motorola, even though the last two died after 18 months.. Only time will tell if this Galaxy last longer than the others..:2016-07-19:NEW YORKER
Samsung Galaxy S7:Incredibly hard to transfer data from s4:Nice...hard to get use to.:2016-07-19:Bad Boys Bill
Samsung Galaxy S7:phone review:Phone to big and bulky:2016-07-18:harry37
Samsung Galaxy S7:a bit disappointed:I updated my phone since my phone was 3 years old and not holding a charge very well. I have had my new phone 1 week and I feel like my old phone held a charge just as well. I am on vacation and can't do much before losing charge. I have to only use it in emergency is what I feel like.:2016-07-17:baseball mom
Samsung Galaxy S7:Note 5 to S7 Edge not the best switch:The edge has no real functional value. It doesn't reduce steps for tasks... It is the same number of steps. It really only can reduce clutter on the main screens. By holding the device in one hand,  touching the edge just to hold the phone interferes with desired touch gestures and scrolling.:2016-07-17:Justechmo
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not so great!:I bought this phone less than 14days and I am having 2nd doubtshift about it.it keep freezing up on me and powering down.:2016-07-16:Chefgeo
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use....but other issues.:"Battery is much worse than the s5 and the reception seems to be worse than the s5.  Not sure exactly what they ""improved"" on, but so far it has escaped me.":2016-07-16:JMS81
Samsung Galaxy S7:Okay:Pretty to look at, but it's a little awkward  to handle .  The power button is too low on  the side  so I am always accidentally turning the screen off. The device  is top heavy  and drops out  of my hands uunexpectedly. Otherwise not a bad phone .:2016-07-16:Angie 777
Samsung Galaxy S7:Still transitioning from iphone:Screen is so close to hand and causes mistyping  seems more sensitive.  Hate blue bubble gizmo. All of a sudden auto punctuation  disappeared. Like back button.  Like screen very much  and camera:2016-07-16:Newclay
Samsung Galaxy S7:very confusing, need a training program. not really happy with new phone.:hard to understand for rookies. very complicated.:2016-07-15:don 300
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery time:I was having a problem with my old phone and its battery losing charge within 12 hrs. I am an average user. I was told that this phone would solve my battery, it didn't. I last maybe 15 hrs. I am not happy.:2016-07-15:rrm2
Samsung Galaxy S7:Transfer was pretty seamless, but the reception on this phone is very poor:Phone has bad reception and drops call frequently:2016-07-15:Griffy421
Samsung Galaxy S7:New phone:It's an ok phone. Hard to type on.:2016-07-14:Move
Samsung Galaxy S7:Does not hold charge for a long time:I bought this 2 weeks ago.  Only I don't like is the short battery life:2016-07-14:Pepsi75
Samsung Galaxy S7:Transition difficult for me:"I don't know if it is ME or the phone, but things I learned to manage on my previous phone don't work the same way. For example, I used to be able to access ""voice mail"" by clicking on the icon; now, if it hasn't self-transcribed into a text message, I can't seem to access it.":2016-07-14:LibbyLoo
Samsung Galaxy S7:Too big, too complicated, to much $!!!:I've had it a week and it is too complicated and all the little icons representing different apps and options do not resemble in any way what they do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  So far hating the upgrade!:2016-07-14:NinD
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointed- Have had the phone for a week:Switched from 5 to 7.  Applications slightly different.  Battery is the best feature.  Honestly thinking about going back to 5:2016-07-14:jalexander1234567688
Samsung Galaxy S7:Switching from iphone to galaxy:I am adjusting to the different features from my old phone, some are better than others. I am finding some features I like of my old phone are still there but I just have to figure out how to use them.:2016-07-14:LaniNP
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsinh s7:Just bought the Samsung S 7, not all that impressed not much difference at all from the S 5:2016-07-14:Tara S
Samsung Galaxy S7:Slightly disappointed:Many of the apps had to be uninstalled & reinstalled I still don't have my ring tones or ring back tones Emails are difficult to delete:2016-07-14:7 needs time to get used
Samsung Galaxy S7:Sending Txt Pics:My last carrier wasn't the best for service but I could send multiple pics via txt at one time. With Verizon after visiting the store I have to send multiple txt when sending multiple pictures.:2016-07-14:Jt16
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the features but the battery dies half way through the day.:I love Samsung Galaxy. My last phone was an S5 and over 2yrs old and this battery doesn't last as long as that one. That's my biggest disappointment. The guy at the store told meveryone it had a 27hr battery life. Well, yesterday I took it off the charger at 7am and didn't touch it at work until around 1 and it was already at 35%.:2016-07-13:Ashley4891769
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone is ok:Phone is easy to use. Also sounds are good and loud. The only negative things is the service is awful. My s5 was so much better:2016-07-11:Brad123
Samsung Galaxy S7:LG V10:Phone is nice, but battery life is not great on it.:2016-07-11:sandiB33
Samsung Galaxy S7:Features are great, but some are hard to find/use.:I upgraded from a Galaxy S5 to this S7 and glad I did.  I am really enjoying it.  And, it takes awesome pictures.:2016-07-11:dragonlady93
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great camera, otherwise nothing special:I bought this phone because my LG g3 had a sim card reader issue they couldn't fix, I thought the phone would be a little more durable as it fell off my leg onto the floor and cracked the back glass on the phone, such a poor design, also you have to press much harder than any other phone I've had in the past to type, the fingerprint reader works great,  awesome camera, charges fast, otherwise all is the same old..  Cons- the glass rear cover is delicate , battery doesn't last as long as you would think, alarm clock is worthless, maybe after a few more months I will feel differently. Hope it lasts that long:2016-07-11:Suzrm142
Samsung Galaxy S7:New Phone:I'm starting to get used to the phone, however, I think it would be great to have the basic features in a little booklet that comes with the phone.  We all learn differently.:2016-07-10:Dorothy90
Samsung Galaxy S7:Features are great, signal strength is terrible:I upgraded from an S3.  The features on the S7 are great but the signal strength is terrible.  I had no problems with the S3 signal strength.:2016-07-10:vettman60
Samsung Galaxy S7:Really good, but not the greatest.:I got better phone call reception/performance in my home with my Galaxy S5. What did you do Samsung? Downgrade the antenna?:2016-07-09:dropcallbill
Samsung Galaxy S7:Functions better than previous phone. (Previous phone more than 5 years old.):I selected this model because of its resistance to water/moisture and the camera clarity.  It appears the screen's sensitivity increases when damp/wet because when my shirt becomes wet (sweat) it causes apps and functions to activate. The camera (photo & video) is excellent.:2016-07-09:NA123
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointing:I love Samsung. I have had S4 and S6 previously.   My S4 was probably my favorite phone ever, design and functionality. I have had the S7 for 2 weeks, and I really want to love it, but I don't.  It is sensitive, and has little fits. It goes to black screen, the volume is horrible, charge does not hold long, and it super delicate.  I have never scratched, much less cracked a screen with my other phones.  I dropped this one in her case, on a wood floor, and the bottom spiderwebbed. I had it 4 days.  I dropped the others without cases, on pavement with no problems, not even a scratch.  So, besides the fact my phone seems to be a 15 year old teenage girl, it also is as delicate.:2016-07-08:Crazy kids
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great camera comma terrible battery life!!:My Samsung Galaxy S7 has a great camera. It takes wonderful videos. The only problem is that the battery life only lasts me three quarters of a day. I barely even use it, and it dies so fast.:2016-07-08:Lexie S
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nothing special:Just ok. I thought battery would be better. Nothing special about design, feels too same as Samsung 6.:2016-07-07:Nicoleraemt
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone:Phone is good but besides being waterproof i cant tell that much difference from my samsung galaxy 6.:2016-07-07:Deltadawn8043
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery life is terrible!:The battery won't even last a day with moderate usage:2016-07-07:Mark555
Samsung Galaxy S7:Tired of advertisements popping up, didn't have that with my other phone:Having trouble setting up Facebook, won't recognize my information there, constantly getting virus clean-up messages and messages wanting me to subscribe to things.  Can't just open my phone and make a phone call without cancelling seven different windows.:2016-07-07:nenejohn
Samsung Galaxy S7:Kind of difficult to use:"I have never had a smart phone so this is a big learning challenge for me. I find the texting difficult to use. (EX: type a letter another letter appears) Sending messages took a little bit to figure out. All the similar apps are confusing as can be. Can not access my yahoo mail. Has something to do with my yahoo security protocols. It tells me to use a different address but when I try to download it it tells me it is already on the phone but I cant find the programs or apps. Granted I am not use to a smart phone so I will just keep earning about it. Would be easier if there was a manual for it. My daughter picked it up right away and has been able to show me how to do stuff.":2016-07-05:hate this stuff
Samsung Galaxy S7:Eh:I bought this about a week ago and it didnt comw with a booklet just a website i could go to which was very confussing and not helpful at all:2016-07-05:Me102
Samsung Galaxy S7:Keep smilin:I bought this 2 weeks ago and keyboard features are annoying.:2016-07-05:Jack7395
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nothing changed:I'm not sure I want to stay with the Samsung 7s:2016-07-05:A Carmichael
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7 is ok:I do not see anything special on here. I like the note edge better. Larger screen and easier to use.:2016-07-05:JennMafDog
Samsung Galaxy S7:not amused..:its ok, but wishing I had gone with something else. they made everything more difficult for no reason.. the simple send text to group now requires you to type in the group name.. then click each member in the group.. really wastes time.. the auto car mode is annoying and cant be shut off even when you turn it off.. you have to do it again every time.. pics are great.. but so large you cant send but one at a time.. and of course they made it larger, so now its like answering a flip flop to your ear.... they are lucky they got three stars.:2016-07-05:Toddk371
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone is great but too costly:Love my Samsung. Any Android is always better than Apple products. I hate that Verizon forces you to buy the phone at the full price and in monthly installments. There's no deals/discounts anymore on these extremely overpriced phones.:2016-07-05:zillernesss1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Ok:Lots of new features:2016-07-04:June bug
Samsung Galaxy S7:Broke easily:Bought Galaxy 7  a week ago. Dropped and it cracked. Prior samsung 5 was dropped same way, many times, Never cracked.:2016-07-04:Ashane
Samsung Galaxy S7:Still have trouble getting used to it:Ive only had this for a week and am quite frustrated. I can't add my own ring tones even though I'm following the Google advice. I've purchased two songs and neither have downloaded. Even though I made a commitment to turn in my old phone imessage thinking of spending the money and sending this back and keeping my iPhone.:2016-07-03:Linnie196667
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not what I expected:I had to purchase updated phone for work purposes and was advised to go Android since all other devices are Android.  Was told the Galaxy S7 would suit me better than the Edge--I didn't need all the Edge features.  My local store walked me through the basics and transferred all my contacts as a courtesy.   So far the battery life is less than expected - automatic updates go through it quickly and require mid-day recharges unless you know to schedule them when at home.  Am not used to having to manually have to close each app upon exiting - other devices do that automatically.  If you don't close them they add to the battery drain.  Also lost 6 favorite contacts one night when phone was not in use - no clue why.  Have had to re-input contacts since new system sorted them differently than original device - again no clue why.  Have no major complaints beyond battery life and expect I will appreciate features once I become more familiar with them.  Would recommend to someone experienced on smartphones but to a novice only with training.:2016-07-02:Smartphone novice
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not sure how I feel about this right now:Not too bad, although the battery life is not very good:2016-07-02:mwright2742
Samsung Galaxy S7:Soooo glad it's waterproof:I got my phone Father's day weekend..the bill is really high but the phone is great...I wish I would of had something like this year's ago:2016-07-02:Mrs T
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's taking more time to learn than my Galaxy 5:It's taking more time to learn than my Galaxy 5:2016-07-01:BruceA822
Samsung Galaxy S7:"Not an Easy transition:( is hard yo use":"I bough this phone not long ago,and still not just to it!!! Sorry i like iphone more much better :(":2016-07-01:Gab8x
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love with some exception:Everything transferred from my Galaxy S5 but the S7 is not finding my contacts when making a hands free, bluetooth phone call.  This has to be fixed or I may be trading it back for reconnection to my S5.:2016-07-01:ElsieCork
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7:Swinched from iPhone 6 to s7 and wasn't impressed.:2016-07-01:Vsteeda50
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not a fan. I miss my S4Note!:I bought this because I was in need of a replacement when my s4Note was damaged. I would have chosen an s5Note but I was told I wouldn't be able to use my SD card. The s6Note will have all that I need, so I'm eagerly looking forward to its release. Why is this screen guard cracked in the upper right corner already? I haven't even dropped the phone! The battery life is NOT as impressive in duration as I thought, although it charges  faster. I do not like the limited volume. The location of the speaker makes it hard to hear the phone ring or audio play when the phone is face up on a flat surface. ...and why could I not choose a simple ring tone that actually sounds like a phone ring rather than an alarm tone or some music I may ignore? A few photos come out questionably blurred and retakes are always necessary in dim light indoors. I have not found the wow factor of this phone yet.  It seems basic. Not impressed.:2016-07-01:CJ Android over iPhone
Samsung Galaxy S7:Like the phone - frustrated that all my contacts did not transfer:I am missing lots of my contact cell numbers to text me. I am getting text messages, but not able to know who it is or am looking for someone's number and only have their email. FRUSTRATING!!!:2016-07-01:idontliketogivenames
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not as good as my old Motorola Droid Maxx:I've had it for a week. I reminds me of what would happen if iPhone and Android had a baby. I hated my iPhone 5s. The swipe keyboard is horrible, like the 5s. If you turn on the battery saver function, it still rips through the battery compared to my Maxx. Leave the battery saver off, and you will be charging it at lunch. This is just my first impression. It does have some nifty little functions to play around with, but nothing you can't just download an app and have the same nifty little function. I'm probably going to take it back and get the droid turbo 2.:2016-06-30:
Samsung Galaxy S7:Regretful:The fluidity of the operating system is not satisfying to me. Email push is slow and the messaging apps are not utilitarian. Simply put, Android is not a productive communication system. It is an alternative to the iPhone and that is it. My Blackberry was a productive communication device/system that was designed for phone/email/messaging. Android has more apps, but even with that, it isnt fluid and relies too much on wifi to be accomodating.:2016-06-30:Twiggster
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's ok.:The battery life is not all that great.:2016-06-30:Honk e kong
Samsung Galaxy S7:Its ok, but not what I expected.:Starts off good, but slows down with minimum usage.  I had an iPhone 5c with is the worst iPhone ever and got frustrated.  I should have went with the iPhone 6!!  Going back as soon as my contract is up!  iPhone is SO much user friendly, ESPECIALLY if your into music!!:2016-06-30:callmebiscuit
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not happy:Got this phone a couple weeks ago because the battery life on my old phone was not good.....I think the old phone may have had better battery life!  Really not happy/ I have closed everything out that I know and use the power save.:2016-06-29:dianeh49
Samsung Galaxy S7:Can't seem to transfer all the features from my old phone:Verizon network over rated.:2016-06-29:kei63
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not an easy transition from Note 2 to Samsung Galaxy 7; and no booklet with instructions included.:I bought this phone approximately 7 days ago.  This has not been an easy transition from a Note 2 to a Galaxy 7.  There was not instruction booklet include to help me understand the phone.  The keys on the keypad is too small for me to type on.:2016-06-28:bettie21
Samsung Galaxy S7:"Its an ""ok"" phone":I had the s5 before my s7, the phone is ok with a few more features then before. I was used to the bigger screen on my s5. I like that it fits in one hand, but i might have to bring it back for the note 5 for the bigger screen.:2016-06-28:Busa1340
Samsung Galaxy S7:Meh, it's ok:Lots of ads and pop ups, settings constantly getting changed.:2016-06-28:Jlm45655
Samsung Galaxy S7:Can't do some things.:I can't download or install some applications.  Not too happy.:2016-06-28:Jake the snake
Samsung Galaxy S7:Call and Text annoucing:Phone is OK,  but it doesn't have phone a text message announcement.  Miss that feature I had on my LG G2 phone.:2016-06-28:Franmatt
Samsung Galaxy S7:Bought 1 week ago...still figuring it out:The phone is GREAT but I still need to find all the special the special features hidden inside!:2016-06-28:wild_Bill55
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nothing special.:Most tasks were easier on my iPhone 5. I wish I'd chose the IPhone6.:2016-06-28:hammer87b
Samsung Galaxy S7:Like phone but everyone else has iPhone and face time is a problem:"Good phone if everyone else had it but apple is what they want:(":2016-06-27:Bigdennyj75
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy 7:The battery dyes  fast:2016-06-27:Yolie4
Samsung Galaxy S7:Little clumsy:Not as good as the note:2016-06-27:Grantthomison
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7:Got this phone a week ago and do far it's been ok my biggest problem is that I can't seem to put a message tone to my text messages . But still figuring out the phone completely:2016-06-25:Scott31
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone:I would have given a 5 star were it not for being bombarded with 10 e-mails a day.:2016-06-24:NEVER MIND
Samsung Galaxy S7:Really great phone, but there needs to be a number on the phone icon showing number of missed calls or voice messages.:It really is the best phone ever, and I've had a few, but the phone app doesn't show how many total missed calls and voice messages I have. If the iPhone can do it, why can't the Samsung? Seems like a no-brainer to me.:2016-06-23:Paula N
Samsung Galaxy S7:Glitchy:"Good: Camera, Size, Features Bad: Glitchy, Freezes, Slow at times, Games lag and drop frames.  I am getting decent battery life. The device itself is nice and premium feeling. The software will freeze coming out of the lock screen or freeze at the lock screen. Sometimes it will lag just going in and out of the app drawer or even swiping through screens. Not overly thrilled about this purchase.":2016-06-23:JLDMKB
Samsung Galaxy S7:Some good, some not so good:I love the camera and its features. The battery drains quickly, which I wasn't expecting from a new phone. I am glad that I can add such a large storage card. It seems to move slowly which is disappointing.:2016-06-23:Rmeeks77
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone is okay.:When my husband and I call each other it sounds like we're talking through tin cans.  The messaging system is annoying.:2016-06-22:Geminlisa
Samsung Galaxy S7:17049295043:Customer service was excellent, I had just dropped in to see the latest version of my phone. Good physical but trouble trying to get some apps to work as easy as before.:2016-06-21:Freeeagle458
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung 7:I bought the phone about 2 weeks ago and I'm getting used to it. The battery diminishes pretty quickly which I thought it was better. It does take decent photos.  My calendar did not transfer from my old phone so that has been a challenge to recreate on my new phone.:2016-06-21:LynnaKmeow
Samsung Galaxy S7:the screen is nice:i bought the last week because I thought i lost my old phone, but I was going to up grade this week any way.:2016-06-20:frankb18
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good verizon service ,poor battery keep s6 is better:Drain too fast the battery,:2016-06-20:Sanchezosornio
Samsung Galaxy S7:decent phone:good screen.  price way too much.  poor reception.  Side by side with my old S3 and the older technology gets 4 bars and new phone gets 1.:2016-06-20:justaregularjoe
Samsung Galaxy S7:So far so good:I upgraded to s7 after my previous one gave. I wished there was a manual that came with it cuz still struggling with going around it.:2016-06-20:Tis7
Samsung Galaxy S7:Several issues already:I bought these phones and tablets about 2 weeks ago.  My s7 is glitch ingredients a bit, the speaker makes music and callers sound different.  My daughters tablet wouldn't charge past 1%.:2016-06-19:Trishacastro
Samsung Galaxy S7:Pretty phone but compared to my turbo it ain't got the power:"I bought this phone a few weeks ago now. I still wonder why I didn't take it back and get a Motorola droid TURBO.   I used to really like Samsung but after 4 years with Motorola phones, lastly the Maxx and turbo models ""which I still have and use in my work"",  I find my Motorola is easier to use, probably because I'm used to it. Then also the battery life in my Motorola is longer, it charges faster, and is not so slippery to hold on to, and gets better service.  I'd say the Motorola turbo is more of a working man's phone than the Galaxy s7.":2016-06-19:Nick name here
Samsung Galaxy S7:Transitioned from iPhone5c  to Galaxy 7S, still confusing.:I bought this Galxy7S about  month ago, and I'm still getting to know it, I had an iPhone, and they sure are different, but I like a lot of the features on the 7S, but I miss a few from my old phone, But I am happy with the Galaxy 7S.:2016-06-18:Pithy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Neat phone:Love the phone, I miss the screen size, stylus and brightness of Note 3.   The Samsung to Samsung transfer did not work as indicated, everything did not transfer!:2016-06-18:Stacey1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Had no problems with phone:Had phone two weeks and now sometimes it rings and sometimes it doesn't when I am getting a call or message. I don't know if I would recommend it yet:2016-06-17:Mike365
Samsung Galaxy S7:It is ok, but a few problems:I have experienced the following problems that I have not had with my S3, the phone I previously had to this one.  I have had dropped calls in locations that I never had problems before calling the same people I talked with from the same location.  Also, I had a bit of a problem syncing the phone with Sync, but finally got it done.  I have had many occasions where, while driving, the phone loses its connection with SYNC. Other than those issues I find the phone fast, pictures good and the display is outstanding.:2016-06-17:BobInTucson
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not Much Improvement Over S5:"Last week I upgraded my phone from the Galaxy S5 to the new S7.  I'm not seeing much improvement, though I have to say that made transition very easy.  The so-called ""fast charger"" that's supposed to take 30 minutes takes over an hour.  One reason I wanted to upgrade was the battery on my S5 was fading.  I still have to charge every day with the new phone.  No improvement, so there was no real reason to upgrade.":2016-06-17:barbarav
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's ok:Pretty  happy with it.:2016-06-16:Miss cheese
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's nice:It keeps acting up and it keeps dropping calls.:2016-06-16:RoperChick
Samsung Galaxy S7:New phone:i got my new phone less than a month ago and still learning how to use it:2016-06-16:rgmaxey
Samsung Galaxy S7:OK:devise tends to break up during phone calls and will lose connection, very frustrating:2016-06-16:none of your business
Samsung Galaxy S7:moderate,:Moderate phone, fewer apps, and many apps don't want, but cannot get rid of. should be easy to get rid of apps I donot want.:2016-06-15:khan11
Samsung Galaxy S7:Win Some, Lose Some:I wanted to upgrade mainly to replace my HTC One M8 running Windows 8.1 (since it won't upgrade to 10) for the Droid OS, and opted for this over the new HTC flagship. I did a ton of research. I love that it's IP68 rating, the camera and display are awesome. I use it in place of an older, small laptop to cruise Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter because it is quick.   With that being said, the battery life is underwhelming. I end up placing it on the charger everyday. If it's a day where I listen to music via my Bluetooth headphones, texting more than usual or have a couple of calls I'll go to bed with the battery at 35% of its capacity; I eek out 55% if I've just used it for music in the car and light usage during the day. The last thing of note, I'm not an audiophile... I do notice my old phone played music at higher quality.  There are other little things that irk me a little bit, but I don't know if it's an OS, App, or phone issue.:2016-06-13:Phieding
Samsung Galaxy S7:Some cool features, but just okay.:I've had the phone for almost a month. I like the IP68 waterproof rating and the LED screen is great. I'm not impressed by some of the basic functions of the software. The phone section could be a more user friendly. When I start spelling a contact name to call, it only suggests favorites or by alphabetical order. It doesn't suggest contacts that I call frequently. In the recent calls, I have select the # that I recently called and then select to call it. Why can't there be a call button next to the # under the recent calls? Why doesn't the Verizon S7 have FM radio capability? I thought the reception would be better than my LG G3, but it isn't. The only aspect of reception that is better, is that I can hold my S7 between my ear and shoulder and not lose signal like my G# would. Overall, the LG  software seemed more user friendly and stable. Speaker being located on the bottom makes the phone hard to hear when it's laying down.:2016-06-13:dannyw
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone - not so nice transfer of data:Like the phone but not the way contacts transfer over and no text messages transferred over.:2016-06-13:Susans phone
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not much different from the note 4 except it has no IR blaster.:I'm not too happy that I loose my IR blaster and I still can't find my voice to text option for my keyboard.  The phone is fast, but Imy not sure it was worth starting payments over again over my last phone.:2016-06-13:Ryan80516
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easier than an iPhone:I've had this phone for two weeks and it's easy to use and simple. That's why I like it.:2016-06-13:KarKar34
Samsung Galaxy S7:New phone:Just upgraded from S5 to S7. Almost the exact same phone, just upgraded. Easy transition.:2016-06-11:Javyespitia333
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's OK:Wish I would have stayed with my note 4.  I may return this as its not really what I was looking for.:2016-06-11:AK9TX
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone overheats and shutsdown:From the first day the phone would over heat and shut down for hours at a time. It was replaced today.:2016-06-10:MarieS
Samsung Galaxy S7:Dissappointed:For the money it doesn't have a lot of the optionsame the s5 I had did and it seems less user friendly:2016-06-09:Auquamarie
Samsung Galaxy S7:Terrible Battery Life:Some nice features on the phone itself, but very disappointing battery life on my device. I use it for roughly a TOTAL of 20 minutes each day while at work and by the time I get home it's at 20% IF I'M LUCKY. It seems that no amount of closing tasks helps.:2016-06-09:JLO2002
Samsung Galaxy S7:Somewhat disappointed:I bought this last week and am disappointed in some of the features.   I need to charge it too often.  On most of my emails I only received the subject and not the body of the email,  doesn't download emails as they come in.  Plan to go back to Verizon store.   The salespeople are really helpful:2016-06-09:Lainiemags
Samsung Galaxy S7:Next time I'll go back to my I-phone:Have had trouble bringing up Pandora, and syncing the phone to other blue-tooth equip. The Siri equivalent takes about 10 seconds to answer... so I don't even use it.Otherwise, it's a nice phone:2016-06-08:Bikerider54
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's ok:I have a lot of problems when making calls. Sometimes it tries to ring and hangs up immediately. Sometimes the people on the other end can't hear me. I have a hard time hearing them. Just a pain when I use that feature the most!:2016-06-07:Jenn7682
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy s7:I upgraded from the 5s to the 7s and somethings are better, but the wifi signal is not as good as the 5s. With my 5s I could walk to the mailbox and the wifi still works, with the 7s walking to the same distance the wifi would not pick up.:2016-06-07:williams516
Samsung Galaxy S7:Still can't decide:I want to like this phone a lot more than I do. I love the new features, and I'm so happy that Samsung went back to SD storage after the S6 - not allowing SD was enough to make me move away from the Galaxy. But the phone itself doesn't seem to be that much better than the S5 I had before. I almost wish I'd just gotten another S5. It restarts itself in the middle of navigating me (has happened twice in the two weeks I've had the phone), which leaves me lost in traffic - not good when you're driving in a very large city. The fingerprint unlock feature is great, but you have to put your finger on at relatively the same angle every time or it won't work, so be aware of that. And if it restarts, you have to use the pin the first time before you can use fingerprints to unlock. The only reason I upgraded was that my S5 was 2 years old and the battery no longer lasted, but now I miss it. It's a good phone, but I don't think it's much more special. I guess the water resistant thing is nice, but I'm not the type to expose my phone to that much water anyways.:2016-06-07:fishyface
Samsung Galaxy S7:Bigger screen:Faster better photo quality.:2016-06-07:Jobro
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone, terrible battery life:I've had the phone for a couple weeks now and generally like the phone but the battery life is just awful. I unplug in the morning and before lunch it's down in the 40% range, and that's with no apps running, screen brightness turned down, etc. Super frustrated with that. It does charge fast but if I can't get through the day without my phone dying even when I'm barely using it, it's not a good situation. I don't really want to carry my charger around everywhere I go.:2016-06-06:DaveTheSmith
Samsung Galaxy S7:So so:Not as impressed as I should be. Traded in my S5 for the S7 & the battery life has been unimpressive. I was told I needed to turn off the location services for better battery life. I didn't have to do that on my S5. So far I haven't found anything about the S7 that has impressed me.:2016-06-06:Melnoel
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7:So far not my favorite:2016-06-06:Purplecat611
Samsung Galaxy S7:I like that I have storage and battery life but why no talk to text:I wish updates didn't outdated your old phone but since it does this one's fine:2016-06-06:Paipai
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features:Really good phone easy to use:2016-06-05:Sweet 28
Samsung Galaxy S7:Lots of features but seeing that this is my first smart phone, it's difficult.:I've only had a smart phone for a week and this one seems to be a little hard to learn but I'm working on it. May take me a year to learn most of the features. It does have many lessons to learn. So far I like it.:2016-06-05:al44bikes
Samsung Galaxy S7:OK not as good as my previous Note 4:I bought this phone about a week ago and already notice that the battery life is not that great. I get about 10 hours use out of the battery using the phone normally. Also, the phone does not seem as fast as my previous Note 4 was.:2016-06-05:jcs27516
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone functions:Love the phone but hate the fact it always disconnects from my Internet. Galaxy S3 I never had issues.:2016-06-05:Michaelshain
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nothing special:"There is no special features that I particularly like. I do like the split screen feature, but other phones have this. WARNING: Software is not compatible with Windows 10. Can not connect and upload pictures/videos to Win 10 computer. Very disappointing.":2016-06-05:mauiturlock
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice looking phone very fragile:I bought this phone a week ago and dropped once from maybe two feet and the screen broke:2016-06-05:jembe
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice, slim look but ...:I have had this a few weeks and am still learning it even though my other phone was a S5:2016-06-04:samsung girl
Samsung Galaxy S7:2532227802:Service stinks for data/Internet. Otherwise I love it.:2016-06-04:Shell379
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung 7 has Battery issues:After turning on the phone the battery immediately starts to Drain.  My Droid Max was 10 times better.  I love the fast processing of apps and services on the S7 but the Battery life is horrible.:2016-06-03:shorton2
Samsung Galaxy S7:functionality became slow quickly:I purchased this phone about 1 month ago and it's already slow. The on button only works at times. The center button never scans your fingerprint accurately on the first try. Once it does it takes a few seconds before the phone actually unlocks. It drags.:2016-06-03:J3ssica
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's ok:I've been having Bluetooth problems and service problem which I never had either the iphone:2016-06-03:Jencas28
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's OK not the best or worse:I always expect nothing but the best when buying the newest phone on the market the phone it's self is good how ever I feel like there are many security vonerablities a and even though it's Samsung equipment Verizon could do a better job at protecting it's users privacy:2016-06-03:Visual
Samsung Galaxy S7:My particular phone's battery life isn't that well:Battery  life is not the beSt it dies really fast:2016-06-02:ToddBenjamin
Samsung Galaxy S7:Ok so far:I bought this phone a week ago.  I like most of the adanced features, but a couple things don't need to be included, such as holding onto your call list when you go to send a picture.  That's one more step to maneuver through.:2016-06-02:Amchenry
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung 7 lots of good old programs left out/and or changed.:I am totally stressed out with this new phone because I am leaving the country in 3 days.  The representative took the easy way out and downloaded everything into the cloud and not onto my saved icons and places. I had to spend hours with Liz the tech rep. to help me get back to my Real Estate business. I am a Realtor not a telephone geek.  Thank God for Liz. My phone was always dying so Liz had to use a lot of tricks to get it all set up properly. Now I;m noticing that it is not charging and that I had some static last night on 2 calls.   I hope to get to the store ASAP to have Liz see whats going on with my brand new phone.:2016-06-02:helencando
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nothing Special:I thought I'd notice a huge difference between the S5 and the S7, but it really just seems the same to me. The battery life is not good either. I'm not impressed.:2016-06-02:parkerco27
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's good for pictures adn texting...:"I had an S4 for 3 years and it was better at everything except the camera than this S7. I can't use it to talk on the phone because it drops all of my calls :( The battery does not last longer than my S4. I miss that phone. Lesson learned. Oh but it's so pretty and shiny and gold. That's about it.":2016-06-02:jpmayo
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use:It is a good phone. Easy to use. Takes good pictures and the screen is clear. Camera is easy to use. Videos play well and games are clear when playing.:2016-06-02:kblightenup
Samsung Galaxy S7:I am enjoying  my new phone.:My only  true problem  is it's so fragile.  My daughters phone cracked right away the first time it fell. Very upsetting:2016-06-01:Taylorsaunt
Samsung Galaxy S7:Hard transition from flip phone to smart phone:Since we changed from a flip phone to the smart phone it's been an uphill learning curve and not one that has been easy.   Don't really understand all the apps and even how to answer the phone is difficult.   Other than the 2/3rds that we still need to work on to use the phone properly its a good phone.    It will probably take us a longer while since we are not tech savy people.:2016-05-31:Flip to smart
Samsung Galaxy S7:Fast phone, difficult to hold:The S7 is a gorgeous, fast phone. Its camera is phenomenal, the screen is bright and the battery life is fantastic. I appreciate features like double - tapping the home button for camera, but I dislike the always on display personally - - I find it distracting.   Having come from an LG G3, I find the phone difficult to use with one hand, since the buttons are located so far down on the device.  The phone constantly mutes itself in my pocket too, leading to missed calls and messages. I'm also surprised the screen scratches so easily; by the end of the first day with careful handling and before I could get a screen protector, the screen has received a couple scratches. Definitely get a screen protector on this device ASAP.:2016-05-31:restfulrabbit
Samsung Galaxy S7:Got a DUD....:Just purchased...in call speaker is giving me problems...crackling poor sound quality ...not happy going back...other then that it is great...had the s4 for 4 years.....:2016-05-31:Jweed14
Samsung Galaxy S7:Remembered why I moved away from Samsung:So I broke my Sony Xperia z3 and since it was xlose to end of my 2 year i went for a new phone. S7 looks gorgeous.  However, after I came home started actually using it, i remembered why I chose Sony last time. It gets hot. Less battery stamina (I am not doing anything crazy and have turned off battery suckered off). Also Sony 's UI/UX is much more friendly. For example when you go on your call list to return someone's call when you take on their number it does not dial, it shows you another screen where you need to click on dial or send a text. Imagine this while driving.  I also loved press and hold features of my previous phone. Now I understand why people say iPhone is more user friendly than Samsung. It's not Android it's Samsung.:2016-05-30:alik3954
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not an easy transition. I would rather have the 6s than the 7s:Not completely happy with it it's too difficult to do anything with:2016-05-30:Charlene54
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good, but not great:"Voice mail for example.....i don't want to listen to a few minutes of who it is from, how long, etc....I just want the message. And, for texting....why don't my ""favorites"" show up?":2016-05-30:cbutter
Samsung Galaxy S7:Still getting used to it:Screen protector does not fit properly:2016-05-29:Ian Mac
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7:I really like this phone.:2016-05-28:Lovdad73
Samsung Galaxy S7:Prefer my iphone 6:I have had it a week and to be honest I prefer my iphone 6 to this galaxy s7 except for the battery life. The iphone is much easier to navigate imo.:2016-05-28:Len54
Samsung Galaxy S7:Same As My S3:I like the phone and it's better than the alternatives but I have the same issues as with my S3. The surface, without a case (which I prefer), isn't tacky enough to have adequate control of it's buttons. When I pick the phone up for a call I often hit a button and sometimes even hang up on someone. I think the buttons need to be somehow recessed and accessible when intentionally pushed or moved somewhere else to avoid inadvertent pushing. Other than that, I love the phone. The screen is awesome. All the apps I copied over work better. I also have a Gear VR so I'm enjoying that.  All in all, apart from the control surfaces, the best phone out.:2016-05-28:Christian1225
Samsung Galaxy S7:Semi easy transition:I bought this expecting better but the battery life has been disappointing.:2016-05-27:dcrellim
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not really happy with so called improvements:I don't like everything about this phone S4 was better in my opinion. Maybe later I will delete a lot of the kink and like the S7.:2016-05-27:Robgen
Samsung Galaxy S7:Stay close to power:After using a Galaxy S3 for a year or so I find this device much faster, screen much clearer, but... all this is at the cost of battery power.  Not sure the phone would still be running at the end of the day even with only checking email and making a call or two.    Turning on the 'power saving mode' seems to turn off background data.  No email notifications, no streaming music.  Sure, this power saving can be set to automatically start at specific battery levels, but until then, the battery plummets.:2016-05-27:crg976
Samsung Galaxy S7:Having a difficult time adjusting to the new phone:My other phone died a sudden death and Verizon wasn't able to figure out what went wrong.  Ended up purchasing a new Samsung S7. I'm sure once I learn all the nuances it will be fine, but right now it's very frustrating.:2016-05-27:dreamweaver67
Samsung Galaxy S7:What's up with outlook:Phone is great for the most part. Great battery, response. But outlook does not sync to my calendar like on my s5. Why does the old phone work way better in this aspect?:2016-05-26:Anonymousdoesitmatter
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not impressed so far:"I have had the phone for less than two weeks and have some issues. First, I had problems with texting. I spent several hours on the phone with Verizon Wireless being switched from representative to representative.  I also had great difficulty enrolling on the web site. Both issues are resolved, but with great difficulty and frustration. I must say that the representatives were courteous and easy to understand!  I am also disappointed with the ""Fast Charging"" adapter. It takes two to three hours to charge! I was told by the store rep. it would charge as fast as 25 minutes!":2016-05-26:Billy Boy
Samsung Galaxy S7:ok phone:The phone is ok. It is not user friendly:2016-05-24:phone123456
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's not as great as it should be:I have been playing around with it sines I got it. I like it. I was expecting more. I like the removable storage. Everything works great. The problem I am having is my video chat does not work. I took it into Verizon and got it to work on the sales rep's phone. I can use it on anyone else phone. Not even other Verizon members. I know people who can video chat with there S7s. I do not know if it is the phone or the network, I feel this phone can do so much more. I shouldn't have to use another app to video chat. My next phone my not be a Samaung. I like my phone, but it could be why better. I was hoping to be better then the iPhone.:2016-05-23:Dave Ssaints75
Samsung Galaxy S7:Too many unneeded apps:I had the Samsung S4 before, the phone material is lighter but messing the texture. Nice size screen and the camera takes wonderful pictures. Too many apps on the phone pre-installed. Taking up space otherwise would be usable.  Standard Android plug needed. Charges very fast.:2016-05-23:Hu Lee
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7:I am still learning  how to use features on the phone.:2016-05-23:redrider2424
Samsung Galaxy S7:Its good:Its pretty techy and cool.:2016-05-23:Puma1111bd
Samsung Galaxy S7:Bad Samsung, bad!:Faster than the galaxy s5 with less features. Good overall phone. Fast enough.. everything is good, just why do away with things like the IR blaster. I controlled all of my devices with that on the gs5 now I want to upgrade to the new galaxy but I find out gs7 doesn't have it!!!!!!! Glad to see they brought the SD card back though.... just really wish it still had the ir blaster. Have the s7 now but considering exchanging for the LG g5. Phone feels fragile with all the glass.:2016-05-22:Cjmcder
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Battery life. Terrible wifi.:I've been using it for about 2 months now. I have found that the battery life is great. With a full charge in the morning, I could get a full day of fair usage. I do not use the always on display to not waste any battery. I have found that the wifi is very unstable. I have noticed this problem in previous models as well. It is only with samsung devices. All other devices I have used don't have this issues so I know it is not my network. It also has issues on any other wifi I connect to.:2016-05-22:red3578
Samsung Galaxy S7:your average phone:the protective clear cover over the display makes it hard to press on side keyes-have to press very firm!  the phone serves it's purpose:2016-05-22:nadsni
Samsung Galaxy S7:Far From Perfect:I just finished my first week with Verizon, and this phone.  I loaded all my music on a 64 SD card and the music app couldn't find the files.  Numerous music player apps were downloaded, none of them could discover the MP3 files until I had tech support rescue the phone by transferring the files back and forth and then they were finally discoverable.  The voicemail doesn't always work.  I have been getting the notification telling me this, even though it's been set up and have received some messages.  I set the clock alarm 5 times for wakeup alerts.  It's worked only twice.   The phone ran hot for the first 2 days, even without the protective case.  The battery drained at an excessive rate, forcing me to use power saving settings which limit my functionality of the phone.    I received an alert informing me on the eve of the 2nd day that I had burned through the entire month's supply of shared data(6GB) in one day.  While it is roundly suspected that resulted from the hour long tech session, I am now constantly trying to find a Wifi signal, something that I never did before.  I used to use my previous phone, a Samsung Galaxy S4, liberally with a different provider.  I never went over 2 GB per month.  YouTube, Facebook, Wikipedia and random internet searches were all part of my daily usage.  This bizarre 6GB data burn and accelerated battery depletion has led me to avoid using my phone.  I get the feeling that there are apps or phone functions burning data and power without my knowledge.  To put my mind at ease, I've set up mobile data alerts that apparently keep my daily usage to a maximum so that I won't head towards a monthly overage.  This results in a late afternoon shutoff of my data, which I have to override to access the internet.  And I'm hardly using the phone!  I have scheduled a workshop with Verizon next week to address my concerns and questions.  Until then, I am not able to develop that love relationship one normally gets with their new phone, especially a technological wonder like a Samsung S7.  Right now it feels like a beast I need to tame.:2016-05-22:Minstrel
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice build, but junky speaker:Feels good in the hand, awesome screen, great camera, no probs with wifi or tethering.  But, talking to someone on speakerphone is horrid.  The speaker distorts and sounds harsh and shrill even at only 30% volume.  My 4 year old Nokia 920 sounds a lot better.:2016-05-22:2378wehoiu
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's good design, simple, basic.:I feel like it's already made all my choices for me. More developer options please. I want to feel like I made my device what it is. Like a private assistant.:2016-05-21:Brian Barnes
Samsung Galaxy S7:Okay Phone:For the most part this phone is almost identical to the S5 that I had prior. However, this phone keeps freezing on me & everytime I try to open my gallery an error message pops up saying that the gallery has stopped.:2016-05-20:Kie8
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7 Galaxy:Month 1 not very happy features S5 had that I liked the S7 does not have. I can't use the voice text or I don't know how and on home screen it doesn't show rain drops of lightening.:2016-05-19:Lmoseley
Samsung Galaxy S7:The guy was nice at the store:I bought it 2weeks ago.still learnings.:2016-05-18:Pam Comstock
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone with not so great changes:The S7 is a great phone like my old S6 but the S7 does not allow you to add your on tone/sound for text or email notifications. I don't like having the same sound everyone else has. For years with Iphones and androids I had a unique sound. How do you say its a better phone when you take away instead of adding. Another issue I have is I can no longer swipe across to delete my business email; google you still can.  I now need to tab the menu go to edit and then tab delete. WHY more steps why not swipe delete like on gmail.:2016-05-18:chasejune11
Samsung Galaxy S7:Poor battery life:Love the features of the phone, and transition from my old phone was super easy.  However, it is a good thing the phone comes with a fast charger as the batter life is poor.  Halfway through my day I am constantly at 50% or less.  I expected and NEED my phone to be able to go at least 16 hours without needing a charge.  Very frustrating!:2016-05-18:dsmoske13
Samsung Galaxy S7:The picture quality is amazing:Still getting used to change, battery life could be better.:2016-05-17:Mayri81
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not really to different then the one I had.:I like the screen but not really seen much difference yet from the Samsung I had.:2016-05-17:Georgia1231
Samsung Galaxy S7:Needs Improvements:I feel like they are making the Galaxy series more complicated, and cheaper material design. Nothing new in the pros of the Galaxy series, but not having a removable battery is a major con. Also, very difficult to add/remove sd memory card if you were to lose the small tool they give you. The screen design is much more fragile than it should be for the cost of the phone. The phone even has a naturally heavier feel than most. On the internal workings of the phone, it works great like the previous Galaxy phones. It's the exterior,and lack thereof that is a let down.:2016-05-16:dNos31
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone but battery:I've had my S7 for 3 months and I like the features. I've been android user for many years. I like the look and feel of the phone. I'm maybe an average user or maybe a little less and the battery can be drained by about 4 or 5 pm. I expected to be able to go a full day on a charge but not the case. Even with all the battery saving modes, it still can't make it much past around 5. Good phone, wish had better battery life.:2016-05-16:Refj4444
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not as expected, but I love the features:I was thinking this phone was durable like my S5, but it's not. The phone is very fragile like an IPhone. If you don't have a case or screen protector your phone is as good as gone if it drops. Minus that I love the feauters of the new phone.:2016-05-16:HuffyB
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features but battery life is no good:I have had it almost a week and the battery life is not good at all. I do like some of the features though.:2016-05-14:Mandak35010
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7:It get extremely hot.:2016-05-14:Brenda t
Samsung Galaxy S7:Had a basic phone....upgraded to the 7:Still learning, but I like it so far. Must admit it seems smarter than I am at times!:2016-05-11:MommaDebi
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's all about the battery people:This is a great phone. Awesome camera. Just about everything perfect.... except the battery that dies much earlier than advertised under normal use. For example mine lasted about 4 hours shooting regular pics/vids and chatting on fbk messanger. Not uploading or anything - just shooting pics then I'm down below 40% and dropping quickly. I'm sure there's some third-party apps to stretch the battery but you really shouldn't have to do that for such an expensive phone. The edges's battery is much bigger - if you're considering an S7 go for that one....:2016-05-08:
Samsung Galaxy S7:Windows it is not.:My wife and I moved to an Android phone for the first time because Verizon stopped supporting the Nokia line of Windows phones and no other network could support us as well. The Android interface is inferior in most ways to Windows. Specially on the Galaxy S7, it is a nice looking phone, very light and easy to handle. It has a bigger battery that is rated better than the one we had in our Lumia Icon. The performance of this bigger battery is pathetic and needs to be charged daily. We have taken numerous configuration measures, including turning off the always on screen which is a big battery drain. All in all, we are pretty disappointed in the move to Android and specifically to the Galaxy S7.:2016-05-07:Mark310
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not great so far:I've had this phone about a week and every time I pick it up to use it it won't turn on, I have to wait 2-5 minutes to even get the phone to come on. It is not the best phone ive had:2016-05-07:MikeACook
Samsung Galaxy S7:Lots of features but not as clear cut on how to use things like an iphone:Just got this the other day. I like the screen clarity, camera, and available apps but didn't like how fast the battery drained and my service bars was only at 1 or 2 wherever I went. With my iphone I had 3,4, or 5 bars. Didn't lose any calls but makes me wonder. I also noticed that my phone got very warm with the little amount I used it.:2016-05-06:snoophage
Samsung Galaxy S7:I like it BUT....:I've loved all of my Samsung phones (which have been many over the years). This one is also a great phone except the fact that when I use the swyping feature to spell it comes up with the most off the wall words and aren't even close to what I was trying to type. My Note 3 was even better and this is supposed to be the newest and best. I just think that for the price that is something that should be much better. If I didn't use that feature often it wouldn't be so aggravating but since I mostly text it's a big deal. I've tried changing all kinds of settings and still nothing has made a difference. I've never had this problem with any other phone and was doing the exact same thing I'm doing now.:2016-05-05:RachelB
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung - Galaxy S7:"This is my first smart phone and I'm having trouble figuring out some of the options. Everyday something comes up that I can't figure out. Just yesterday I received a phone call from our local hospital confirming an appointment and the only options that came up were to either ""ignore the Call"" ""I'm busy, call back later"" ""Driving right now, can't answer the phone"" . There was not an option that I could find to just answer the phone. I knew who was calling so I called them back to find out why the hospital was calling me. Also, I did not receive a users manual for this phone.":2016-05-05:Bubba27
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use:I am satisfied with the use of the phone. One thing that is a disadvantage is the battery life. I have to charge my phone 1-2 times a day.:2016-05-02:bootsy1121
Samsung Galaxy S7:Uhhh, not that impressed for all the hoopla, but it works just fine and gets the job done.:"Got a great upgrade value and trade in credit on my antique S4 at the Verizon Store. Battery life is the same as my S4, but it is adequate. There are some features that are very good, but the calendar application is crashing and the phone is only 1 week old :^/ Otherwise, it is okay.":2016-05-02:H from Tustin
Samsung Galaxy S7:More work to maintain than a computer!:My third Samsung Galaxy S? device. I had the S2 & S4 before switching to the Iphone world. Everyday THE S7 battery life is down 20% by 9AM and I've barely use it. MAKES you set or enable certain settings or it will keep chiming at you. Requires 5 buttons to be pressed to delete text messages. Sending video & pictures in messages is a little on the kludge side. Always have to turn off certain settings or notifications again after you restart the phone - it restarts or re-enables those settings you've previously disabled or turned off. Not an easy phone to understand on how to disabled the button on the lower front of the phone. In my pocket the button always bumps my leg and open many programs because it bumps my leg. Then I feel the heat from the phone because all the programs are open. After using three versions of Iphones, this is WAY TOO much maintenance. Sure, many people say bad things about iphones but they are WAY easier to use. I've worked in IT all my adult life.:2016-05-02:Keyaki
Samsung Galaxy S7:Poor sound quality using AUX cable in the car:Yes, the screen has more resolution. I found the texting options confusing, and was getting duplicate texts when I selected Text+, so I went back to the generic text mode with no features. Then when I connected the the phone using an aux cable to the earphone jack all I got was static in my car speakers. There was a setting I changed which improved it - but only when music is playing. Between songs, I get static. My S4 was way better in terms of this, but slower of course in everything.  It's a good phone, but maybe I'm doing something wrong- the AUX sound is terrible. Bluetooth works fine for transmitting my music to the MiniJambox. SO I'm using my old phone in the car as a music player. No Pandora possible though.  Thanks for listening.:2016-05-02:Mike247
Samsung Galaxy S7:50%:Just received last week, and I love mine. Only problem we had was I ordered one for me and one for hubby. His screen went black and unresponsive within 24 hours. The replacement was supposed to be here yesterday (Saturday), but didn't get here on time so he has been without a phone for 5 days. If his had worked as well as mine I would have given 5 stars:2016-05-01:Itsagamble
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good smart device with lots of features but the phone reception is terrible:I upgraded from the HTC M8, and this phone loads apps quicker and has a better camera, but the telephone reception is terrible and the battery drains very quickly:2016-04-30:drkoolsalb
Samsung Galaxy S7:Previous S4 user:This phone is pretty and camera pics are awesome. However, the voice and volume could use some improvement. The s4 had a volume plus feature which was awesome when someone was on speaker and the 57 always hangs up on people or they cant hear you:2016-04-28:Romero85
Samsung Galaxy S7:Liked my old phone better:I am never happy with planned obsolescence which seems to be the current trend. I don't use all the bells and whistles but just the basic use has a steep learning curve as nothing is similar to my old phone a Galaxy SIII. I'm not thrilled with the S7 but I imagine that any of the other phones would have come with the same drawbacks. For the price these phones cost it would be nice to actually get more than a couple of years on a phone before it starts glitching.:2016-04-27:jg123
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone but horrible battery life.:I have a larger memory on the new phone.:2016-04-25:Eckerd990
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition from previous phone but ...:Chose the GS7 based on expected better battery life, comparable features, and better camera. Battery life is okay but expected better. Still have to recharge about every 2 - 2 1/2 days. Power and volume buttons are poorly placed on the sides of the phone; they're where you usually grab the phone out of your pocket and hold it while talking w/o speaker on. Causes problems. Phone does not have the caller name audible announce feature my Razr Maxx did; would have expected it in a phone at this price point and current technology. Photo and video quality great but no zoom; another disappointing feature left out. Call quality is great; no problems with Bluetooth or WiFi, either setting up or using. SD card notification never goes away; clear it and it comes right back.:2016-04-24:sk8rsw
Samsung Galaxy S7:This phone has some glitches:I traded in my Droid Razor Maxx for this. Unfortunately, people I was talking to said my conversation was drifting in and out and they were not able to hear me. I could hear just fine and loved all the features. If people cannot hear me, that is a serious problem. Returned the phone and got the IPhone 6S. Very happy and everything works great. People can always hear me. Hopefully Samsung can get the glitches worked out.:2016-04-24:luv2teach
Samsung Galaxy S7:Camera the the best part of the phone.:Bought this camera the day it came out was very excited. Took it out on a road trip and discovered battery is horrible. My Samsung 5 was a much better phone indeed. Wish I would of gotten the droid turbo 2.:2016-04-24:Bright71
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery is garbage:For the price of this phone it should have came with a way better battery. Doesn't even last 12 hrs with minimal usage:2016-04-23:Lefty27212722
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's a Galaxy. Like every years.:There isn't anything I could write about this phone. It's a Galaxy same as years past plus the return of the SD card slot and water proofing. Main selling point for me was the water proofing. However this is just like any galaxy or android for that matter. Same OS you have used and will be slow in 6 months to a year due to use. Camera isn't amazing nor is the phone itself. Lackluster but usable. Good phone sure but its the same with most others.:2016-04-21:martingonzo112
Samsung Galaxy S7:No major changes since the S5:Im really disappointed with the battery life on this phone. I traded a Note 4 for the S7 & wish I had just kept the Note 4. I don't see anything special about the S7 . I had the S5 a few years ago & nothing has really changed. I wish I had just upgraded to a Note 5:2016-04-21:racecer42
Samsung Galaxy S7:Liked old OS better:I like my new S7, however I prefer the old operating system that my S5 had. With Marshmallow, they've added clicks to things deleting a text message string...it seems minor but it takes extra clicks now.  Also its disappointing that Verizon doesn't have a screen protector that fits edge-to-edge on the S7 (not the S7 Edge, but even the S7)  Other than that, I do like the phone and love the camera.:2016-04-20:Halobetta
Samsung Galaxy S7:Miss my S5:As other's have said it performs slightly better than old models but everything else is the same. The battery life is the same as what I was getting on my 2+ year old s5 so that's a little disappointing, I generally have to charge it by noon.:2016-04-19:Ryan D
Samsung Galaxy S7:Video app not as good as s5:Video app does not have auto play next and multiple video play during selection. This feature was the best feature of my Samsung galaxy S5.:2016-04-19:aru23
Samsung Galaxy S7:Transition from Galaxy S4 to S7:I have had my new for 2 weeks now and I have had a lot of trouble with battery life, connecting to Wifi and syncing of my fitbit. Although the battery charges extremely fast something is draining the battery on my phone significantly when I am not even using the phone. I will be reaching out to a Verizon store for assistance but this is very frustrating. As for the transition, the phone features are almost identical and why I purchased this phone. Hopefully I can get my issues resolved timely.:2016-04-19:steph74
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice camera, but not as durable as past models:We got these when they came out and within 6 weeks, both of us have scratches on the screens, and my husband's phone cracked from a very short fall in the car. We both had S5's before this and those were way more durable - never a scratch on them in 2 years. (actually, neither one of us has ever had a damaged phone in 15+ years, and we haven't used any special cases or anything) For the cost, it should be at least as durable as it's predecessor.:2016-04-18:bburkel
Samsung Galaxy S7:Expected it to be better:Battery life is horrible. Occasionally feels slow. I have to keep it on charger for most of the day to make it through. I wish I kept my 2 year old Windows phone.:2016-04-18:Roddick3
Samsung Galaxy S7:Underwhelmed:After all the reviews I was expecting a much better phone.:2016-04-18:ced3
Samsung Galaxy S7:Poor Battery Life:"Don't expect to go a full day of light/moderate use on one charge. Yes, it charges quickly, but I don't want to connect to a charger twice a day. If you use the battery saver it can go a full day, but it cuts back on the processing power. I bought it for the advertised ""24 hr of usage time"" and the ""4 GB of RAM"" but it seems like you have to choose one or the other. It's a good looking phone and has some cool features, but if you're not by a charger all day probably not the phone for you.":2016-04-18:justin3323
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice but small keyboard:My first smart phone Nice but very sensitive -switches screens with slightest movement ,very small keyboard -I need to use a stylist >good apps and works well:2016-04-17:hank70
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not truly happy with this version:Bought this Samsung about 1 month ago and it is not as easy to work with as my Samsung 3S. Crashes at work for no reason frequently. Cannot use my bluetooth with this phone...2010 car does not recognize this version of phone:2016-04-16:AZ Desert Rat
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone poor battery up life:The issues are more with the phone than Verizon. The person that helped me activate my phone was great. The problem I have is with the phone. It is supposed to have a great battery life but on a good day it about par with all the other phones.:2016-04-15:rg35
Samsung Galaxy S7:Critical Flaw:Overall this is a nice phone. Camera is fantastic, screen resolution is outstanding, and I'm able to delete or at least turn off many of the built-in apps that I don't use. However, there is one critical flaw; the antenna is significantly sub-par. This is the primary function of the phone, to make and receive phone calls. I have not changed providers, moved residences, changed jobs, or changed my daily commute to/from work. Yet the reception I receive from this phone, compared to my previous (LG-G2) phone, is way below impressive. I have significant issues with reception in my home office where I never did, and neither does my wife on her Iphone 5, before the Samsung S7. Also, the phone is super slippery for handling.:2016-04-15:NavyChef
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not cracked up to all the hype:Somewhat upset that I switched from my Galaxy 5 to the Galaxy 7. It was supposed to be faster and have all these extra features. The wi-fi doesn't work well at my home, when someone calls me in my office I can hear them but they can't hear me and the battery life is awful! I take it off the charger (it has been charging all night) and it already goes to 99%. By the end of the day, it goes all the way down to 19%, etc. My other phone didn't do anything of the above.:2016-04-15:Dar S
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features, very fast, reboots frequently.:All the features are great and it runs very fast. The issue is that it reboots frequently during the day and several programs won't open with Wi-Fi connected. It may be the apps, but my last phone did not have that issue.:2016-04-14:Koko123469
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy 7:It doesn't have the capability of the Samsung Galaxy 7:2016-04-13:poop
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great display/camera but.....:I'm hoping this review helps iPhone people looking to switch to the darkside. I've been one of those people for a few years now. I've got bored. Tried LG, MOTO X, HTC M8, BLACKBERRY, and now SAMSUNG S7. Gorgeous phone. Bad battery. Must be charged every single day and I'm not even on my phone all day. Too much of a hassle to find settings that should be simple to find. People like to say that iPhone people are dumb just because they want the user experience to be easy. Not true. If you don't mind a reboot every now and then or have to uninstall an app because it makes the phone run slow or drains battery, but have a more vivid display and quicker camera, android is for you. If you care about themes and fonts more than reliability with apps and Bluetooth, android is for you. You just want something that works and the battery is pretty darn good and it's very reliable and you never have to worry about it not working, I would go with an iPhone. Tip to iPhone people, research how to get the most out of the battery. If you do the right stuff, it's great. Both are great, just for different people.:2016-04-11:TeefMaker
Samsung Galaxy S7:So far - So good:I bought this phone only a week and half. Just today the screen went completely black but the phone itself was working still. The customer support walked me through a few reset features and was able to rebook my cell. I told him I was very concerned that such a new phone would do this and he assured me it would be fine. I am getting ready to ship our old phones back and it truly makes me nervous. Besides that the phone is a bit touchy on the various screens. Its very fast and love most of the new features. I also notice the battery does not last all day if I am on it playing a quick game or checking out FB.:2016-04-08:Susan S
Samsung Galaxy S7:New Samsung User 79:I needed to get a new phone only because my Casio phone would not hold battery charge. I heard a lot of good things about the Samsung brand which was another reason I waited for the S7. So I went into the store and purchased the phone. I noticed the second day that in was difficult for other to hear me and the wifi connection was poor. I took it back to the store within the 14 days and the tech had to do so things to my phone, while explaining why the manufacturer had certain features. A couple of days later I noticed my phone had a software update for all the issues I was having which means I was not the only consumer. But then the same day my phone just shut down and restarted, then it froze and I had to shut it down. Its a pretty phone but I do not think this phone software is all that.:2016-04-07:KiStew
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice but seems very fragile:Just got it a week ago and it already had a problem, it froze when I was using it, the screen went off and impossible to get it back on, I took it back and they made it work again, hopefully it won't happen again:2016-04-06:Tifenn
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery life, resolution:I go the phone 1 week ago. Glass back plate cracked within 2 days just from being in my pocket, originating where the light is on the back. Several applications do not work on the s7, not supported yet I would assume.:2016-04-05:n7hockey7
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not a fan:I bought this phone 12 days ago. Battery life does not last long, not user friendly. Uses a lot of data and has to search for internet signal. We have a booster at work and it still has to search for signal.:2016-04-05:Evie1994
Samsung Galaxy S7:I'm on my 2nd replacement.:I got a S7 the day it came out. I was excited because I was upgrading from a S3. Well, I'm now on my 3rd S3 because of all the glitches. When it doesn't have problems and is working properly, I love this phone. It doesn't have the voice commands that I was able to use with my S3, but other than that the features are great. The 1st S7 I had restarted itself one day and then the home button and others wouldn't work. The second, the touch screen went out and the 3rd, can't read the pictures it takes. It corrupts the data so nothing can read the pictures and I lose them. Also when I move things from the phone to the internal SD card, it erases it some times. If Samsung could or would fix these issues, the phone would be much better. Oh and the battery is poor as well. With me using the phone I have to plug it in about every hour and a half, if not sooner. But if I'm not doing anything and it's just sitting there. Then it will last all day.:2016-04-05:Rhae21
Samsung Galaxy S7:Like the phone but hate the wifi.:I like the phone but the wifi is horrible. It keeps dropping and causes the phone to hang. I have two S7s and they both have the same issue. Other wireless devices in my home don't have any issues with my wifi. I have read several blogs and a lot of people seem to have the same issues. Verizon sent down a patch but it didn't fix the issue at all. Hope they fix the wifi issues soon.:2016-04-05:WesLyles
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery life not as promised:Never had a problem with my iPhone 5 running out of battery by the end of the day. The S7 loses its charge very quickly despite promoting the phone as having increased battery life and some built-in battery-saving features. The display brightness changes to where you can't hardly see the screen when in auto. The lock button is in a bad position on the right side of the phone and is always getting pushed accidentally. Camera is ok but nothing special. I really like the expanded memory. All in all, the S7 fast and does the job.:2016-04-03:Beamer26
Samsung Galaxy S7:Bluetooth problem:Happy except it won't recognize, pair with or connect to Bluetooth devices. Disappointed.:2016-04-03:EKO1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung 7:The phone is great. However, I miss the larger screen of my Samsung Note 2:2016-04-03:Deb H
Samsung Galaxy S7:Dies faster than the S4 I just replaced that was 2 years old:Still getting used to it, I've had it about a week. Terrible battery life. Dies faster than the S4 I just replaced ironically because the battery life was starting to decrease...:2016-04-02:Unsatisfied450
Samsung Galaxy S7:GalaxyS7:Had phone for 3 weeks and have had restart the phone every other day. Today I had no service on my phone when I should have had 4G. It's okay, it works.:2016-04-02:Bobbybbaby76
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not happy with the battery of this phone.:This phone loses charge. I switched from an iphone to Samsung and am constantly having to charge this phone.:2016-04-01:megrmg
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good, but nothing special.:I love Samsung Galaxy phones, and I have had the S3, S4, S5 and now S7. One thing that could be viewed as good or bad, is they are all generally the same. Have mostly the same features, they just improve slightly in different areas each time. I love that this phone has wireless charging, I don't have to worry about my daughter ruining the charging port from yanking the phone around while it's attached to the charger. Also having a water proof phone is awesome, haven't had it encounter any water yet though. I did notice when I first was using the phone without a case, that it was sort of hot., which is strange. Also the Facebook app frequently has trouble on this phone but not my galaxy S5, it always says something like connecting to server, even when it has full bars of 4G. Also I use amazon prime music and unless I download the song to my phone, it usually won't stream an entire song without freezing multiple times. Instagram freezes often as well. None of these problems I have had on any of my other galaxy phones before with the same apps.:2016-04-01:AFCVC
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not sure if this was a good buy:I went from a Samsung Galaxy III to a 7. It still doesn't work in my home so there are a lot of drop spots One of the biggest disappointments is that my text messages are coming in as not the correct contact. It randomly selects another contact which is confusing on who is sending the text. The suggested emoji's don't come out correctly on other cell phones:2016-04-01:notsureifthisisworthit
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone, good features.:Bought this phone about 10 days ago. Nice phone with some good features and is easy to use. The fingerprint feature worked for the 1st few days. now it doesn't work at all. I don't believe my finger print has changed. Wiping the button clean does not help. Also the battery life is not as advertised, it is down to less than 75% in just about a 3 hour period of standby.:2016-03-31:Jisepe43
Samsung Galaxy S7:My iPhone 6 was faster:I had an iPhone 6 and I was bored with it so I went to the s7 so that I could personalize more and have fun with my phone. Well I have 12 mgb of storage available on this phone and just this morning it wouldn't open my messages, just be a black screen. Had to turn it off and back on and it lags sometimes. Win some lose some.:2016-03-31:Nattie459
Samsung Galaxy S7:From Droid Turbo to Galaxy s7:Very disappointed in battery life,, I have added sd card and the icon at top keeps popping back up.. camera takes good pictures.. big issue is you cant have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on at same time,I never had that problem with Turbo..Samsung needs to fix this problem.. wish I would not have got this phone..now im stuck with it:2016-03-30:tbul2015
Samsung Galaxy S7:App and Bluetooth issues:Upgraded from s5 to s7, the camera runs faster ando overall the phone is great. However, two keys issues as I live in the gym. I got the gear s2 and my Bluetooth headphones will not pair, but after getting a brand new pair of the same headphones they paired with the phone but still not the watch. Also all music apps I usehave been freezing or stopping after one song. I'm hoping this will be resolved once the apps catch up to the new OS..waiting for the Samsung rep to come help at my local store:2016-03-30:Jkay6
Samsung Galaxy S7:Maybe I'll return it...:"So I've had it a little over a week and on day 5 the screen went blank until I had Verizon support to help me restart it.. also won't play videos sometimes, people I'm on the phone with can't hear me at times(not reception) and now my messaging notification is not working none of the tones are. I'm not very happy with this phone at all. Charges super fast and the camera is great that's about it :(":2016-03-30:Shanleigh12
Samsung Galaxy S7:S6 to S7:Performance is very similar, very little difference. Works very well, but so did S6. Battery life is disappointing, no better than S6. Often won't last a full day. Auto-brightness seems much better than S6, works well even on bright days.:2016-03-30:Jonw9
Samsung Galaxy S7:Crashes for no reason:I like to listen to music (iHart) and the phone will just crash and restart...it's not hot and the memory is not overrun...Also, the screen seems responsive wile you are touching it, but if you lift your finger, good chance the next letter you hit will not register. It is like the screen falls into power save mode in a second..  Outside of that...works great.:2016-03-30:Patrick1983
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not anywhere near as good as I had hoped:I've had this phone for about two weeks now and admittedly it is my first Droid, but I am disappointed in the features that I lost in my Windows phone - the issues syncing calendars, incomplete transfer of contacts/data, no availability of incoming text announcement/reading. Love the display and the colors, but for the price, I would not go there again.:2016-03-30:Elliotte
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very disappointed in the battery:Not as much performance improvement over the S5 as I anticipated, but it is faster. The most glaring disappointment with the phone though is the exceptionally poor battery life.:2016-03-30:rj12345
Samsung Galaxy S7:Reception not the greatest:I really do like this phone. It's faster and holds way more data (once upgraded) then my old note 2. But I travel and I'm usually on the edge of the coverage area as is. This was RARELY a problem with my old note 2 but I experience a lot more dropped calls with the S7 then I ever did with my Note 2. So if you live and or work on the edge of service, this may not be the phone for you.:2016-03-30:Cavermark
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not Quite What I Thought It Would Be:Purchased 2 weeks ago, replaced the S4. Biggest glitch is with photo editing - it keeps freezing, on a frequent basis. While the photos are great, and I like the editing function - when it works. Phone doesn't come with Facebook app - what's up with that? Lastly, agree with the reviewer that wrote that the battery runs down quickly.:2016-03-30:PdxLiz
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the camera, miss the performance of my S5:Out of the box, the S7 can be buggy. The antenna is inferior to that of the S5. I have had more dropped calls with this phone in one week than 17 years of service, even with a new sim card added. The notifications that can't be turned off can be annoying. The bright spot of this phone is it's camera. The point and shoot feature is a refreshing addition to the Galaxy line. The pictures and screen are far superior than that of it's predecessors. .:2016-03-30:Classpro
Samsung Galaxy S7:bursting shot for the camera very annoying!!!:Sumsung should stop putting features you cannot get rid of, like the bursting shot, in the past the Flipboard and magazine! I am testing this phone and I will install another camera pp, I might have to return it!:2016-03-29:syl16
Samsung Galaxy S7:Unable to pair with my fitbit:The S7 has worked fine with the call notification, but I have not been able to pair it with the text message notification.:2016-03-29:calvin241
Samsung Galaxy S7:Basic and no remote:I hit this phone because I love Samsung products, especially the cameras. The camera works great, processor is fast, battery life lasts a long time but I can't hover view my emails, get a larger view of my pictures hovering my finger above it before I click on it anymore. There are a lot of features that were originally on the s4 and even with that, with the software updates, they were taken away to. The worst thing about this phone is that there is no IR sensor. NO TV REMOTE, but yet there's a heart rate sensor, a barometer and other useless junk that I'll never use. The IR sensor and other standard features are what kept me with Samsung instead of an IPhone:2016-03-29:Andrews48845
Samsung Galaxy S7:Problem with Iheart Radio:Phone restarts when listening to Iheart Radio, very annoying, I would have kept my S5 if it had not broken.:2016-03-29:vego31
Samsung Galaxy S7:Having some problems:I like the phone but sometimes I run into problems. Sometimes my words with friends app doesn't act properly, and sometimes the phone doesn't make a sound with a phone call or text:2016-03-29:dolphinsing4
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not bad, but not great:Better than my last phone (Droid Maxx), but nothing too special.:2016-03-29:jchuck19
Samsung Galaxy S7:Average phone don't like as much as my S5:Not happy with the bluetooth/wifi issues. Takes a long time to send emails.:2016-03-29:twalton
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nothing special...:Battery life is weak. My older Moto Turbo was just as good. Dont get me wrong, its nice, its just not what you would think of for a flagship phone.:2016-03-29:Jsklipfel
Samsung Galaxy S7:S4 to a S7:I upgraded from an S4 to the new S7. The camera is amazing and is my favorite feature. I kept reading reviews before buying and heard about the awesome battery but I haven't been too impressed with the lifespan. I have to turn off the power saving mode so my Pandora will play, which kills my battery. And i usually firget to turn it back on lol. Sometimes the person on the other line can't hear me well and my audio while listening to music crackles. Like any phone it has bugs and I'm sure Samsung is still working to make this phone the best there is. In the end, I'm happy with my upgrade and look forward to learning new tips and tricks.:2016-03-29:RissaRoo
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great but buggy:Great phone but when calling anytging that requires touch tone options it refuses to work right:2016-03-29:Joekaiktsian
Samsung Galaxy S7:meh.:"it has some quirks that take awhile to get used to + the screen is either overtly sensitive or non responsive. i give it a solid ""meh"".":2016-03-29:edwardsvillle
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone but....:I really liked the phone but while on some calls in different locations, like my office, at home, in the back area of a store or in my car I have been having issues with either the call dropping or the person can not always hear me or the opposite. So I took my first phone back to the store to have it replaced within the first two weeks of purchase, hoping it was just that device but it appears to be happening with my second device as well, is anyone else having that issue or know what I can do to keep that from happening thanks.:2016-03-27:loyal customer
Samsung Galaxy S7:Scratches easily! No good screen protectors to buy:"I bought the Samsung S7 for my son just a week ago and he babies his phone. According to all the videos on this phone, it can withstand knives and such. Well, that is SO NOT TRUE! He already has 4 small scratches on this phone's screen and on the back of phone! The screen protectors on Verizon and Amazon get horrible reviews! I will say, the performance is great and the screen is vibrant and beautiful. It's easy to navigate around. But, my son is upset about that scratches and is worried about carrying it around in his pocket until we can get some better protection for it. I can't give this a GREAT review because of all the advertising of how indestructible and tough this phone's screen is. Its a lie! However, I will recommend this product due to the software and all the things it can do. Just hold on to the phone carefully :-)":2016-03-18:rbd77004
Samsung Galaxy S7:Camera looks to be cracked.:"Everything seems great and I love my phone EXCEPT when the phone arrived it seams to have a hair-line crack in the lens of the main camera. :(":2016-03-16:RyWal
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not Impressed:I avoided the S7 edge because I don't like how it makes it difficult for screen protectors to fit well. And yet for some reason the S7 screen is still slightly curved making my screen protector edges stick up. I'm also not crazy about their decision to make the back glass as well. Just makes it more breakable. The S5 was much more rugged. Hardware looks impressive but a couple apps have crashed already and the touchscreen is occasionally unresponsive. The S5 was much more impressive when it came out:2016-03-15:Cocomilk
Samsung Galaxy S7:Multi phone user:So the first good thing about this phone is it's design. It is slim and sleek. It's shape is a brother/sister to the iPhone 6/6s. Very similar. However, it does have a slightly longer screen but not too much wider. All the little features are nice and what you come to expect of Samsung droid phones. I have noticed the backside heating up a bit more than I like after a short time of doing setup activities with the phone. Then again the iPhone 6s I have is just as bad with a heated up back. Such is life when the battery is so close to the backside. All in all a worthy phone for droid users and potential Apple users as well since the look and feel is about the same!:2016-03-14:RGZwan
Samsung Galaxy S7:Fragile:"It slide out of the box when I opened it all of 6"" onto the counter and the lens cracked.":2016-03-14:Rbh71
Samsung Galaxy S7:Wifi issues from the start:Hoping the wifi issues get resolved soon, my phone won't stay connected, Verizon said it is because not all apps are updated to work with the new marshmallow system. I am eating up my data because my phone locks up on anything I try to do when I try to connect to wifi.it won't stay connected. Otherwise the phone would be great.:2016-03-14:aswedler
Samsung Galaxy S7:"Good phone.......but:":I replaced my Razr Maxx with this phone. It's taking some getting used to for me, but at least I can call tech support when I have questions. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the battery life. I don't know if mine is defective, but I have to charge it every day. When I went to bed last night I had 90% power. When I woke up I had 80%, without using it at all. last night. I don't know if I got a defective battery or not. I guess I will be giving tech support another call today.:2016-03-14:Ckling
Samsung Galaxy S7:Looks nice works fast battery does not last long at all !:Love the look of the phone, and it is very fast but I've already had issues with it force closing my apps turning off by itself (it turned on by self as well after but very inconvenient) . I do love the samsung health app that was aleady installed on the phone. Battery life is not impressive at all dies very quickly and I really don't use it constantly or enough for it to reach that point so I'm disappointed .:2016-03-11:Rreed26
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very disappointed:"Not as great as I expected.  The phone Constantly freezes up, especially when viewing email, will not download entire message,  just the title, have to keep going out and retapping to get message.  Sometimes the message never does come up, just the title, very frustrating.   Too many steps to access voicemail, if you swipe the notification icon to access the voicemail, it will only take you to the ""premium voice access"", then you have to decline and start again from the number pad. Previous phone would go directly to voicemail,  just had to put in password,  not have to dial a number, then passcode to access mailbox.":2017-05-08:Toshafeline
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's ok:Not what I was expecting after the s6.... loved my s6. Was fast and easy to work with. The s7 sucks compared to my s6. I hate this phone. Completely. It lags way bad. The only good thing about it is the battery life seems to be better:2017-04-15:Karli312
Samsung Galaxy S7:SLLLLOOOOOWWWWWWWWWW:I love Samsung and that is why I always get it but this one has been really slow and laggy. I've had it for about a week and already it can't keep up with my typing and often freezes or won't even let me unlock my phone.:2017-04-11:Jess 123
Samsung Galaxy S7:nagging problem:"4 times each day i am alerted to ""new software update"". Verizon tech help wasnt able to direct me. Taking back to store to see if they can figure out how to stop this nagging problem.":2017-04-10:Mississippi Elijah
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointed after returning to Samsumg from Motorola:Completely disappointed with the functionality, battery and updates. I regret going back yet was so excited to.:2017-04-10:Juleschq
Samsung Galaxy S7:Confusing and odd:I wish I had bought an iphone.  This phone makes no sense in comparison.  My mistake.  Set up at the store doesn't work, can't get my email.  Confusing as to how to get apps on the screen.  I hate it.:2017-04-06:
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice features:Nice features on the phone, I am having poor quality of service and am hoping that doesn't last forever.  Could be the phone but right now when I make some calls the peros cannot understand what I am saying.  I then have to call back on my home phone and then works fine.:2017-04-03:fergy1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung 7:The battery life is terrible, it just closes my apps without any notice, it is not user friendly.  I will be going back to an Apple iphone, and may get a deal through Target or Walmart:2017-04-03:topanganewfi
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not Intuitive !:I have owned at least 3 other Samsung phones but this was not at all intuitive.  The email font is so small that even with glasses, I can barely read it.  It has icons that I don't want but can't delete & connecting to wifi outside of my own home was ridiculous!:2017-03-30:seceret1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Short battery life is a bummer.:I had a Samsung Galaxy phone and lost it recently.  Replaced it with the S7 version and am very disappointed in the battery life.  The phone holds a charge for 7 hours.  I've used the guide to deactivate battery draining apps running in the background, reduced my e-mail sync time and deactivated my location finder and still have battery issues.  I wanted to try the new Google phone, but the Verizon sales staff was so unhelpful I just ended up with this phone.:2017-03-27:Mlrack
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy 7:Phone gets hot, battery will not last 6 hours w/o recharge. All background applications off. Phone is also hard to hold without a protective case.:2017-03-27:jmccjr
Samsung Galaxy S7:Liked the Samsung S7 until the newest software update was installed:I find that I use the phone less frequently than the Samsung S5 due to the fact that I find the newest software update to be very user unfriendly. I purchased the phone on 3/18/2017 and liked how it looked and worked. When I went to the free Samsung class on 3/25, the instructor updated my software to the newest version. I'm frequently told by the experts at Best Buy that the newest software offers so much more. But, every user is not a sophisticated user who cares for or uses all the bells and whistles. I did return to the Best Buy store on 3/26 to see if I could go back to the software version originally on my phone but was told that was not possible. Too bad!:2017-03-27:MacF
Samsung Galaxy S7:Lousy!:Buttons are in terrible positions, no matter which hand I grab it with I end up pushing a button. Not easy to turn off alarms or answer phone calls:2017-03-27:Badcompany1212
Samsung Galaxy S7:too many issues:For almost a week I was unable to text anyone who was not a Verizon carrier. I am also still having issues of turning the volume up for notifications. My volume is set to the highest volume but I still do not receive sound with notifications.:2017-03-25:S7dud
Samsung Galaxy S7:Video attachments to text messages suck when sent or received:Attaching a video to a text message is automatically downsized and too grainy to be seen by recipient. Messenger+ is OK but iPhone still shows video grainy and video I received from iPhone was grainy and distorted. Verizon store tried to help buy didn't have a good solution.:2017-03-25:Befeher
Samsung Galaxy S7:It gets hot:I can not use my phone for much because it gets hot and shuts down.  I also cannot put a protective case on it as it gets to hot and shuts down. Can't watch videos or play games.  Probably going to return.:2017-03-23:Mys7islame
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not so great:Im doing the same things on my phone and most of the time it gets hot for no reason. Over heated 2x. All the phones i had before this Is the one that i dont like. The only thing i like is the camera.:2017-03-22:Mhy123
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery life sucks:The phone interface is great. I have serious issues with the battery life. I've had enough has the Samsung s3 s5 and now s7 and this battery has the shortest life. Also I've had it shut off twice while on speaker phone and using navigation.  It just restarts itself after making a loud noise. I would have expected returned it had it,not been for a restocking fee and being past the 3 day window. Now I'm stick for two years.:2017-03-21:Zbella9654
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not as good as advertised:I traded my Note 5 in for the S7 since they no longer make a note I'm very disappointed in the Phone features expecially the camera which is the main reason I bought this over the modem. To be totally honest it wasn't for the fact that I bought OtterBox cases Exedra I would have already went in and traded it however I'm out several dollars on the accessories so I feel I'm kind of stuck:2017-03-20:Mrscottyp FL
Samsung Galaxy S7:Trouble with both my phones:I just don't like the phone  ! It's not what they make it out to be ! Little letters so hit the wrong one all the time ! I just don't like it !:2017-03-18:Pockets61
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy s7:I am not sure about the phone. It seems to need to be charged alot and it gets hot when I charge it or use it. I guess if I could I would rather try a different  phone.:2017-03-13:Karlaf
Samsung Galaxy S7:Eats up data and battery:Sound quality is an improvement, but so many apps are embedded and everything gulps down battery and data. Constantly drops/switches networks.:2017-03-08:FrustratedPhone2017
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointment with Galaxy 7 and verizon customer service:The phone has been a nightmare. We have visited 3 Verizon Stores for help and called your tech line. We are beginning get some of the features we had on our Galaxy 5 - through trial and error and hit and miss info from your associates. One of your supervisors on the tech line indicated that we probably not have some of the features on the Galaxy 7 that we had on the 5! We expected more features, NOT LESS! I have dealt with cell phones from the early 90's (bag  phone) and never had this many problems. I am gradually getting some of the bugs worked out and the problem we had with my wife's phone required a factory reset, another nightmare.:2017-03-06:Ed King
Samsung Galaxy S7:I prefer my note 5:For some reason my older note 5 was much faster. This phone is slower. I also notice that it is not as sensitive to the touch as my note. I have to push keys a few times sometimes to get it to enter, and pulling down the notification bar takes a few tries everything. Not as happy:2017-03-04:Relativity
Samsung Galaxy S7:don't buy:I have never had a phone go through battery life the way this one does.  I make very few phone calls and do not play games on it.  I do have a few apps that I use when I am out shopping.  Other phones would last days on one charge.  This one I am lucky to make it through one day.  I also do not like the fact that I can not seem to set up the home screen with the apps I want.  There were already apps there and they will not go away.  Also  I keep getting Briefings alerts.  I get enough email and texts that I do not want unsolicited junk.  I wish I had never bought this phone.  My HTC Max One was way better.  Also the internet is so much smaller on this phone.  Do not like this phone at all.:2017-03-04:4phones2016
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not my favorite:The pictures are smaller, don't like that. Having trouble transferring my old ringtones and music to new phone:2017-02-27:Floridaman
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not a fan.:Do not like the lack of a menu button in the bottom right of the screen like the S4 has. Also there is way to much bloat ware on this phone I cannot r:2017-02-27:Daemos
Samsung Galaxy S7:Knew better than to buy a phone from a franchise store.:hard to review a device that took over a week to figure out how to answer a call.  Two weeks to set up voice mail.  Not happy that you can not delete Apps that you have no use for.:2017-02-27:Not your regular customer
Samsung Galaxy S7:marie3:no!  the screen protector cuts off the edges of the screen.  REDUCING THE SCREEN TO SMALLER.  SO THAT THE EDGES OF YOUR PAGE. CAN.NOT.BE.SEEN.:2017-02-27:marie3schmucker
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great when it works:I absolutely love Samsung products and I hate to say that this s7 is a lemon always freezes and locks up. I do YouTube part time and this phone hates it. But I will keep it until the s8 arrives and lose money to upgrade to that. I have had this phone for only 6 days but I came from att and had the same phone with no problems at all so I know it's just this phone.:2017-02-26:RicksMoto
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointed:"After reading reviews I decided to get the S7 rather than the HTC 10.  I had an HTC M1-9 and the screen was not very bright outside and the S7 with all the fancy colors was supposed ot be better - NOT.  Still very hard to read the screen in sunlight. Also (although this may be a ""user"" error), I cannot get one notification tone for text messages and a separate one for emails. On the plus side, I bought a Qi charger and that works really well.":2017-02-23:dontusenickname
Samsung Galaxy S7:Dont like it:The key pad is to hard to type. The prediction text i dislike.  ............................. .....................  .........:2017-02-22:Froghead
Samsung Galaxy S7:Ok phone s5 was just as good:I have forgotten how hard it is to change phones. Battery life no better than my s5. They did not transfer all my info from old to new. Lost all passwords and settings. Phone has key board lag and to many apps I do not want but can't remove.:2017-02-21:Gaf471
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy S7:My phone doesn't work with talking to people, so I took it in to get checked and thought it was fixed.  Went back home and there are times callers say I am fading out while talking to me and it's still going on.  Thought it was fixed.  Need to take back and get another phone, but too expensive as will be charged for restocking fee.:2017-02-19:Cindys phone
Samsung Galaxy S7:nope:I had a note before this phone.  It doesn't have the features that the note had.  It is also a pain to use.  Dont like it at all.  Wish I could switch to another phone.  locked for 2 years.  ugh:2017-02-17:jemkim
Samsung Galaxy S7:Terrible:The phone freezes all the time, the battery dosent last long at all,dosent even compare to the note 5 I had before.:2017-02-14:J2002
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone with excellent screen resolution & long battery life:I had to finally get a new phone and looked at the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge.  Chose S7 and am so glad.   Great screen resolution  and so easy to learn new navigation.  Highly  recommended.:2017-02-14:Happy in Washington
Samsung Galaxy S7:Review...:Screen keeps blacking out and exiting apps, etc.  Also phone case did not protect screen and now my brand new phone is shattered.:2017-02-12:JUSTICEFORSEBASTIAN
Samsung Galaxy S7:Mediocre device. Poor functionality and UX.:The functionality and UX is worse than the five year old phone I'm replacing. I will never get another Samsung. I've never had this level of buyer's remorse before. Everything from weird automatic emoji insertion, to obfuscated GPS toggles, to the limiting Samsung UI overlay, to poor sound quality when talking. I hate this phone and often want to just use my old one, which works better.:2017-02-10:jrdvp
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy 7:This phone doesn't function as well as my previous phone and I would not ever purchase another G7. I prefer my old LG:2017-02-09:ELGA
Samsung Galaxy S7:I'd rather have my S6:"The touchscreen is not nearly as sensitive as the S6, but I feel like the rest of the device & features is exactly the same. I don't understand the point of the ""upgrade"" & after the fact that I have to practically jam the keys on the screen, I'm perturbed that I even bothered to switch.":2017-02-07:rirobers
Samsung Galaxy S7:I liked my S5 better:This phone is not any faster than my S5, it has less features and I cannot send a MMS while on wifi. I am very disappointed that the IR blaster was removed, and not impressed at all with the speed. My S5 seems as fast if not faster than this phone. The battery life seems to be the same or less than my 2 year old, original battery in my S5.:2017-02-06:DUMOR
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very different from my Galaxy S5:Thumb Print doesn't work, I'd write more but I don't have anything positive to say about the S7!!!!!:2017-02-04:Unhappywith S7
Samsung Galaxy S7:Would not recommend:I  have only had this phone a week and prefer my old phone. The functionality and capabilities are not as good as the galaxy s6:2017-01-29:Hpeterson
Samsung Galaxy S7:Review tital:Moving up from a Samsung 'tab a' I find that adding a phone to the mix slow me down a lot. This devise is going to toke me a long time to master.:2017-01-29:JBGA
Samsung Galaxy S7:Cell phone:The phone is not user friendly and I had to spend about 3 hours with customer  support before I could receive a call.  My previous device was a Nokia not an Apple.:2017-01-27:fruitphone
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not a fan - at all:"I was sort of forced in to an early upgrade because Verizon did not want to do a sixth replacement on my Sony Xperia.  I really don't like this phone AT ALL.  It has fewer features that I used on the Sony, it has a horrible camera, I went from a 20 MP to a 10 MP that is grainy, the phone gets very hot, and doesn't charge via the USB port in my vehicle, people say they can't hear me on the phone, that it cuts in and out, just over all, not happy with it.   NOTE: My previous device is not listed on your pull down menu, so I just chose a Samsung, but it was a Sony Xperia Z3":2017-01-24:NetterBug
Samsung Galaxy S7:Too big...a little complicated:This was one of the smaller phones offered in the store but it still does not fit easily in my hand. Android technology same asize my old phone but it seems like there are more steps to get something accomplished than before. I hate it. Hey.....only 2 more years tho.. grrrr:2017-01-23:Abcdefg123
Samsung Galaxy S7:Unsatisfied:I had the Galaxy Note 3 and was talked into get the Note 7, or thought it was time to update. Well we all know what happened to the Note 7 and so they gave me the S7 and just not happy with the phone at all and I believe it has to do with the size. I really do miss the screen size of the Note 3 and I still use it for most everything around the house.  Disappointed.:2017-01-22:BGMonreal
Samsung Galaxy S7:phone cracked while charging in less than 48 hrs:My son got the phone last Friday night.  He didn't drop the phone,  however, on Sunday his brother saw a crack on his screen, he turned the phone over and it was cracked on the back as well. After researching online,  it appears this has been an issue,  however,  when my son was picking between 2 phones he wasn't told about the phone's potential for cracking.  I'm less than impressed with bother Samsung and Verizon.  If the problem can't be remedied I will have no other choice but to switch carriers.:2017-01-22:S7 cracks while charging
Samsung Galaxy S7:I would prefer something else:I chose this phone because I thought it would be a great choice but I honestly don't like it very much. I loved my old phone but the screen messed up on it so I had to get a new phone. I prefer my old phone over this one:2017-01-19:Bridget63
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7 not so great:"I've grown up with Samsung, have had mostly every model...then came the S7. I've had so many problems that it's hard for support to remember, let alone remedy. I've been trying to work through them...and I assure you I'm no novice. So far everything has been to no avail. I'm not sure if I got a problem child or they're all like this, but I'll soon be in a Verizon store, either changing it for a different one, or trying the other ""7"". I had a note 4 and it was nearly flawless, but ,apparently it's still flying the friendly skies of United. To make this shorter, I'm not a happy camper. I just purchased a new modem/router to see if it would take less than 3 minutes to open a page, as well as not at all. It's fast but didn't help the phone any.":2017-01-17:Everything has been used
Samsung Galaxy S7:I'm not loving it like I hoped to:"I wanted to like this phone more; my last phone was a 2011 vintage LG.   I find the haptic system doesn't recognize taps around the periphery well / consistently which results in a lot of retyping.  I think part of the problem could be the screen protector.   The fingerprint sensing only seems to work 25% of the time.  Even though it's on Verizon, I don't find the coverage that great - I didn't have coverage when another friend w/ Verizon did - I had to reset the phone for it to find the network.  I don't find the navigation and some of the settings particularly intuitive - the back button in different apps is elusive and somehow I made the font a ridiculous 'reading for the blind"" size in 1 of my email apps and can't figure out how to change it back.    The positives - Photo quality is good, screen is great, charges fast.":2017-01-17:MelodiousSF
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery didn't last 24 before it needed to be charged:I don't use my phone that much, 2-3 hours of pandora and 1.5 hours of talking.  My battery was down to 14% after a full charge and the above usage.  Not what I expected from a new phone:2017-01-14:Jimbo 14
Samsung Galaxy S7:Ho-hum. Complicated settings and operation.:Although I wasn't a big fan of my Galaxy S4, I went ahead and purchased the S7, on a lark and because I was tired of being bugged about upgrading. So far, it's not bad. The settings are just as non-intuitive as the S4, or actually more so. Good camera and screen resolution.:2017-01-14:writetomichael
Samsung Galaxy S7:Don't waste the money:Same as old phone, no new updates. Nothing interesting or great about the phone so basic and photo quality is sub par:2017-01-13:Ktol
Samsung Galaxy S7:Low battery usage definitely like the s5 better:The s5 gives you the opportunity to expand the memory and the better. Has a better camera. Speeds are about the same. Clarity isn't much different. Stay with an s5 if you have one:2017-01-10:Mike99ooooiuikk
Samsung Galaxy S7:Difficult switch:No sure this was good choice for me.  Difficult switch to new features. Miss Wizard help. Screen guard chosen for me is not fitting properly too slick a touch:2017-01-08:Sad face 7
Samsung Galaxy S7:Should have gotten the s7 Edge:Same old Galaxy phone. I guess I shouldn't expect something different but with all of the reviews I guess I did. I don't like that you can't buy a phone the way you used to. Height of horizon tries to drag out payment forever. From now on you will constantly be paying for a phone.:2017-01-06:Punkslam21
Samsung Galaxy S7:........frustrated user:Went from the S5 to the S7, and am having difficulties figuring out how to maintain Internet service like I used to have. It's frustrating so far. I also just had 4 apps appear such as Z Camera and I have no idea why they are there now. I'm going through data usage really fast. I'm no expert, and I may have things set incorrectly but it's not been worth my investment yet.:2017-01-05:Irishbadger
Samsung Galaxy S7:New phone:While I like the features, I hate the size. Why no small Phones?  I have small hands. Unfortunately needed new phone because battery was bad in  old one:2017-01-03:Bobsled
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not sure I want to keep this 1:This phone has been giving me trouble. It flashes often as if it's going to go out on me.:2017-01-03:Wolfmain615
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good, but miss features of the IPhone:It was a good deal, but miss SIRI, Facetime, Photo Stream, and all of my specific software.   Had to buy new Apps for a different type of phone:2017-01-02:jjonkers
Samsung Galaxy S7:phone durability is extremely poor:I bought the phone a little over a week ago and the screen has already shattered. The phone had a case and took a small impact to the back corner which caused the face to crack. The forward camera has been rendered unusable due to the cracks over it.   The phone is not as durable as it should be for s device that people handle so regularly. The requirement for screen protectors and protective cases is absurde. My previous phone was a note 4 and survived far worse without any issue beside scuff marks on the edges.:2017-01-01:Samsung not my friend
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery Heats Up Fast:Gets very hot, very fast.:2017-01-01:Galaxyed Out
Samsung Galaxy S7:Less than a year and the flaws keep piling up...:I've never had an iPhone so I was thrilled to upgrage my Samsung GS5 to this GS7. Worked great for about 3 months then the problems began. The 64 GB memory card that came with it became corrupt and and I lost all my photos, videos, and music. Replaced it with another one and same thing happened a short while later. The back camera glass has now broken 3 times without me dropping the phone. The last time it was in my sweat pants pocket for five minutes while I was sitting on the couch. Pulled it out and broken glass! I cannot fathom how this happened as I hadn't moved! So I've replace the back camera glass 3 times and the camera itself 2 times. Some apps crash randomly, battery life is poor and getting worse, phone feels very hot to the touch occasionally, etc. With a year and 3 months left on this contract, I am considering making the switch already to something more reliable.:2017-01-01:shovork1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Was not impressed at all.:Not happy with phone at all....not what I expected.:2017-01-01:smhicks28
Samsung Galaxy S7:it is ok... missing the handsfree app s5 had for the car....reallly missss it:bought it 3 months ago and wish i had my s5 back:2016-12-31:cetrine
Samsung Galaxy S7:Misinformed. Takes longer to charge than my s5. Gets hot easy.:Not helpful at all when there's a problem.  Too expensive.:2016-12-30:Meandphil1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not did great:It is OK not great would like a better phone:2016-12-30:Mochakeke
Samsung Galaxy S7:Same as the old phone:I see no differences between the 4 and the 7 other than some things are even harder to get to work:2016-12-30:Drew1234
Samsung Galaxy S7:Sim card didn't work missed family calls from Europe and out of state:Missed Christmas calls was on the phone for over 90 min didn't fix the problem had to go to a Verizon store wait over an hour to get a new card:2016-12-29:Rothmann0211
Samsung Galaxy S7:We find it difficult to navigate with many symbols that are not easily explained:If only the phones came with an instruction booklet like they used too it would be very helpful. Going back and forth to techs at the store is time consuming and most of them go so fast through the explanations that it is difficult to keep up. Wish they offered classes like the apple stores.:2016-12-29:nonethatiwant
Samsung Galaxy S7:similar to s4 I had:this phone was supposed to have a super battery and fast charging.  I don' t use it heavily and the battery does not last 8 hrs. it does come on faster thans the 4.  You have my email incorrect in the system. was very unhappy with the rep that assited me.:2016-12-28:drlmes
Samsung Galaxy S7:Too small:I had a Note 2 which leads loved.:2016-12-28:Hero1881
Samsung Galaxy S7:Poor Performance on the Galaxy 7:i bought this phone and got poor customer services, then the phone starts acting up and no one in the verizon stores can get it to work correctly, i keep getting sound of notifications but no notifications:2016-12-27:robert13
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not as expected from Samsung:I bought this 2 weeks ago, and no one explained that you had deleted some of the key features needed to make the phone a worth while investment! I am very sad that you decided to delete the sensitivity of the touch screen to be used by persons wearing gloves. I'm not happy!:2016-12-27:Rick1436
Samsung Galaxy S7:A lot of features.  Maybe too many:I got this phone a couple of weeks ago.  It's nice but I have difficulty finding out what it can do:2016-12-26:Jefrey
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's Just OK:I was basically forced to get this phone because I had to turn in my Note 7 that I had no problems whatsoever with.  I don't like this phone, I want my Note back. I cannot wait until the Note 8 comes out, I hope there's no issue this time around.:2016-12-26:Sthrncal951
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy 7:Thought the screen was bigger, doesn't hold a charge very long Wish I would have gone with the iphone:2016-12-24:Bmc61
Samsung Galaxy S7:Poor battery life!:I purchased this less than a month ago and I am taking it back.  I have to charge the phone every night.  The battery drains in less than 12 hrs.  Most of the time my phone is on stand by.:2016-12-24:scoutmom4
Samsung Galaxy S7:Downgrade from S5:I assumed staying with the samsung line of phones that i would be happy. Wrong, i was happier with my s5. The s7 has crappie reception i drop more calls than ever before. The phone shows i have sevice and yet drops calls were the S5 would carry the call. If I hadn't cracked the back of the phone it would've been returned. I didnt purchase a case for phone because after day 3 I knew I didn't want to keep the phone.  The S7 burnt through 5.05 gb of data in one morning which Verizon was more than happy to take care of. Very unsatisfied with the phone but am stuck with it now.:2016-12-24:CJaco
Samsung Galaxy S7:Sound comes and goes:When talking on phone it sounds like the other person is far away and then close again..:2016-12-23:Sjwebbie
Samsung Galaxy S7:Takes great pictures but that's it.:It constantly drops my email server where I have to continuelly put in my password to reconnect it. It takes forever to load pages off the Internet where my iPhone 6 was instant. Not easy to figure out how to use and comes with a lot of useless apps that drain your battery.  The only good thing is the camera. Would love to get my iPhone back.:2016-12-22:Aline
Samsung Galaxy S7:Too different from iphone.:I hate your positive blurbs that are so honey crusted. I am planning to return the phone.:2016-12-21:Dojah
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone review:The phone is a headache. I was better off before I traded up. I can't believe I now have to pay a monthly fee to have voice mail. Ridiculous.:2016-12-21:triple x
Samsung Galaxy S7:Horribly different:"I thought I was upgrading from an s5 to s7. I cannot stand the changes. It is not easy to adapt to the changes. I am definitely not happy with the ""upgrade.""":2016-12-17:jnichoje
Samsung Galaxy S7:Calls break up, videos are pixalated, not happy with the LG phone:I like the phone and the apps, but I am having a hard time with calls breaking up and the 4g does not always come in.  Videos are fuzzy sometimes, and doing any kind of live streaming is always pixelated.  I do not know how to fix this.  I got this new phone about 15 days ago, I already had to switch it due to the phone.  Not really sure how to fix this, but am really tired of not having calls come in well.  Never had this with my old phone, which was not an LG.:2016-12-16:Aniiyah
Samsung Galaxy S7:not as many pages to store apps or quick apps ...phone gets very hot when using it i feel like it is going to burn up some days.  Slow at charging too:I have had this for almost 3 weeks.  the glass protector does not fit right.  It already broke on the edge because it is not designed right to fit on the phone....:2016-12-13:captgeo7
Samsung Galaxy S7:Ok phone.  A dissapointment from my older S3:The S7 is much faster than my old S3.  The camera is great.  However, they have oversimplified everything and taken away most options...The predictive text is terrible.  The S3 had a way to improve this as you went by selecting the correct word but it wasn't off much.  The S7 is terrible....Most choices it provides aren't even words.:2016-12-12:CrazyLarry
Samsung Galaxy S7:Email Does Not Sync Properly:Unlike my Galaxy S5, the S7 has a buggy email program, using the 'standard' email app with a POP3 account.  Messages that have been deleted and no longer exist on the server are piling up in the phone's inbox, and you can't make them go away, even after another email app has deleted them from the server.:2016-12-12:johlson
Samsung Galaxy S7:very disapointed with galaxy s7:replaces my note 7 with galaxy s7.  battery barely last the day. phone is hotter than my note every got.   would not recommend this phone to anyone.:2016-12-12:ddcddd
Samsung Galaxy S7:Was not easy to make the so called up grade:Purchased 10 days ago horrible decision:2016-12-08:Handicap
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not easy to navigate through.:I wish I would have stayed with the S6! The S7 does not have the same functions, if anything less functions than the S6!:2016-12-06:Nik126
Samsung Galaxy S7:Miss my S4:I bought this phone on black Friday. I was excited to get it, but after a few days I realized my S4 had many more options for customizing. This phone does not do near as much as my S4. My S7 loses signal where my S4 never did.:2016-12-06:rlbryan74
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nothing really new here:Nothing really exciting with the new phone  Better camera more battery less screens You can use folders but nothing to brag about Its a good replacement for my s4:2016-12-04:Thorth
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very disappointing so far:Had it a week and  have found it does not work as good as my old S5.  It hurts my head to talk on it for any length of time.  Setting it to power saver seems to help a little with this.  I loose calls, can't hear people.  They had to disable the Hi-def sound feature immediately, as it would truncate the sound so I couldn't hear and those I spoke to couldn't hear me.  Ya the camera is better than the S5.:2016-12-04:Unimpressed S7 Owner
Samsung Galaxy S7:does not hold charge:does not hold a charge as stated in their adds. The most useage time I have gotton is 10 hrs:2016-12-04:chuck1414
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not really impressed:Other than a better camera and sharper display there's not much difference between it and my old S3. Keyboard is a pain,you have to HIT the space bar precisely and firmly to space words. Returning it and waiting for Samsung to come out with a non incinerating Note. Until then I'll keep using my Note 3.:2016-12-04:Note user
Samsung Galaxy S7:Overrated:I am not really impressed with this phone.  I had a Droid turbo before I got this Galaxy S7. It was 10 times the phone. My service is worse.  Can't seem to get a good volume.  It's either to load and funny sounding or quiet.:2016-12-03:Ljgraham
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not reliable:One reason I purchased this phone was for the ability to use it as a WiFi hotspot and to use the USB tethering capability.  The USB tethering is not working at all and the USB hot spot stopped working within a day after I had the Verizon store ste it up.  I had to get the stores assistance as the hotspot function didn't work after I first received the phone.  Our other cell phone is a Lumina 735 that I have no problems with after I upgraded to Windows 10 with the assistance of a Microsoft Store.  I would have bought another windows phone if I was convinced that Microsoft was still supporting their Nokia line, and if Verizon would finally make a windows 10 phone directly available.:2016-12-03:Kahu
Samsung Galaxy S7:Hated the non removable battery!:I had the s5 but really hated the non removable battery on the s7. Really wish I hadn't bought this stupid phone.:2016-12-03:Boxhdn
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery Life:I got the S7 8 days ago... For it being the top phone in Consumer Reports I figured it has to be good! I definitely don't love it! The battery life is absolutely horrible!!!:2016-12-01:MCYJ
Samsung Galaxy S7:Audio stopped working:Bought this as a replacement to my 2 Note7s that kept getting recalled.  It was smaller than I'd like but I think I was just used to having a big screen...no biggie.   Then within a month of owning this my audio stopped working properly.  Phone calls I could hear the person and then I couldn't.   Watching videos the sound would go in and out for big gaps of time.  Music I couldn't even listen to just kept going off without even touching my phone.  3 factory resets and lengthy calls to Samsung and Verizon tech support and they couldn't figure it out. Never dropped my phone, Otterbox case and never got it wet.  This may have been a fluke incident but after only 3 Samsung Phones in 3 months and still having an issue I gave up on it.  Kudos for Verizon for understanding frustrations and allowing me to switch to a completely different device past the 14 day window.:2016-12-01:LouMimzy
Samsung Galaxy S7:First time with Samsung after long run with Motorola. It is vastly different so there is a hugh learning curve. Battery life is poor.:You need to bring back training classes for folks transitioning to a new phone esp when it's a change in manufacturer:2016-11-30:JRphone
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone but disappointed:Phone looks nice and has nice features but the Bluetooth disconnects very frequently. Also very concerning I only have the phone a few days and it restarted randomly around 5 times so far. Last is that it gets very very hot when charging.:2016-11-27:Dissed99938
Samsung Galaxy S7:Horrible battery life...:The phone's a good size. Decently fast processor, decent camera. But I literally have to charge it 3 times a day. Luckily, between the battery having tiny cells and coming with a fast-charger, it doesn't take all that long, but still incredibly frustrating.:2016-11-20:mcgrantly91
Samsung Galaxy S7:Horrible consolation for the note7:If we are forced to turn our phones in at least they could do is offer comparable phones. The s7 feels like a toy in comparison to the note7. Not to mention that the mandatory change cost the customer money but cost Samsung very little and it appears that Verizon made money to give the customers inferior phones.:2016-11-20:Randy88888
Samsung Galaxy S7:Miss my note7:I was forced to do the trade in and reluctantly did so. After visiting the store 3 times to get this resolved from Samsung and Verizon I have been informed that the information I was given at the time of return was not accurate so I will be missing out on many dollars that was promised to me to return my Note 7. As far as the phone I have the S7 now and it does not even come close to working the same as my Note 7 and then very disgusted now that I am trapped with this phone.:2016-11-20:Steinwand
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not as good as I expected:First of all this is my second galaxy s7. I had the first for a week and then it crashed on me. I had to spend nearly anew hour waiting for a new phone.  Not Verizons fault but my time is my money and I shouldnt have had to waste my time doing that.  This phone hasn't done anything special.  My Droid turbo performed the same but with a better battery.  I haven't noticed any improvements. Yeah the camera is good but not a huge deal for me. I still have apps crash randomly. To me, it's a typical phone.  I wished I wouldn't have upgraded.:2016-11-18:Claytilt
Samsung Galaxy S7:Had to exchange:I had a note7, and it feels like a tremendous downgrade compared to what I was used to. Some of the features I used to use are gone.:2016-11-17:Collin Gallagher
Samsung Galaxy S7:I hate it:I had the Galaxy Note 7 but had to turn it in. So I got the S7. Didn't want it and I don't like it doesn't seem to hold Wi-Fi reception as good as my Note 7 I cannot assign ringtones even though I save them everybody has the same ringtone.  Has no S Pen which I have relied on because I was a note person for years.  Nothing really impressive about this phone at all. How do you expect me to give a good review when I was forced into taking a phone I really didn't want?:2016-11-16:Beauty4u
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not a fan of this platform:I wish I had a note7:2016-11-14:Smittyjenkins
Samsung Galaxy S7:i was not EVER givien basic training on how to use it so i still am trying to figure it out!!!!:have NO idea how to use it fully or even basically ! ! ! (sad face):2016-11-14:phx1029
Samsung Galaxy S7:Terrible:I am a loyal Droid owner for years.  Always loved them.  Upgraded from the S5 to the S7. Everything about the phone is perfectly fine except the durability. My phone cracked within 24 hours of purchasing.  My husband went about 3 weeks and his cracked also.  Do not buy this phone without a sturdy case.  I'm very disappointed in how fragile this phone is.  For how expensive these phones are they should be more durable.:2016-11-11:Crackedphone77
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very poor signal:I have had the phone almost a month and I am ready to trade it for something else.  I have dropped more calls with this phone than I ever did with any of my old phones.  I am very disappointed in this phone, I love Samsung but definitely not the Samsung Galaxy S7:2016-11-10:slw8296
Samsung Galaxy S7:I don't like Samsung phones:I have had this samsung for about 6 months and I hate it... it over heats when charging and when it's not on the charger it still over heats. Also it backs out in apps that you are using.. I will never get a Samsung Galaxy 7s again......:2016-11-09:Smiley2356
Samsung Galaxy S7:it's ok:It has a small screen and runs kind of slow.:2016-11-07:Tiggertim12
Samsung Galaxy S7:Bad phone:Got this a few months ago and was very disappointed. Horrible battery life, people can't hear me sometimes and bad reception. I'm a truck driver and need a reliable phone for work so ended up having to spend over$200 to get out from under it. Upgraded to the pixel xl and so far so good.:2016-11-03:Turbosucks
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy 7 teview.:I purchased the galaxy 7 because the note 7 was discontinued.  I wanted the s7 edge but they did not have them. I liked the not 7. I don't like the s7. Should have gotten the new iphone. Not happy:2016-11-02:Jaryou phone
Samsung Galaxy S7:Slow:Bought it when I switched to Verizon 2 weeks ago. Battery life is terrible, doesn't get good reception, everything just seems slower & way worse than the S6 I had with at&t:2016-11-02:Hytrd788
Samsung Galaxy S7:Camera is the only upgrade:I prefer my S5 over this phone. Options & settings are not as good anymore. You can't group emails by date, adjust keyboard sensitivity, in call pop-up is gone, & sound clips are different to name a few. The only upgraded feature is the camera & the space.:2016-11-02:aeb77
Samsung Galaxy S7:Too small for me.:I'm used to the Samsung Note line of phones. I'm used to the bigger phones with more features. Trying to get used to this phone and functions. But quiet not satisfied with the s7.:2016-11-01:T_Rob
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not as good as the 5:I missed 5 voice mails because I can't called them up or even find them as easily as on the 5...it often switches screens randomly when I'm in the middle of somethin:2016-11-01:Kbkat
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not really worth the price for its features.:I recently upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy 4 and I really am not impressed with the upgrades. I think we are being stifled in buying the latest edition and I truly don't think what they are coming out with are innovations.:2016-10-31:Billyjoe1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Under water:"I bought the S7 on 10/14. Call quality was poor. Exchanged for another new S7. Call quality is fair to poor. I have to use the speaker to get better quality sound. Very disappointed. :(":2016-10-27:Sandyt503
Samsung Galaxy S7:Cool camera:I bought this less than a month ago and I dislike it so much, I almost want to go to an IPhone. I didn't feel that way with my last Galaxy.:2016-10-25:NV1974
Samsung Galaxy S7:Features Don't Merritt the cost to up grade from s5 to s7:The cost to upgrade from s5 to s7 is not with the cost the camera and screen quality are better but not for the cost they took away a lot of features to set settings and customize They need to develop a way to transfer the settings to the new phone so you don't have to spend a lot of time setting up apps and account passwordso not a smooth transition:2016-10-25:Nnovak8724
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointed:"Bought two of the Galaxy S7's about a week ago and in under 48hrs, both screens had cracked.  We expected all the promises of ""water resistant, crack resistant, etc"" to be true. We didn't go try to test that theory, but a simple drop because of our young children getting ahold of them proved it false.  Definitely disappointed with the lack of durability. Also, we were told the new bigger battery (we upgraded from the S5) had been tested to last thru 18hrs of non-stop streaming. Within about 6hrs of getting our phones they were dead.  The battery life is extremely pathetic and we don't even have the  s7 edge. The features of the phone itself are nice and we enjoy using it.":2016-10-23:Etapia42
Samsung Galaxy S7:Poor touch screen and slow:Bought 13 days ago, miss my old Samsung, touch screen hard to get it to type, slow access to web, if I didn't live 2 hours from store I'd take it back:2016-10-23:Jessicav1
Samsung Galaxy S7:6025520375:I upgraded from an S5 to an S7 and the S5 was much faster and gave me less issues. I lose connection to the internet even though I'm on Wifi and my data won't work at times. My calls drop after 1 ring. It's been awful.:2016-10-23:StevenUchiha
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointed:Ended up switching to this after having to return two NOTE7's. Big disappointment. Battery doesn't hold like my old iPhone 5 did when it was new. Definitely more customization options than an iPhone, but seems slower and has more junk on it out of the box that you have to delete. Big disappointment. I did like the Note... other than the explosions and recall fiasco.:2016-10-22:Turkleton
Samsung Galaxy S7:NOT SHATTER RESISTANT! Also, aggravating.:"I had this phone for less than one week, the Verizon associate assured me that it was shatter resistant and that the screen was very durable. I DROPPED IT ON THE CARPET and the screen shattered to bits... Also, the associate told me that my contacts had been downloaded, and after telling him 3 times that only some were there, he assured me that they all were.. well they aren't, and apparently Samsung and Google do not communicate well enough to show all contacts. For example, when i try to call ""the office"" I have to type the entire phone number into the keypad and it does not recognize it as a saved number. However, when ""the office"" calls me all of the contact information is there... This is not in any way useful nor is it an improvement from my HTC One M8 which I am strongly considering going back to.":2016-10-20:shayeberz
Samsung Galaxy S7:I liked the Note 7!!!:I liked having the note 7. I had to downgrade! I understand the safety concerns but I'm still not happy with having to get a phone I didn't want!:2016-10-19:Fgbvdtjbdtgb
Samsung Galaxy S7:it not too good:I have use this phone to offen, and not too many apps and battery still run down, and it slow charging, it tak about 2 hours to get  fully charge, I had sony Z3V it take 45 min to 1 hours charge, I switch back to sony phone:2016-10-18:Ninjataz31
Samsung Galaxy S7:works well, has some quirkes:I have had my phone almost 2 weeks. It does NOT play nice with glass screen protectors. The phone is slightly rounded on the outside edges meaning you will have an air bubble almost 1/4 inch wide straight up and down the sides of your phone. not a good option. Also the speaker is bad on this phone. there is only one on the bottom of the phone by the charging port. the sound is not directed well and if you want to watch a show you have to cup your hand to get sound to you. Even doing that the sound does not have good clarity. Over all I regret buying this phone.:2016-10-17:Edward Grey
Samsung Galaxy S7:It just ok:Feels like I bought an iPhone again. App icons looks the same from several years ago. Sure S7 is fast but the battery drain gives me about much as up time as my 3 ½ year old Nokia 928 Windows phone. Then it feels like I need to be PC administrator pro to reduce the battery drain or even uninstall apps. Silly. Still bummed Microsoft bought Nokia killing a great phone company. And Microsoft making app makers rewrite apps 3 times in the last few years each for new platform leaving few apps for a Microsoft phone.:2016-10-15:JustaGuy2000
Samsung Galaxy S7:Too many steps back:OS is much more restrictive that Galaxy S5.  Apps have become more complicated to use:2016-10-12:Gio1
Samsung Galaxy S7:fragile phone:I had S6 and wanted the latest greatest.  I thought I ordered the edge but mistakenly ordered s7.  Most fragile phone I have ever had.  dropped 11 inches and the back spidered.  Slipped off of a desk and both sides cracked like safety glass.  very disappointed.:2016-10-12:kstar1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7:We bought out phones Sunday, Oct. 2 & we have had a lot of issues with them! My husband was trying to call his son & it wouldn't go out. We do not get half the service we use too. It just not like our other phones! We are very disappointed in these phones.:2016-10-10:Acuff
Samsung Galaxy S7:I like my old phone:I have had this phone a couple weeks now. the battery drains so fast. Not happy. Sure it charges back up pretty quick, but it also drains fast. So what happens when you are some where you can not recharge. Disappointing. I cant believe I am stuck with this for 2 years.:2016-10-10:souza15
Samsung Galaxy S7:not too thrilled:This is my 3 Samsung phone and it's the least impressive cell phone to date.  The buttons aren't sensitive, the battery drains very fast, and the Wi-Fi Antenna (primary reason why I traded in my old phone) isn't much better if better at all.:2016-10-10:SFAgogeDada
Samsung Galaxy S7:Hard to use:Head replacement phone butt somebody else's phone caught on fire had no choice what to replace this not taking that chance of a fire this phone is a downgrade:2016-10-09:Duncan1106
Samsung Galaxy S7:Why is the back made of breakable glass??:The design of the back of the phone is the reason for my low. Why is it made of something that can shatter? I was going to put my phone in my pocket while sitting on my bed and I missed my pocket. It only fell about 2.5ft onto a hardwood floor. When I picked it up, the back had a large crack that spread out across the back of the phone. I have a glass screen protector, but am still waiting for my case to arrive in the mail (it's currently about 3 days out). I just got this phone (9/28) and it's all ready falling apart faster than my old phone (I had the Galaxy S4 and it survived 2 years with only a few dings on the side and I did drop it a few times without a case on. The phone performs amazingly well and it is unfortunate that the outside design is not on the same level as the internal workings of the phone.:2016-10-09:jjaeck
Samsung Galaxy S7:Pretty Display screen but not as easy to use as the S5:I bought this over a week ago. I'd like to change over to IPhone but the storage is way too expensive monthly. So my biggest pet peeves are the  1. text messaging-  2. where the buttons are located- I keep turning the sound down accidentally. 3. the keyboard touch sensitivity-  i have to push hard for the space bar to work.  I can't snap screenshots easily because the button has been moved since the S7 is much smaller than the S5. the screens are the same size but the phone is smaller. The text messaging program that I used on S5 was the default program that came with the phone, it was simple and kept the icons of my favorites up the top. I could change the background color of the conversation list so it wouldn't be so bright. With the s7 that is no longer an option. Also my finger keeps pressing on the volume button by mistake. So now my phone is on vibrate when I want it to ring. They say it takes 21 days to form new habits so I hope this will help me like this phone more.:2016-10-07:ShazMatazz
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great Phone and Features - Poor Battery:Can only use it for 5 minutes before it gets too hot to handle.:2016-10-05:YerDadd3
Samsung Galaxy S7:too fragile:"I have had this phone for a week.  It took ONE small drop, and the back now has a huge spiderweb crack.  Lucky for me, it's on the back and usable.  And, while I have ""insurance"" on it -- paying the ""deductible"" would mean that I'd end up paying an extra $200.  Overall the phone is nice, works well, but not worth it if you have kids.  I suspect that even with it in it's case and with the screen protector, it will break again. I've been rough on all my other phones and have never had them break this way.":2016-10-03:KaiMom
Samsung Galaxy S7:had for 5 days:Had this phone for 5 days after the phone did an update the camera stopped working:2016-10-02:1tturner
Samsung Galaxy S7:Eh....much to be desired.:Only 70% of phone numbers transfered from backup.  No MHL support is a joke, especially after the salesman at the Verizon store said my cord would still work.  I might actually like my  S4 better.  Too bad the screen quit working.:2016-10-02:Sdak87
Samsung Galaxy S7:Too expensive:Too expensive, Although Samsung does make a good phone.:2016-10-01:unsatisfied131313
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy S7:I do not like that a message count cannot be set for anything, text messages, emails, FB, twitter, etc. I really need this feature which makes my 4 a better phone. I don't like the keyboard.  On the plus side the camera is great and takes stunning pictures.:2016-10-01:kenn5150
Samsung Galaxy S7:Low Battery life:Much better than an iPhone but battery doesn't last to long and phone is always a little warmer than I'd like:2016-09-30:Rooker89
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not impressed:Battery over hearts regularly.  Phone has reset itself to factory twice not even in a week that I've owned it:2016-09-29:Vtank
Samsung Galaxy S7:Runs hot....battery life not good:Just transitioned. Phone overheats with only 5 to 7 minutes web browsing. Battery life far less than S5.:2016-09-27:Amberbunny
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not as many features as my S5 had:I've had this a week and like my S5 bettet:2016-09-26:Amyleigh
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good Phone, left much to be desired after switch from my last device.:I switched to the Galaxy from a Windows phone I'd been using for 4 years. I have really struggled to make the transition and prefer the other OS over Android by far. Of course having a greater selection of apps is nice, but those apps are much more confusing to manage (notifications off or on, etc). The camera is noticeably inferior to the one I had and the stock camera program is frustrating. What I find is that every app they present you with needs to be replaced with an aftermarket one that meets your expectations, but doesn't quite sync well with the phone. I've also noticed I have to click, swipe, or drag about 40% more to do the same operations I used to do. Could some of this be OS switch syndrome? Probably, but I'm returning the device this week as I'm thoroughly unimpressed and underwhelmed for the price. I'm also missing more calls, texts, and emails than ever and I'm tired of explaining that I'm still trying to get used to a new phone. I'll try the iphone next and hope for the best. The 14 day return policy at Verizon is helpful in this regard.:2016-09-26:groq
Samsung Galaxy S7:Wish I hadn't upgraded:I traded in my S5 for this phone.  While it has some improvements they aren't enough to make up for the SHORT battery life. Overall I wish I had looked at some of the other phones.:2016-09-24:jdpuller60
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not much difference between this phone and the S5.:Wish I could have tried it out. Thought the Camara would be better. Still think there is more to it. Guess I will figure it out Inow time.:2016-09-22:Me99999
Samsung Galaxy S7:really not great:can't figure out things  face changes with the slightest touch nothing is easily figured out.:2016-09-20:want my old phone back
Samsung Galaxy S7:Horrible WiFi, No IR, Short Battery Life, No Default Storage:Upgraded from S5, cannot get a decent WiFi unless I am next to router. No infrared for using as a remote. Battery is dead in 8 hours or so. Cannot save to SD card...you have to manually move each file.:2016-09-20:doerdie111
Samsung Galaxy S7:KEYPAD is far too small:You'd think after we keep getting told technology is improving that a 7th edition to the s series would be the ultimate. Instead the keypad once again is too small , smaller than my s5 and the touch screen  on both sides/edges still needs improvement unless you have tiny fingers.:2016-09-19:jettech
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not happy:I have had wifi issues the entire time I've had this phone. The touch is overly sensitive, and the auto brightness is horrible. My personal experience with this product has been terrible. I'm on my 3rd replacement phone.:2016-09-18:Danfak1985
Samsung Galaxy S7:Wish I'd gotten something else:It's small and freezes frequently.  Not impressed.:2016-09-18:HollieBee89
Samsung Galaxy S7:Basic. I was expecting more:It is smaller than what I expected. It feels cheap and it is slow.:2016-09-17:Megsum
Samsung Galaxy S7:Was not an easy transition from old phone...:Every icon has a new service with added fee, rather than just working as old phone....i.e. voicemail icon -- don't want visual voicemail - no way to bypass. Free 250k memory card -- can't get the purchase date to populate -- no phone number to call anyone -- email address doesn't work:2016-09-16:Tansmile
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not impressed.:"I bought this phone in May 2016 and already my screen has lost its brilliance and has a yellow tint. Now more than likely I'll get stuck with a ""certified like new"" replacement.":2016-09-15:Josh5673
Samsung Galaxy S7:Meh. Least exciting new phone ever.:Not a significant perceptible improvement from previous S6. Does not work with some of my Bluetooth devices. Severe buyer's remorse.:2016-09-14:RoCo12
Samsung Galaxy S7:4352413765:"new phone keeps dropping numbers...incoming and outgoing calls drop in a few seconds....have returned to the store twice to have someone fix the phone....each time I am told problem is fixed.......nope not true........today the NEW phone had to be ""fixed"" again.......":2016-09-13:Harry1H25
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not as great as expected:I went through 3 phones before finding one that didn't overheat. Poor signal on my usual driving routes but once connected with a good one the HD calling is great:2016-09-12:Ca2nygrl
Samsung Galaxy S7:Poor performance:I upgraded my Galaxy 5 Stocker which was a mistake. My Galaxy7 has more features but poor performance. People I talk to can't hear me and I often have to put it on speaker so they can. Plus I get dropped calls DAILY. I have returned two phones due to these problems and my current one still has the same problems.:2016-09-10:Tj3hope
Samsung Galaxy S7:Sub par at best...:I have had my S7 for about 3wks, I am not loving it at all, honestly don't understand all the high reviews. Apparently most that review this phone are Samsung phone loyalists...  My last phone was an LG G4, my first LG phone ever.  I would gladly go back to it albeit for mother board bricking issues. I have had to reboot this phone multiple times due to lag or freezing up. The call clarity as well as speaker volume is horrendous!  The touchwiz user interface is terrible and antiquated.  Feels and looks too much like an icrapper. I would honestly go back to my 8+yr old Motorola Razor instead of having this phone!  Do yourself a favor and specifically choose a phone with superb call clarity as well as loud volume. Camera is mediocre at best, edited software I terrible, no IR support and not so good battery life in my opinion.  You WILL be disappointed with the S7, I know I am.... Good luck!:2016-09-10:Gardion1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nothing too special about it had a grand prime before and it's the same just faster:Nothing too special about it had a grand prime before and it's the same just faster. Was hoping for more features more phone options:2016-09-10:Stellareyna5940
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's OK.:The only things  I like about the new S7 are the longer battery life and the HD speakerphone. Other than that it's not any better. I actually think my S4  was better than this, it's disappointing.:2016-09-07:Jlynnmil
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung needs to replace my phone within 1 month:No data connection most times when off WiFi. Verizon replaced SIM card and still does it  Samsung will have to replace it.:2016-09-06:Rpforme
Samsung Galaxy S7:Touch is a little off on the edges:Touch is a little of on the edges:2016-09-04:Rigverdu
Samsung Galaxy S7:Problems:I've only had it a week and a half and have had numerous problems. Getting  to hot to touch  at times, screen going black, restarting on it's own.  Took it to the store and got some adjustments made, it stopped over heating but still goes blank sometimes  and restarts on its own. I do lime the phone would would like one that works like it should:2016-09-03:JeanetteC
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone:I like the phone and features.:2016-08-16:Cremy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Why is this so heavily hyped?:Nice package. I bought in to the numbers they publish and thought it would be a nice upgrade. My last two HTC phones have been really good. Dependable. Fast. Reliable. Samsung is glitchy. Freezes. Must repeatedly attempt to down pages. Loses GPS even when stationary. Went online and they have pages devoted to trying to make it work like a normal phone. Bad sign. I should have got the HTC M9. Also it likes to force your email, messaging and voice mail on to confusing proprietary apps. Next time it's back to HTC unless an update comes along that makes it work like it should.:2016-08-16:Jim McCord
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not impressed:I've had this model just over a week and I am definitely missing my galaxy S4 that I previously had. The S7 already has cracks all over the back side and the battery seems to run through way faster than my old phone. I was expecting a definite upgrade feel from my last phone and I must say I just don't get that with this model. Even the camera isn't as impressive as I was expecting which is a major feature that I use. Hopefully I can make it through the next 3 years with this thing...:2016-08-14:Genco44
Samsung Galaxy S7:Like the IPhone better:I had a S6 Galaxy and loved it, had IPhone for short period of time and was hard to adjust to but I actually think I like it better and want the iPhone back.:2016-08-13:heymake
Samsung Galaxy S7:poor bluetooth when connected to two things:the car bluetooth will not work if i have my gear2 watch connected.:2016-08-11:vtphone
Samsung Galaxy S7:s7:the 2 s7 i have on my lines are both cracked already... junk:2016-08-11:scrayl2
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very disappointed:I had to get a new phone as I ran mine over. An I'm hard on phones as I work outside an always using it.     Had the Motorola Droid turbo an had been looking at either the new Motorola Droid or going back to HTC but everyone kept telling me how great Samsung Galaxy phone was.  I told the sales guy I wanted to go with the HTC since the Motorola doesn't have ability to put an SD card in.    But then I found out the HTC has the new style charging port which sucks as I have a car charger in every truck an tractor, which is probably close to 15-20 new chargers I'd have to buy to not have to remember a charger everywhere I go.  So I decided to go with the galaxy S7 since it has micro USB charger.   Well I hate it.    The battery life sucks.    Fully charged at 8 am an dead by noon 2pm at the latest.  My old turbo would atleast make it till 5-6 pm on average.     2- there no speed dialing.   You have to click the green call symbol everytime you call someone.     3- phone will turn ringer to silent on its own.  Which must be a Samsung thing as my brother-in-laws does it do.   4- if your in your text messages an don't click back when your done an just leave a text open it won't notify of any new messages until you click back to main screen of texts.   5- apps you habe downloaded don't stay in ABC order must click ABC every time you open your app page.    Now for the pros- camera takes good pictures an someone finally put a flash for the back camera.    An there is a lot of choices for accessories as everyone makes something for a Samsung.:2016-08-11:farmboy_85
Samsung Galaxy S7:Meh:Too many ways to do the same thing. Lacks some of the features I would use all the time or at least I haven't figured out how or where to find them.  I miss my iphone:2016-08-10:RnJenn
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7 is not an upgrade for me:I upgraded from Galaxy S4 a couple of weeks ago. With the S4 I had great service and mobile reception. With the S7 all I have is dropped calls and no bars most of the time. The local techs put a new sim card in - it has made no difference.:2016-08-09:danceswithstars
Samsung Galaxy S7:Touch screen problems:When sending text message or choosing to respond to a FaceBook post, when I type my message and hit send, it doesn't sent...I have to do it over and over to send it.  I was told I should disable draw over or overlay for all apps..I did that but now wondering if there is something that I need that feature for.:2016-08-09:KathieL711
Samsung Galaxy S7:Hard to work:I bought this phone a week ago and its really hard to figure out and has just become a hassle.:2016-08-08:Whit4391
Samsung Galaxy S7:Problems within 4 days:Smaller and more confusing, overheats, feels a lot less secure:2016-08-07:Really disappointed 68
Samsung Galaxy S7:I'm disappointed with the issues I continue to have.:This is my 2nd S7 and both have had issues with freezing up on the time screen and running slowly with the camera.  The gallery loads slowly and freezes although the camera does take good pictures.:2016-08-07:blr813
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung:I only have this phone for one week & have taken it back twice. The group texting & sending attachments  with a text is not working..one more time & I  want a new phone:2016-08-06:Dog catcher
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not a great:battery drains overnight:2016-08-06:KPatel
Samsung Galaxy S7:Lacks user options, difficult to set user prefereneces. Text changes words, did not transfer contacts etc from other phone correctly:I hate this phone and would love to return it. Cuts in & out during calls. No regular voice-mail,  very few apps, speech to text is a joke it never gets the words correct (S4 was better), uses/eats data just sitting ???, can't turn off notifications, doesn't recognize current e-mail, Google other accounts & passworder, won't  accept password resets ie. invalid. My S4 was much better except camera. This phones options are like my way or the highway and that's  where it might end up. Also the new Verizon app is the worst can't  change or set anything. Change it back!:2016-08-03:3306088417
Samsung Galaxy S7:I hate the S7:Terrible phone. Slow loading email, overly sensitive screen, TERRIBLE sound quality and WiFi connection issues (no other device has connection issues). What a waste of money. And I despise that the glass cover doesn't actually fit the screen so there is a edge gap all the way around the phone screen. I bought it because it received great reviews and I seriously don't understand why.:2016-08-02:Desertdweller1116
Samsung Galaxy S7:see no differences between S4 and now S7 WISH I hadnt tried to upgrade...not even speed is different..expected MORE:See no differences between S4 and now S7 WISH I hadn't tried to upgrade...not even speed is different..expected MORE:2016-08-02:phannum
Samsung Galaxy S7:YES:I JUST GOT THIS THIS JULY AND I HATE IT MY 4 WAS BETTER EASIER TO USE KEYBROAD LETTERS ARE TO SMALL:2016-08-01:LUCKIE229
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointing signal reception performance:Changed to S7 from Motorola Razr Maxx and the S7 is poorer in signal reception than the Motorola. For example, I cannot make or receive calls from my desk at work, and that was never a problem with the Motorola. The Motorola would drop to 3G, but the S7 goes to 1X if at all.:2016-07-30:efs99
Samsung Galaxy S7:Deny or Allow all? Hi Paul!:This phone is for the business oriented person, not the average user who only needs to call, text, email, and play games. What's with all the permissions? Why would certain  functions need to record my conversations? Why were the calendar highlights taken away? Phone gets very hot when just laying on a hard surface. Four updates in 5 days?? My old phone was a S4 mini; that phone was much better than this one! So what, if the camera is clearer. This phone will blind someone with how bright the screen is! The screen protector that Verizon sells doesn't even cover the entire screen. Thanks!!! Every function/app requests permission to access my phone functions i.e., contacts, photos, personal usage, at anytime. Really??? Why? Nope, not interested in all that! The connection still kicks rocks, I've had 1G in my status bar. That is a shame with their always 4G, best 4G this and that. Honestly? I see why Paul said 'Bye'...:2016-07-29:WinnMarc
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery does not hold charge:I have only had this phone for a week and the battery  does not hold charge even when I hardly use it:2016-07-28:jerrybrayton
Samsung Galaxy S7:bad speaker function, seems to drop calls more than my HTC did.:Love the charger base, and the camera.:2016-07-27:rubie1989
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not worth the money:My s5 was much faster. I don't know if it's all the bloat ware,  but phone exchange runs slow .:2016-07-27:Joe7899
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not new:Can't do a lot with it get rid of some of the group apps like google,verzion and samsung.people should be able to downtown there own apps.and not be forced to have pre-installed apps:2016-07-27:squirrel man
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features,  terrible battery life:Even without playing games and just using the phone for texting, calls and music, the battery barely last through the day.:2016-07-27:Becca474
Samsung Galaxy S7:Wish I would have got a note or iphone:Seems like the same phone as my s5. Wish I could return or swap:2016-07-26:Cwildsixfour
Samsung Galaxy S7:Don't get good reception:I got this phone over a week ago wish I would have its worse than my old phone and that one wasn't the best I'm taking this one back in for a Motorola:2016-07-22:Tracesteph
Samsung Galaxy S7:Every feature costs extra. Apple Doesn't.:Every feature costs extra. Even caller ID.:2016-07-21:Pay more with Verizon
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone:It's not much difference between the 7 and 4:2016-07-20:Clesley228
Samsung Galaxy S7:Crappie phone won't switch between WiFi & 3 or 4 get without a hard reboot.:Can't wait to get rid of it.:2016-07-20:Douglas  h
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not really the best:I do not really like this phone or the features as I thought I would:2016-07-20:Brian 88
Samsung Galaxy S7:7148820441:I was happy to buy this phone but in less than a week, I already had 2 small dents on the edges of the screen.  I expect better from Samsung.  I'm very careful with my things but this is very fragile and for the price, I could of gotten another phone that was durable from another carrier.:2016-07-20:1MVA
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not Impressed:Went from a droid maxx to S7.  So far I'm not impressed at all.  Majority of the features are not much different than the Maxx including battery life.  I thought my Maxx had a lot of bloat ware but this phone is crazy loaded with tons of bloat ware.  Maybe a lot of the features I don't care for is more of a learning curve of using this phone but there are a lot of features that require extra touches to get to the same place that less touches require on the Maxx.  Making calls and text messages require additional touches which is sad considering it's the major functions that I use for these devices.  The other thing I notices is the signal strength is significantly weaker than the Maxx.  I haven't fully tested the signal but certain places in my house I loose connectivity and never had that problem with the Maxx.  Unfortunately you are only provided 14 days before you can return the device.  I have since past that time period but at first opportunity I plan on returning to the Motorola phone.  I've had those for at least 6 years and enjoyed them.  The only reason I tried the Samsung was all the hype these phones were getting so I thought I'd try it out.:2016-07-19:nai0248
Samsung Galaxy S7:Terrible reception:My droid maxx was a much better phone:2016-07-19:asae1
Samsung Galaxy S7:phone:works well enough...:2016-07-19:this is ridiculous
Samsung Galaxy S7:Difficult to get my data from my Samsung Galaxy S4 to my Galaxy S7:There wasn't any documentation to make it easy to get the Galaxy S7 working.  Also, there are so many applications that I have know idea if they are needed or not.  I still can't get photos imported into my Windows 10 computer.  Overall, it is a decent phone, but it took a long time to figure out the new phone.:2016-07-18:F777
Samsung Galaxy S7:Over-rated:I've had this phone for a few weeks now. There are positives and negatives. For the good, it's very simple to learn and use. The interface is fast acting. And the camera is very sharp & clear as well. Now the bad - I have had a few glitches with it already; for instance, sometimes the screen doesn't accurately respond to where I touch (i.e. keyboard or Internet surfing). It also loves to randomly pause in the middle of a song when I'm listening to the music player. Just the other day, the flashlight app drained my battery even though it wasn't open. I had to force close the app 3 times before the phone actually accepted my command. Finally, the auto-correct is really annoying. It's choice of words to correct to are so off the wall, it's like somebody programmed it to be ridiculous.:2016-07-17:Jols
Samsung Galaxy S7:I want my S5 Back:I bought the S7 about a week ago and have had many, many problems since I bought it.  I've been back to the store 3 times to resolve problems and still have things that don't seem to be working.  I want my S5 back!!!:2016-07-17:dbsm
Samsung Galaxy S7:Runs  out of battery quick.:The phone is not  as good as they advertise,  he Camara is better that my old Motorola  ,  but for my utilities  for me is better Motorola.:2016-07-17:Hunter789
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy S7:I read that the battery was much better on the S7 than the S6 and I am finding that not to be true.I am very dissappointed with the battery life.:2016-07-16:CRaz7
Samsung Galaxy S7:So slow:Unable to do anything with this runs slow:2016-07-16:Dnavarrete
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointed in workmanship of phone.:5 days after having phone I had dropped it accidentally( at max) a foot from floor and screen cracked all over. Of course making phone non water resistant. Warranty you get from Samsung with phone doesn't cover.   As far as the features, using and navigation is great. I really enjoy new apps and camera options and settings.   Highly suggest case and screen protector right away. Phone is very slick and slips out places very easily.:2016-07-14:Linzo78
Samsung Galaxy S7:It is okay:Similar to the Samsung S5.:2016-07-11:Mtifft27
Samsung Galaxy S7:difficulties in setting up phone:The phone has been more difficult to set up than the motorola phones I have previously owned, my personal email is still not working yet:2016-07-10:davefromboone
Samsung Galaxy S7:Won't stay connected to Wifi:2 weeks so far and all 4 phone have troubles staying connected to Wifi. Our old phones never had this problem.  Battery life is weak at best.:2016-07-10:Cohoking
Samsung Galaxy S7:My personal thought:Honestly I used to be with Verizon for years when I was on the family plan. But now that I have a single plan, I am pretty disappointed . First off purchasing the galaxy s7 , I expected it to have much more new features but comparing it to an old galaxy note2 I actually miss it. I guess what I am feeling is, I favor Verizon, the galaxy s7 is a good phone, I believe tough it is a bit over priced and all the extra charges Verizon is doing now is killing the excitement of purchasing a new phone.:2016-07-10:Marina hassaballa
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointed:"Very disappointed in the durability of this phone. My previous phone had a ""gorilla glass"" screen and Kevlar backing, so it was very durable. I expected the same from the Samsung Galaxy S7. The case on this phone is very slippery, so I could see the need for a case to protect it. Unfortunately I wasn't quick enough with that purchase. After less than a week, the phone slipped out of my hand while removing it from my pocket. Of course the screen cracked on impact. I would expect a phone to be durable enough to withstand a fall from less than 30 inches. I guess looks are more important.":2016-07-09:Disappointed in S7
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7:Battery life very short..antenna coverage area not nearly as good as Droid turbo:2016-07-06:Jholmes42
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not good for me:Visually impaired users will have a very difficult time with this phone.  Not enough contrast between print and background, print is way too small.  Fix those problems and it will be a great phone.:2016-07-05:truckerLarry
Samsung Galaxy S7:OK but some of the apps don't work:For this being a brand new phone that is meant to have a number of great features, there are some basic qualities of it that are not up to par. For example, the battery drains like crazy unless you make A LOT of a adjustments. I always have the power saving feature on, for example. This is something I have never had to do with other phones. Another quality I do not like is I cannot get spotify or Overdrive apps to work properly. Spotify will not play two songs in a row, I have to pick each song manually. Overdrive will not download an entire ebook at once. I have never had these issues before with other devices. These are just main issues I have found in a mere week.:2016-07-05:joy823
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not happy:Photo did not down load:2016-07-04:Pa6566
Samsung Galaxy S7:S5 is better #disappointed:There is no border/edge on the S7. When I hold the side of the phone, I accidentally press numbers or letters. This causes frustration when texting while holding the phone or using the keypad when on a call. There are not many upgrades that I notice, with the exception of the camera, when compared to the S5. The only positive is if logged into Samsung, all apps, numbers, photos, messages, etc... transfer. Prices are better at competitors with included accessories when compared to purchasing through Verizon.:2016-07-03:Rescue dog mom
Samsung Galaxy S7:Same features as other phone.:Not happy with battery life, does not last a day.:2016-07-03:hazel14
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy G6:Dosen't ring. Rings too softly. Loses contacts.  Great camera. Does not hold a charge very long.:2016-07-01:Nucls
Samsung Galaxy S7:Worst Phone I have ever owned:Battery life will not last more than 5 hours. Iphone battery life is better that galaxy s7. Only had this phone for about 10 days.:2016-06-30:Gatorwife
Samsung Galaxy S7:The reception is terrible:I bought this phone a month ago...I love all the features that the phone is equipped with. My problem is that I have no service any where I go. I don't know if it's the device or Verizon itself. It's frustrating to switch to a network that prides themselves on service then to switch to that network to have dropped calls and unable to send text messages.:2016-06-30:Laceymariexo
Samsung Galaxy S7:Poorer service than iphone5s:Lots of dropped calls, have problems connecting to Internet especially using phone as hot spot for other devices,  when talking the person I'm talking to often can't hear me unless I put speaker on.:2016-06-30:Moron
Samsung Galaxy S7:My Galaxy S7:I bought it over two weeks ago to replace my Galaxy III.:2016-06-29:pdagain
Samsung Galaxy S7:Aggravated with this phone and purchase:I purchased this phone 1 week ago because I was going on a vacation. I was needing something to keep me entertained on the long plane ride and something to take photos and videos with. My older HTC was having issues charging and holding charge. The particular store I stopped into didn't have the HTC 10 in stock, so I opted to get the Samsung S7.   It took a few days to get used to the switch from HTC to Samsung, but I ended up liking a lot of the features on the S7 (the fingerprint scanner, the clarity of voice calls, the screen clarity.)   A few days after my S7 purchase, I arrived at my vacation destination. I stayed entertained by listening to about 5 hours of podcasts I had downloaded, and I remember being impressed at how little battery life I had used. I attribute some of this to the S7 and some of this to the fact that I was running in airplane mode.    This part is where I'm really frustrated-- One day after I reach my destination, the charging port on my S7 quit working. I couldn't take photos of **anything**!  I was also stuck for a very long, boring flight back to the US.  The whole reason I bought a new phone was because my older phone wasn't charging and I wanted something to use to take photos and keep me entertained on this vacation!  The S7 is failing me here and I haven't even had it for a week yet!  This was a really special family vacation for me. We were celebrating an immediate relative recently receiving his masters degree and his recent marriage. We also had a terminally ill immediate relative come along with us, with the likelihood that this will be his last vacation like this and our last vacation as our complete family. I came away from this vacation with only about 4 photos.  Because of this, I will always be bitter about this S7 purchase.  And to make matters worse, while I had it plugged in, hoping it would charge, I dropped it off of my nightstand.  The screen ended up cracking despite the fact I had purchased the UAG brand protective case to prevent this exact type of thing from happening, so I'm obviously also questioning the durabilty of this phone. Since the screen is cracked, I'll have to use an insurance claim and pay the deductible in order to have it replaced.   I am extremely aggravated with this whole purchase. In hindsight, I wish I would've picked any other phone except this one.:2016-06-27:phife
Samsung Galaxy S7:Reception was not as good as my old s5:"I am very happy with some of the new features but also disappointed with having to have the location turned on to get the blue  tooth to work. The reception on the s7 is not as good as the older s5. In places where the new one breaks up I didn't even know there was a weak signal with the s5. They also removed the the ir sensor. :(":2016-06-24:Jayrussell7
Samsung Galaxy S7:Extremely difficult to figure out:I bought this phone a few days ago. I don't like it. It's very difficult to figure out how to use.  All the keys are too small for my fingers, and the users manual is so small I can't read it without a magnifying glass. Also, the picture of the keys in the manual doesn't match my phone. Haven't yet figured out how to text my contacts without having to retype their phone numbers.  Have yet to fins anything I like about. Wish I hadn't bought it.:2016-06-23:Jimvan5
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not so great...not an easy transfer:I upgraded from an LG and regret it.  The Galaxy S7 is less than impressive:2016-06-22:NeverShouldHaveDoneIt
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not a good start:Bought 2 the same day, one for me and my fiancé, hers has been nothing but trouble getting set up, the newest update is buggy and at times inconsistent.  With the curved screen the new glass coverings do not sit well and the edge of the screen does not respond well and you cannot change the touch sensitivity which needs done with the glass protectors.:2016-06-21:Speirs
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7 should not be recommended for Note 4 replacement:Even though it's android a lot of the system workings are not the same.  I can't even save a text.  The processor is much slower, watching video is painstaking.  It catalogs newest photos to the bottom of the page for some reason....and so on and so on.  I want my note back!:2016-06-21:BSigg
Samsung Galaxy S7:Finally making me consider a switch to Apple:"I've had this S7 for almost a month now and really regret my ""upgrade"". The screen's nice and the body is easy to hold, otherwise nothing is quite right. Not horrible, just nothing is particularly intuitive and many of the features get in my way and I spend half my time fixing commands that I didn't intend. It gets frustrating  after a while and just hasn't gotten any better.":2016-06-21:Unhappy with S7
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very Disappointed:I was very excited about getting this phone and wow what a disappointment. My last smart phone was hands down better. Battery life is poor and it has less features. Do your homework before you but this!:2016-06-21:Curts123
Samsung Galaxy S7:I get terrible service with this phone!!:I wish I could get better service.  I miss calls and texts.:2016-06-20:eamiller
Samsung Galaxy S7:This phone will not hold a charge:Won't hold a charge, that's why I got rid of the last one:2016-06-20:Wlstewart
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very unhappy with signal strength:I had a galaxie s3 prior to this s7 & that phone worked better. I get no signal at work, my side shop & my cabin in poconos. My friends tmobile phone works great..:2016-06-19:Paintguy74
Samsung Galaxy S7:OK shuts down for no reason:It's ok nothing different to me than the s5:2016-06-17:Bks1324
Samsung Galaxy S7:Continuous microphone problems. Phone is terrible.:Had the phone about a month. Complete battery hog. Barely makes it a day. Phone is very flimsy. Already has a crack. Owned my last phone for 3 years and it barely had a scratch. Biggest issue is the microphone that is just awful. Probably half of my calls, I have to hang up and call from a landline so people can hear. Did a Google search and learned this is a consistent problem with the Samsung phones. Only owned it a month and can't wait to get rid of it.:2016-06-16:AMS48
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy s7:"Ive had my phone activated since Sunday afternoon (June 5th) it constantly shuts off and wont turn back on. Its almost like it freezes up and shuts itself off and the only way i can get it to come back on is if i hold the volume key and the power button down for about 8-10seconds and then select reset normally. The only reason i havent called to complain is because ive had VBS at church since Sunday night and ive been working long hours since Sunday. I will be visiting a Verizon Store VERY soon to see about getting  a new one. Im not happy with this especially since its a ""new phone"" and the money i had to pay for it.  If you would like to contact me about this please feel free to call me.  Thank you":2016-06-16:Ashful
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy 7:I think this phone might be a little more than I need.  I definitely think it's a beautiful phone, but twice now, I have made costly mistakes, because I haven't had time to learn it.  I was aggravated last night, because someone was calling me, and I couldn't answer the phone.:2016-06-16:Carpentersfem
Samsung Galaxy S7:Seemed to be too easy to be real transferring things over to new phone. It was.:I am disappointed that the battery is no better than my S6.  When the tech at the phone store used the app to transfer everything to my new phone, none of my Verizon contacts or my calendar was transferred to the new phone.. Not worth upgrading.:2016-06-15:apatge
Samsung Galaxy S7:9893237632:I bought it this 2 or 3 weeks ago and it seemed a bit slow texting. I have to press a little harder than I'm used to to text. Also I keep havingredients problems sending messages. Sometimes they just keep pending and won't sent. Not sure what the problem is but it is deff a little worse than my s5:2016-06-15:Sued1211
Samsung Galaxy S7:Bad Battery and no support for Arabic language:I disappointed when I see the Arabic language not supported. Also, talked to Samsung customer support and they confirmed no way to install Arabic. The battery live is not that good comparing to the Chinese Phones.:2016-06-14:Migo
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not as good as my LG:This phone may be waterproof but, I miss my voice announcement of text msgs, do not disturb is a joke. It just does not do what the LG did. Think I will trade it in.:2016-06-14:cav817
Samsung Galaxy S7:Horrible battery:Doesn't hold a charge. I might as well have a landline.:2016-06-14:Jonim78
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice phone, BUT, TERRIBLE BATTERY LIFE!:This phone has a terribly short battery life, I use phone only 3-4 times per day, do not use very many apps, after 6-8 hours, battery needs charged. Had an S5, battery lasted way longer:2016-06-13:NRAmemeber
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not what I expected. I should have kept my Note3:I bought this phone a couple of weeks ago. Not happy,but it will have to do for now.:2016-06-13:Bosslady50
Samsung Galaxy S7:Meh, not that impressed:Cool phone but doesn't do some of the things my s4 did, things i used many times a day:2016-06-13:Ken2999
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not what I expected:Bought 1 week ago.  Phone crashes at least once a day. Have to hard reboot. Apps did not download,  missed about half of them.:2016-06-13:MarieLaveau
Samsung Galaxy S7:nice phone but has problems:Nice phone and camera but doesn't work consistently .  Gives a notice that the sim card is missing .   Remove it,  put it back in and the thing works great  until you get another message that there is no  sim card.   Happens about  every two days.  Traveling and have to stop and reinstall the sim card so it will work again.:2016-06-10:Unhappy Samsung Owner
Samsung Galaxy S7:Why bother:Too complicated - no instructions - don't know how to use it.:2016-06-10:Whybotheragain
Samsung Galaxy S7:No real improvements from the S5:I wish I would have reviewed other phones.:2016-06-10:Matthew1506
Samsung Galaxy S7:Still not sure:I bought this phone about 2 weeks ago; my first SmartPhone.  It is taking some getting used to but my biggest complaint is the battery needs to be charge every two days and voicemail can't be heard without using data.:2016-06-10:Sandime
Samsung Galaxy S7:Overall not a bad phone:I've had this phone for a few months, easy set up, I like the quick charge feature. but the actual phone reception is not that great, with my Samsung SG3mini I had great reception from work all the way home, with this one I get spotty reception where the person I'm talking tells me I sound like I'm under water... or can't hear me at all. also I could sit in my living room with my old phone or walk out to the sidewalk in front of my house and stay connected to my wifi...with this phone I lose my wifi reception sitting on my couch and there is no way I'm keeping it to the sidewalk in front of my house...pictures look great phone work great other than that:2016-06-10:whitepicket
Samsung Galaxy S7:Some problems:When ever I play my favorite game on the S7 it will close out my game for no reason a lot and also it has some lag when it comes to the phone over all:2016-06-09:Melanie04
Samsung Galaxy S7:It was ok:I keep having my calls break up. Even my voice mail. I have the  trial view VM feature where I can read the VM.  That is not good because the Voice breaks up. This is very frustrating. I even have to disconnect my blue tooth and turn on the Speaker to try to have some conversions.  I have even had to use my husbands phone to have a conversation.  This is very bad for my business. If I had not had Verizon service for 19 years I would think it is the service. I know it is not because my husband has Verizon as long as I have. My phone uses battery very quickly.  I have turned off the features such as Blue tooth and Wi Fi when I am not using them  There are features on the phone that I love. If I don't get the problems resolved I will be going back to my Apple IPhone:2016-06-09:dogwood1948
Samsung Galaxy S7:Wish I had my S5 back:I liked my Galaxy S5 quite a bit but I needed an upgrade due to battery life and memory so I chose the S7.  I have not been able to successfully have a phone call on the device.  No one can hear me.  Also now I have all of these useless S5 charging cables.  Also the S7 seems to get hotter than the S5 did.  And why did they make it with only 32GB?  Also it seems slower loading web pages than my S5 was.  Disappointed.:2016-06-08:coloradoverizoncustomer
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung 7:This phone doesn't stay charged...gets hot often:2016-06-07:Thmcgee
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery:I have never had a battery that pretty much could not last all day. Really unhappy with this phone. My last Galaxy I could go 2 days. This one I pretty much can't go 12 hours. I should have gone with the iPhone 6s like all my friends told me too:2016-06-06:Pj59
Samsung Galaxy S7:Tough transition:I down loaded the manual. It was a lot of help but still did not answer all the questions.:2016-06-05:Snders
Samsung Galaxy S7:Short battery life:Had the phone for a week and the battery doesn't last very long.:2016-06-04:Vduncan
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone is good:I bought this a week ago. Battery is really bad and it dries out very early.:2016-06-03:Kgupta
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery:Bought this a few weeks ago and after a few text messages with out being hooked up the battery life goes down quickly, my Droid, I could text most of the day and it might have gone down to 60 to 50  percent left after being off charger. And if you do not restrict background even when connected to wifi it will eat up your data.:2016-06-03:racad
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's ok:When I bought this phone it worked ok. The longer I have it the more issues are arising. It randomly restarts, the screen goes black for no reason. It definitely has some glitches that need to be worked out. Overall it is easy to use and the camera quality is amazing!:2016-06-02:ajrenny
Samsung Galaxy S7:My S5 was so much better:I bought this a month ago and am amazed at how samsung took a great product and ruined it.  Many things I could do on my old phone in 1 screen tap now take 3-5, the floating toolbox is no more, no more replaceable battery, new battery lasts 1/2 as long as the one on my s5 did with much less usage, and worst of all the connectivity is spotty at best.  Calls get dropped, places where I always had network connectivity in the past are deadzones, page loads are slower and freezes more frequent.  Yesterday my wife almost started calling hospitals because she didnt hear from me following a long run (her texts, along with 10 other very important messages never came in until I shutdown and rebooted my phone once I got home).  The onscreen aesthetics are not as good either.  The screen has to be turned up to atleast halfway unless you are in a really dark setting or you cant see any text at all.  The icons make it feel like a toy phone I would give my 2 year old.  VERY DISAPPOINTED and hope to be in to a store today to try and get out of the 2 years worth of payments I will be stuck with on a phone that I am struggling to tolerate:2016-06-02:enrique perlozzo
Samsung Galaxy S7:Alright:Had the phone for only 3days. The screen cracked. How to fix it. Send it in to galaxy takes 2 months and I would have to pay for it,  even if you get insurance there's a deductible:2016-05-31:Kmb1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Blah...:"I have had the phone for a week. Was told this would fix all the issues I hated with my S5... it doesn't. As far as I can see it really only has more memory and a better battery. Other than that it's as bad as any other Samsung. No integration of operating system (which just is getting closer and closer to apple OS) and the phone, so i ha e had to reinstall apps and restart the phone nearly daily because something else crashes. Don't be fooled by the haphazard ""benefits"", just buy the apple.":2016-05-30:ELN5
Samsung Galaxy S7:nice camera, otherwise not that impressive:"When I got an S3, it was a big change over the HTC I had. Then an S5 and it was not really much different. With the S7, the camera is greatly improved in speed and the pictures are quite good.  But, many operations now take extra taps and some features that I was used to are missing. I don't know if this is Google's, Samsung's, or Verizon's doing, but I don't like it.  The battery life is not impressive. Calculating back from the info on the battery status page it seems the phone sometimes thinks the battery capacity is less than 1000 mAh instead of the ""actual"" 3000. On the other hand, some days it does work well.  The phone restarts by itself. I see that this is fairly common complaint. I also get random changes of settings. The display of battery % gets turned off and my lock screen display changes to the default. The always on display is off, even though the setting is ""on"".  I would have given it a 3 or 3.5 star rating based on the camera performance, but the battery and general flakiness take it down to a 2.":2016-05-30:kylejohn
Samsung Galaxy S7:Prefer the note 5:I bought this 8 days ago and will more than likely exchange the S7 for the Note 5:2016-05-29:Deb3556
Samsung Galaxy S7:verizon company is good. but device is expensive:The battery is wearing out too quickly. I didn't get a secondary battery.:2016-05-26:j 1234
Samsung Galaxy S7:The speaker phone is not as high quality for the people I am calling, disapointed.:The features are good and the phone is fast but the quality of the speaker feedback is sub-par:2016-05-26:pjsmithii
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung S7:I never would have upgraded if I knew I would have so many issues.:2016-05-26:Leaseman
Samsung Galaxy S7:Terrible keyboard touch sensitivity. Bad Bluetooth:The screen sensitivity is not adjustable. I purchased an Otter case which would not work with the phone. You had to bang on the keys to get it to register. Had an S4 that Otter case worked great on. Had to take case back. Got a case that has protector placed on screen directly. Phone is better but keyboard is still not sensitive enough. Tried using Swift Key app but the keyboard is worst and now using Samsung keyboard again. THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED. Screen keyboard sensitivity needs to be user adjustable. Do not like the headphone jack on the bottom of the phone. Bluetooth to a Cubix stereo speaker has static and will not work properly. That is unacceptable! S4 works properly with same speaker. Can not understand how this phone went through any Samsung system test facility and passed.:2016-05-25:broadws
Samsung Galaxy S7:I don't like this phone at all, my S5 was so much better:I wished I'd have kept my S5:2016-05-25:Karla1975
Samsung Galaxy S7:I have had a few Issues:Right now I am not so sure how I like this phone, I am having more issues with it then I did with my Note 4 that I traded in.:2016-05-24:Fan4Life46
Samsung Galaxy S7:"Not the easiest phone to transfer too.... :-(":I love Samsung's, my favorite phones all time. But I have lost some features from my old Samsung and it is making me sad. I have had some issues with finding features and found out it cannot be done on this phone.:2016-05-24:Squishy21
Samsung Galaxy S7:New 7 vs. My old 5:My new phone seems to be MUCH slower, Web pages do not load automatically, battery drains very quickly.  Disappointed to see that major changes were not made in bettering the camera.  Doesn't feel like much of a difference from my Galaxy S5.:2016-05-23:jclark5
Samsung Galaxy S7:Difficult to use:The combo deal was great, but the phone itself is difficult to use.  Wish I could get back to my Note series.  Think I need to go to the classes to get more out of the phone.:2016-05-22:CShido
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good features but not satisfied:I bought my phone about a week ago and this is the second phone I got but it gets hot to often. I don't like that. I turned the first one in because it got hot and now this one does too.:2016-05-19:Ajjdwxs2
Samsung Galaxy S7:Quality phone – but the OS kills it:"I originally switched over to this phone because I was trying to switch carriers, and Verizon was out of stock on the iPhone SE. Although I have always preferred Apple products, I figured that Android must have come a long way since I last used their OS in 2012, and decided that Samsung's Galaxy S7 would be my best bet (if I wanted the best Android had to offer). The phone itself is gorgeous, and Samsung did a really nice job with the overall feel and aesthetic of the phone. I was so excited about it, until I actually got my hands on it and poked around in the OS. I mean, seriously, you'd think after all this time that Android would learn something, but at the end of the day, the OS feels just the same as it did four years ago: Bloated and slow. Android fans boasted to me about how Samsung's new flagship has better specs than my iPhone 6s, with its new processor and expandable storage – all those wonderful things. I was really genuinely excited about the switch over, thinking I'd run into this blazing fast, wonderful piece of art. I couldn't have been more wrong. My hat is off to Samsung for attempting to make a great phone, but shame on Android for being such a slow pile of garbage. If you're on the verge of switching (if you're an iPhone user) for any of the reasons I stated above (better processor/more RAM/more storage), but you even remotely like iOS, DO NOT switch. It will be nothing but instant regret.  I am going back today to return the phone and get another iPhone 6s.":2016-05-19:Saviorslim
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone service:I bought this phone less then two weeks and I do not like it at all. Calls keeping getting dropped. Service is poor. I can't believe I chose this phone thinking it would be better. So unhappy. Even downloading the usual apps and they freeze up and stop responding. No I am not in the country I am in the same area as I have always been with my other phone and have gotten better service. All with Verizon but different phones. This phone just not making it:2016-05-19:DALFINGRL
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery not holding charge much longer than old S3:with everything not active and no texting and no calls, the battery is mostly gone within 24 hours:2016-05-18:bungus
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great if you want to use it for anything other than calls:Got this for mothers day and it doesn't get more than 1 bar of signal most days. Took it to the store contacted Samsung no one knows why. Never dropped a call ever with my s4 upgraded and can't hold a conversation. Everything else about it is nice:2016-05-17:Melissa12345u
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung S7 The good, bad, & bottom line:"Review period about 1 week THE GOOD Video calling , Samsung S Health, custom sound for your ears only; where you can set the phone to your hearing capabilities & sounds awesome! Resolution of screen & colors, Awesome!  THE BAD Like the phone and some featured/apps but man does this thing heat up. Being in Arizona doesn't help any either. Have to drill down all the apps, power save mode, battery usage optimized. Screen brightness to at least be able to use the phone & have it go the entire day.  ADDITIONAL ACCESSORIES: Haven't gotten the VR headset yet but have tried it out in Best Buy. Pretty cool Watch, for all the S health & related apps, though not into having something like that touch my skin all the time. Radio waves ie SAR Kind of allergic to Bluetooth, nasty migraines...  BOTTOM LINE Not a bad phone, but due to the heat issues, battery life, and trying to figure out what app is taking up all the juice on this thing is a little much for me. Shouldn't have to figure out what apps causing my phone to be constantly running in the background... Best advise ; look up complaints online to verify you can deal with any purchase you decide. Going to Bestbuy to see if someone from Samsung can help me figure this out app issue or possibly phone issue out.. My next purchase will depend on the outcome of the above...":2016-05-17:AlleyCat13
Samsung Galaxy S7:Slight upgrade:Screen too sensitive to any touch even with fingers used to hold the phone. Battery life horrible even after changing settings:2016-05-17:Verizon819
Samsung Galaxy S7:TERRIBLE BATTERY LIFE:Had phone for a week and the battery dies faster than my 2 year old s5. Only complaint with the phone.:2016-05-17:NOS7
Samsung Galaxy S7:No fm radio:I had this phone for a week and really liked it. Then I tried to use next radio app that allows free FM radio, but I found out Verizon disabled the installed chip so you can't use it. I returned the phone and am considering switching carriers.:2016-05-15:1000squared
Samsung Galaxy S7:Slow compare to the iPhone 6:I got this phone a week ago and it's so slow:2016-05-15:Michael8848
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7 is not what they claim it to be!!!!!:I have had my Galaxy S7 for just over a week now and am VERY disappointed! I previously had the S5 and liked it very much except for the battery life. Thinking that the S7 would be an improvement was a mistake on my part. I have absolutely no signal at my home in Northern New Mexico and limited to spotty even in town. I have to turn it on Airplane mode and the turn it off again to reset the signal. I give it a two only because it's a very pretty phone and takes great pictures, but looks aren't everything and I own a camera so that doesn't leave much for the phone.:2016-05-14:No Signal
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not thrilled with new phone, not as great as you make it out to be:Not really happy with phone:2016-05-14:LucyRickie
Samsung Galaxy S7:Do not like at all:Not happy at all!!! But unfortunately stuck with it.:2016-05-13:tgouldus4
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7 gorilla glass is worthless:I watched a friend of mine who has the same phone drop it on accident 2 inches onto a desk and his screen shattered. I just dropped mine today from about 4 inches and the same thing. This is the fist time I have ever witnessed such a worthless screen. I had dropped my old phone before numerous times on different surfaces and never once got a nick.:2016-05-13:Raol
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone functionality is really nice but....:"The design engineers are behind the 8 ball. Two quick drawbacks: 1) most folks hold the phone in their hand and usually place their pinky under the phone to prevent is slipping out. the microphone is in the way so you may be talking but no one will hear you. Microphone is in the wrong spot at the bottom of the phone. 2) the new glass cover that you but as an option to prevent cracking the phone when is slips from your hand is great. But the cover exceeds the boundary by a bit. This causes an issue when typing because the glass cover get in the way causing you to go somewhere that you did not attend. As a result you need to cautious about typing when you have the glass cover. Note: other than that, the functionality although different from what you had, is very good.":2016-05-10:Lou M
Samsung Galaxy S7:Really disappointed in this phone:I finally transitioned from Blackberry to an Android. Granted, I've kept an open mind, but this phone has a mind of it's own. It lacks some basic essentials, and some features are far more complicated than necessary. This biggest peeve has been that I have had it less than one week, and it has frozen to the point of a hard reset 3x. Ridiculous.:2016-05-09:unclemattyz
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not happy:I switched from an iphone, not thrilled with the way the Galaxy S7 is, I know some of it is user trying to learn a new system, but battery runs low fast. Pictures are great!!:2016-05-09:Cheryl3518
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great features!:Love my new phone! It's everything I hoped for and then some!:2016-05-08:DLGB
Samsung Galaxy S7:So far, my Samsung 4 worked better and I felt more reliable:The sensitivity is really bad. Rarely can I get it to turn on consistently. I have had no luck yet and that is with two trips to the store to get my music on my phone. My computer never recognizes the phone for access. The light really flushes out the screen I have to go to the shade or dark places to see it, especially with the camera. One reason for getting it was battery life but it is dead within 12 - 14 hours.:2016-05-08:cinron1880
Samsung Galaxy S7:Unimpressive:"1. S7 couldn't read photos fm external SD card. 2. ""Favorites"" in phone not in alphabetical order! Random; extremely annoying! 3. Email messages don't delete with a swipe. 4. Have to swipe before you get to lock screen, instead of just opening to lock screen, an extra step. 5. I think there are other annoying features; I just can't remember them all. Perhaps these annoying features could be changed if I knew how to find them in the phone. I don't; I'm techno- challenged. I didn't upgrade for fancy new features. I upgraded from my old Galaxy because the camera wore out. Those of us who are techno-challenged just want a ""smart phone"" that's dumb enough for us, & reliable.":2016-05-06:Unimpressed160373
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery SUCKS:My standby time with my BRAND new S7 is about 8 hours, and usage is about 2 hours. There is something seriously wrong here, and I can't get to the bottom of it. Battery SUCKS!!!!! Charge to 100%, then I just leave it off for a few hours. When I go to use the phone, the charge is now at 91%. Nothing running. I have EVERY option and app OFF. Even installed new launcher, keep all apps and utilities closed. Still the battery wears down fast. What's the sense of having all these features if I can't use them unless I'm constantly plugged in????:2016-05-01:Teressina
Samsung Galaxy S7:i should have gone with the droid turbo like i wanted originally...:biggest gripe is the trash battery life and unwillingness to cooperate when i hit force stop and disable on an app, i dont expec t to see 15 of them up and running again in 10 min. my droid maxx smoked this thing for overall ease of use and the battery by leaps and bounds, by like 40+ hours... the only thing this phone has better is the camera and thats only marginal... if i werent past the return window to get rid of this thing i would in a heartbeat and go with the turbo or stick with my maxx, but would in no way get another galaxy...:2016-05-01:TattedWeb
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not as good as my S5...:I've had this phone almost two weeks now. It's not bad, the battery life isn't as good as my S5 was but it still lasts about a day.The camera is also good. The biggest flaw with this phone is the SD card tray. It is always moving around thinking that I keep putting in a new card when its in my pocket. So every hour or so I get an SD card notification asking if I want to manage contents or eject the card. This is very annoying!! Almost to the point I may consider getting a different phone. I formatted the SD card, taped it to stop moving, no help at all. I did a factory reset and it seemed to solve the problem until the next time my phone died, now its doing it again. I'm not going to reset my phone every time it dies. This needs to be fixed in the later models. The S5 was the best phone I've had and I'm fairly disappointed with this hiccup. Other than that it's a nice phone.:2016-04-29:dc1944
Samsung Galaxy S7:A little disappointing:I had high hopes for this phone as I could not wait to get rid of my Droid Turbo. The S7 battery life is not good at all. I find myself always reaching for the charger. The screen is very touchy and tends to jump around. The other day I sent two texts I didn't know I sent! Something about going to a party? Overall, I can't help but be a little disappointed in the phone. I was expecting more and frankly, it undelivered. I will say the camera is excellent.:2016-04-28:The G Man
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7:The phone is overly sensitive, which leads to it opening items that you are not using. If your a YouTube or Video user, the phone opens repeat the next video before you even finished the current video. Various Keys and applications are often non-responsive. This was an upgrade from the S5 that I loved. Given the price I expected more from this phone and would not purchase it again.:2016-04-25:LaLaCam
Samsung Galaxy S7:Miss S5:1. Battery life still an issue wireless charging is nice when it works. 2. No IR Blaster in S7 so cant use phone as remote like I could with S5 3. Phone still overheats Same as S5. 4. Miss the ability to change battery when needed:2016-04-25:Jon T
Samsung Galaxy S7:Sorry I Traded My Old Phone:This phone has no adjustment for touch sensitivity. It feels like you have to push very hard for your touch to register. Also, the battery life is terrible! You can almost watch as the battery life drains quickly away.:2016-04-22:bmbell
Samsung Galaxy S7:Best phone ever expect for battery life:Excellent phone expect for poor battery life:2016-04-20:Exectioner
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery and usability are lacking:Upgraded to a new phone. (first brand new phone in about 5 years) In the past I have purchased used and refurbished phones. Please keep in mind that I use my phone for business. By the end of the day the battery life is really not measurably better than my old phone (Droid X). Personally, I don't like the fact I can not find a way to highlight unread text messages which is important to me for business. Also, alerts for email and text messages are not erased after I open them to see what has come in. This means that I have to manually clear these alerts which, is a hassle when you send messages/receive emails multiple times throughout the day. The camera is great I will give it that. The plastic screen protector that came with my phone is not as big as the screen which, obstructs visibility on the screen. Storage on the device is limited which, I plan to expand with another sim card. I have also experienced problems moving photos from my phone to my PC manually and had to resort to emailing them to myself which would not be an issue if there werent many images. But, moving 50+ photos can be a huge hassel.:2016-04-18:carsondiego
Samsung Galaxy S7:UGH:I was so excited to get this phone, but I'm thoroughly disappointed. It constantly crashes especially when on wifi, has problems charging, and is just a pain to work with. I would think it was just my phone being glitchy, but my husband has the same phone and he has the same issue:2016-04-18:nicbor
Samsung Galaxy S7:I returned mine. Not responding to my touch:I wish the phone worked like it should. i really liked the phone but i had issues with dropped calls and the keyboard not registering to my touch. I took one back and got a new one thought maybe i just got a bad phone but I had the same problems on the next one. I returned the phone all together and just went back to my GS5. I never had any issues with that phone. I really liked the s7 i just wish it didnt have so many bugs:2016-04-13:SZu9
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy S7:I liked the phone very much, but it did not have the capacity to receive a strong enough signal at my home or work to use it. Even with an external antenna, the problem remained. We returned them, and I still have my Apple 5c:2016-04-13:debra8366
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not so good battery life:Over an 8 hour period with my phone sitting in my car on airplane mode the battery life would drain to less than 50%. My old S5 would be near 80%. I factory reset the phone and it is much better in airplane mode. Unfortunately when I actually use the phone the battery life is still rather bad.  All the other great feature like samsung pay, awesome camera, water proof, SD card go out the window if your battery is dead.:2016-04-09:BigAl77
Samsung Galaxy S7:iHeartRadio crashes phone, corrupts settings.:Upgraded from S5. Love the Galaxy phones. This is my second S7 in 2 weeks because the iHeartRadio app within minutes causes the whole phone to reboot. This wouldn't be too bothersome if also, within days, the WiFi and hardware buttons didn't also stop working. Only factory reset fixes it. 2 phones, separate phones, same problem.:2016-04-07:SamRueby
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone in concept.....if it worked:I loved the phone and if it would work consistently, it would be awesome. I'm not be sarcastic, it really was a great phone, but I've had significant problems since week 2 of ownership. Verizon did their best to help (as they always do), so they sent some signals through the air and it worked better for a couple days. But in the past week, it took on more and more problems and yesterday if shutdown and now I have to replace it. The good news is that I fully expect Verizon will work this out as they have done for the past 21 years I've been with them. Great phone company. Not a great phone, in the end.:2016-04-06:Ggg2632
Samsung Galaxy S7:Mixed feelings:From day one of buying this Phone I can almost watch the countdown of the battery draining away, standard text keyboard sucks,auto correct is terrible. On the plus side it is faster then my galaxy 4 but the battery life is way better on my G4. Disappointing as its supposed to have good battery life.:2016-04-04:Jerico95621
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy S7:This phone is horrible. My Note3 was a better device. The battery does not last long at all. Will be returning to store.:2016-04-04:Arch333
Samsung Galaxy S7:battery:I bought 4 phones 2 weeks ago and all 4 phones have to have the battery recharged daily. the standby time on them is only about 30 hours and if you use them at all you have to charge them after about 16 hours.:2016-04-04:Jim19591959
Samsung Galaxy S7:Upgraded from a Samsung 5 to a 7 and not too happy. Too many options not on 7.:"Email is missing the following: No Outbox, No Spam, No Junk, No Cell Back, No Option to build Subfolders to Save emails, No Circle with arrow to click to speed up moving emails from Server to Cell, No Text Message option. An App is required to transfer photos from Cell to Laptop - cables will no longer work. Refers you to an app for Wi-Fi transfer -- not what I wanted.":2016-04-03:ATMC
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice Features, poor app compatibilty:The on-board features of the phone are great. Touch screen is responsive, phone is beautiful, and camera is the best I've ever had. Battery life is average at best. Biggest issue with the phone is that many apps do not work well with it. Most of my streaming apps such as Spotify will pause frequently for no reason. This isn't an internet issue, as the Galaxy S5 streams just fine on the same services. Also I've noticed the compass feature doesn't work with certain apps. Hopefully there are some updates that fix these issues, but until then I am somewhat dissatisfied with this phone since I cannot use my favorite apps anymore.:2016-04-02:BrandonGross
Samsung Galaxy S7:Too many dropped calls.:Tried it for a week, but no matter where we are (home, work, car, store) calls get dropped or the person on the other end can't hear us. Tried swapping out SIM cards, software updates, etc.... but nothing worked. Been using Verizon for many many years, and never had this problem with any of our phones.:2016-03-31:UpstateNYBill
Samsung Galaxy S7:not crazy about new phone:I upgraded from my S5 because my battery wasn't lastiing past noon. The battery in new phone is no better. I also don't like that you can't see the voice text before sending:2016-03-31:stefanief
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not what I thought it would be:This phone, although faster than the phone that it replaced, has about the same features as the previous phone The construction of the phone is a disappointment as well, in my opinion. Unfortunately, it was dropped from a distance of no more than 15 inches, fell on its back...and the glass shattered. I though this was supposed to have had some kind of Gorilla Glass.:2016-03-31:jayswt877
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not ready for primetime.:There have been two system updates in the two weeks I've had mine. At least they seem to be working on it. I'd speculate that most of the problems are with Marshmallow. No viable migration path from my Droid Razr HD. Problems with USB and WiFi to PC transfers. Incomplete User Guide. I have yet to speak with a tech support person who has been trained on the device. Let's hope it gets better.:2016-03-30:Bob L
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great processing speed, too bad there was no focus on call quality:Bought it to replace an iphone. Found this to be not too huge in a time when most phones start to look like you have a dinner plate against your face when you talk on them. The touch screen is ultra-sensitive, most of the time when I try to swipe between screens something opens. Calls seem to lose volume and drop mid conversation in places that had no coverage issues before. The phone seems to work great as soon as I call back. The battery typically can make it though the day.:2016-03-30:AZBH
Samsung Galaxy S7:Review of the Samsung S7:I switched to this phone after complaining about the horrible battery life of the S6. The S7 was suppose to have improvement on battery life. That is true but the life of the battery is still poor. I use my phone for the basics. Social media some pinterest, phone calls and email. The phone is great otherwise and I do not see any reason for the phone not to last at least a whole day. I will not be getting another samsung phone. I am done with the high priced phones that can not hold a simple charge for a whole day.:2016-03-30:Mcml
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointed:I got my S7 about a week and a half ago and I am disappointed. I am having trouble connecting to WiFi, its asking for updates, so far I have done 2, battery life is awful, I get pop ups for example to do a split screen, trouble hearing people when on the phone. Nothing what I thought it would be.:2016-03-29:Anna25
Samsung Galaxy S7:Looks great, but needs better functionality/reliability:Phone looks amazing even in a case! Camera is one of the best. Battery is ok but not up to the level of other phones available. Even with just the factory Apps (mostly disabled) and no personal Apps downloaded the phone drops by 20-25% in 12hrs of no use with power saving mode on. Battery reaches 15% after about 4.5hrs of surfing; still better than the S6. The S7 would be great if Samsung would do something about its proprietary software TouchWiz and the awful voice command software S-Voice. S-Voice has serious difficulty recognizing contacts and commands especially via Bluetooth and sometimes it freezes so not even the “wake up” command works. The phone also has random reboots and occasional glitches that require a restart to clear. Samsung did fix the WiFi issue in a recent update so no more having to turn Bluetooth off to get a stable WiFi. After having two S7 phones for the past three weeks, I love the looks of the S7 but there are more stable and reliable phones available. If Samsung would put as much detail into the software functionality and battery as they do looks, they would have the best phones of any manufacturer.:2016-03-29:Tim220
Samsung Galaxy S7:Most Expensive Paperweight Ever:I've had the phone for 11 days after my S6 went on the fritz. Since day, one the tortoise like speed of processor is extremely disappointing. While the aesthetic of a Samsung product is never disappointing, I was hoping for the speed and battery life revered by iPhone users alike. I can't help but feel let down. Bluetooth and network issues are a daily battle and I've been able to narrow it down to a hardware/software issue. This may be the first time I've been disappointed in my new Samsung. I almost wish I didn't upgrade.:2016-03-29:sunshiine413
Samsung Galaxy S7:Pain to use and set up.:If it wasn't for the Gear VR AND the 32GB device memory, I would not have purchased it. Every new phone has different locations for the same feature settings.:2016-03-29:lngrifl
Samsung Galaxy S7:Should have stuck with the iPhone:I have one game that I play pretty often and it is totally slow and lags on the s7. I have to use my old phone to play. Besides that, I had no service when I went into NYC yesterday for the longest time, even tried shutting off the wifi, but still no service and wasn't able to connect to anything. I never had that problem with my old iPhone. The battery drains pretty quickly on mine too, even though I wasn't using it that often. It does take excellent pictures though. I feel like I just bought a really expensive camera though.:2016-03-26:imperfectjenny
Samsung Galaxy S7:The Jury's Still Out For Me:"I bought this phone on March 16th - trading up from my Samsung Galaxy S3. Loved the S3 and just had not gotten around to upgrading. Finally went for the S7 and of course, the graphics are better, response time is faster and it has some cool features but.......... About 3 days after purchase I started having problems with pages loading slowly or not at all while connected to WiFi. Finally took it back to the Verizon store and they had the same problem and couldn't figure out why. They replaced the phone and the same thing happened. Everything was fine for about 3-4 days, and tonight I started having the same problem. Went online and found lots of answers on AndroidCentral Forum -- evidently I'm not the only one with this problem. For some, turning off Bluetooth while on WiFi seems to work. Others it's turning off location permission settings for certain apps, and others even have success by deleting the Dunkin Donuts App (or other such apps which utilize Bluetooth). I have tried several ""fixes"" suggested by members of the AndroidCentral forum. For me, it does seem that removing the Dunkin Donuts app and turning off Bluetooth when using WiFi seems to help -- for now. I'll have to see what it does tomorrow. I sincerely hope Samsung comes up with a fix for this soon (yes, it does seem to be a Samsung problem because S7 owners on providers OTHER than Verizon are having the same problem). I've been a loyal Android and Samsung user for many years, but if this keeps up I may have to consider Apple.":2016-03-24:schenkj
Samsung Galaxy S7:Junk:Had mine for less than a week and got rid of it. Bluetooth is a hit or miss on what it connects to and when it does it doesn't always work properly. The wifi is even worse. Would not work. I would turn it off and connect with the 4g data then turn wifi back on. For instance Pandora would not connect while on wifi. If I turned wifi off Pandora would connect. Once it did I could turn wifi back on and everything was fine. Sometimes Bluetooth would keep the Internet from working. Tried in multiple hotspots to make sure it wasn't the hotspot but it made no difference. Other then that it was a awesome phone. Great picture and fast. As being a Samsung fan I went from the S4 which I loved to the S7. The S7 has to many bugs that need to be fixed to be a good phone.:2016-03-17:Lurchjim
Samsung Galaxy S7:disappointing:"I have been waiting for this S7 to be released. I preordered and so desperately wanted to love this phone. Upgraded fron the S4. My S7 lasted 2 days, overheating numerous times and then malfunctioning. After 40 minutes of phone time with the very patient Verizon rep, I went back to exchange the phone (by recommendation of rep). 2nd S7 lasted 4 days. Overheating, although not as much as first one. I trouble shooted this to try and correct. Then I couldn't access Internet on wifi. As soon add I turned wifi off, I was able to use phone at full function. Was having issues with some of my apps, unable to open my email. On the 4th day, my phone battery was down to 30% by 230pm (taken off charger at 530am and ""normal"" use that day). Overall I got very frustrated with the phone so I returned it and reactivated my S4. I am considering an iphone vs the note 5. I'll have to research more.":2016-03-16:danielainct
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awesome phone... BUT...:I got this phone on Wednesday and I have been loving it. The camera is awesome, screen is awesome, most everything is pretty awesome. Three days in and the lock button stopped working and the volume down button stopped working.... so disappointed!!!! I also had some apps on my home screen and they all disappeared. Very frustrated.:2016-03-13:Gavmufayboyfnuf
Samsung Galaxy S7:Poor battery, not as fast as expected:I am so disappointed. I must have gotten a lemon. The battery is really poor. I'll lose 15% in an hour or moderate use. 50% loss in 4-5 hours. I know how to make sure there isn't inordinate battery drain going on, so I know it is the battery.  Also, it just isn't that fast. It isn't any faster than my Nexus 5X. Am going to return.:2016-03-13:TonyDinHOuston
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone was completely different 4months in:Phone battery would drop in <6 hours after a few months of use, even if location and wifi is turned off. Drops calls at least once a day. There is nothing fancy about this phone but it gives me a lot of problems.:2017-05-09:dlne
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not Impressed!!! Very unhappy with this phone.:I went from a Note 3 to the S7. I was very happy with the Note 3. I thought upgrading to the S7 I would be even more impressed and satisfied, but I was definitely wrong. I would not recommend this phone to any one. I have nothing positive to say about it. I would love to return to my Note 3.:2017-05-03:AJ Nelson
Samsung Galaxy S7:Buy a different phone.:The bluetooth is spotty. The battery holds little to no charge. Buy a better phone for cheaper than this garbage:2017-04-22:N94d
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointed. Not what I expected.:I had high hopes upgrading to the S7 from my Droid turbo 2. Before the Droid I had a Samsung S3. The s3 was great because it was seamless. Screen brightness, notifications, calls, texts. It all just worked and I didn't have to think about it. The Droid was fine. But it lacked the personalization and simplicity of the s3. I expected the s7 to be like the s3 only better. It definitely is not. Screen brightness is arbitrary. Sometimes blinding, sometimes dim to the point of uselessness. Some notifications can't be turned off. 7-8 times a day I get forced to attempt to sign in to a random WiFi Hotspot. Everything about this phone is mediocre sound quality, volume, reception, functionality, none of them live up to the hype. In addition to that, after the update, battery life is significantly worse. I should not have to disable or restrict functions to get battery life similar to how it was pre-update. The s7 is not the discreet companion the s3 was. It's the annoying, codependent, micromanaging, overbearing secretary everyone dreads.:2017-04-20:BigMuskie
Samsung Galaxy S7:Wish I could give it a big fat 0!:Worst phone ever!!! As an Apple hater I'm ready to switch! Along with carrier! Upgraded from 6 to 7 worst decision, ever! Wi-Fi stinks,  even in a 400 sq ft apt in France. In my own home it's not even usable.  Takes webpages up to 2 minutes to load, unless I stand by router.  Half the time the screen froze. After new purchase didn't work, 6 hours of phone time later,  sent a refurbished one. Same issues, plus contacts wouldn't transfer. Two more hours phone.  3rd one arrived refurbished. Still the Wi-Fi is worthless, unless  you're next to the router. And verizon wouldn't let me go back to my 6! Pigeon holed into using data or another upgrade. And I'm only 45 days out.:2017-04-19:Maui11r
Samsung Galaxy S7:Too many issues:Good news is the poor battery life kills the phone so fast you don't have to deal with the other issues. Biggest issue after battery life is non stop dropping wifi. No signal where I work so straight wifi and it drops it at least 4-5 times an hours. Contacted Verizon and they were no help. Told me to contact Samsung, I didn't buy the phone from Samsung, I bought it from Verizon.:2017-04-16:Tony74
Samsung Galaxy S7:I mean... it worked at first:When I first got this phone, yeah it worked great. And then it took a dark turn and it would freeze, it wouldn't play videos (and I mean videos in my GALLERY not online), I couldn't get the screen to turn on. (this was a month after getting it). So, sure... maybe I just got a defective one. So I got a new one since that one was clearly messed up. It worked for a while, but it just wiped my entire SD card of its data... why? No idea. Just felt like it apparently. So 70% of my media is now gone. Forever. It's also lagging a lot. And mind you, I don't have a lot of apps on here. All I use the phone for is Amazon Music, Instagram, Facebook, texting, and calling. That's it. (Seriously, not even games). But apparently I'm the only one with a bad streak with this phone and now I'm stuck with it for another year... joy... if you don't want hassle, avoid this phone. There's plenty more.:2017-04-15:Kira1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Hate this phone:Got this phone new in December.  People can not hear me.  Say I just fade out plus it sounds like wind blowing when I talk.  I can only get reburbished phones which have their own problems.  I am on phone 4 If this does not work, will just pay off and get something different.  I am totally stressed right now about my phone. Have visited Verizon about 20 times in last few weeks.:2017-04-14:Stormy8
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not working properly!:Randomly rebooting , looking for command! Locks up can't be used! Called support since I'm within my 14 day return policy they ordered me Samsung galaxy s8 for replacement:2017-04-12:Cwgrlkimberly
Samsung Galaxy S7:Was expecting better:Was expecting bigger screen an more sound, picture was very nice. Service is very good an data speed is nice, i like verizon but just the phone i have im not satisfied with.:2017-04-09:Natedigg970
Samsung Galaxy S7:It over heats too quickly and battery dies quick.:Would not purchase this phone.  The phone over heats too easily.  It looses battery power really fast.  Camara  is bad:2017-04-06:Mary  A
Samsung Galaxy S7:Wish we never got it:They already swapped out my phone once and it didn't change a thing. The keyboard is very difficult to use it is smaller than the S5. Things just randomly stopped working.:2017-04-06:Bourban
Samsung Galaxy S7:Hey at least it's new:If you love Samsung phones then this phone is for you. But if you like software updates, available memory, and apps not notifying you every hour about some Verizon or Samsung product then this phone is not for you. The phone seems to be responsive for the most part. For some reason everything slows down when you try and take a picture. It takes at least 30 -45 seconds for the Bluetooth to connect to any device. Also the UI is touchwiz which is still completely horrible:2017-04-04:AnthonyViola
Samsung Galaxy S7:2nd Galaxy phone with problems:2 years ago bought S6.  Day 16 it crapped out.  Could not exchange bc Verizon only gives you 14 days to exchange.  Had to send in for a refurb.   Refurb phone died in less than 2 years.    Just bought S7 and having problems again.  Notifications not being sent.  Finger touches delayed or not at all.  I'm done with Samsung.:2017-04-04:Samsung junk
Samsung Galaxy S7:Cons out way the pros on this phone:I have been waiting to upgrade, for a few yrs now. I had a Casio g zone battle tank of a phone. I  beat it. But it got slow, obsolete.  I finally gave in and was persuaded to get this s7 cause of water resistant, vr gear, etc.  While it takes excellent photos, it makes and receives calls like junk.  Everyone I call keeps saying they can't hear me, and I  hear them. With volume am the way up, all I hear is a rattle or warble in the speaker during a call, like a crackling sound.  And if you don't turn it up  volume is so bad I can't hear.  I don't care how much onboard memory it  our how cool the vr gear is,(even though that is so cool)  it don't make for agood phone.  I'm highly disappointed with this and I just got it...I hope it at least holds up till I get it paid for.:2017-04-04:salesperson
Samsung Galaxy S7:I feel like it's melting:The phone is pretty good, but I've had to return it twice because the battery gets so overheated when it's charging AND the battery doesn't stay charged for very long.:2017-04-03:DigitalHustler
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery life is horrible:Samsung Galaxy S7 battery life is horrible. I was talked into this by the salesman and I'm very disappointed.:2017-04-02:Cgouley
Samsung Galaxy S7:S5 may have had less memory but was a better phone - more practical:Coming from Galaxy S5 which had rubber, I am finding the S7 too delicate and slippery. The screen is less responsive than the S5. Dumb things such as stopwatch stopping if you need to darken the screen while the phone is in your pocket make the feature totally useless. And it was something that worked perfectly in the S5.:2017-04-01:Verizon customer  001
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awful:Batter never charges over 74% and phone dies ridiculously fast. Took it to try and get it fixed but nobody could even figure out what the problem was.:2017-03-29:jshook
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not great:Shuts off randomly, pictures blurry, hopefully I can exchange it without getting stuck with a bunch of fees:2017-03-27:OwlTeacher
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very Poor Cell Reception:Had to return and go back to a new I-phone. I know it is an issue with the Samsung because inside a vehicle with my daughter, she was getting good reception with an I-phone but I had nothing but no signal issues.:2017-03-27:Lolita62
Samsung Galaxy S7:no:The phone is to small compared to what I had before and really does not cut the musturd, I really thought it would have been okay but it is not. Apps are slow to start compared to my other phone , the camera was easier to use on my old phone, if I could I would get rid of it for a another phone. I can't believe the salesperson recommended it after seeing what I had ad the transfer of data did not get completed . Place was short handed  etc.:2017-03-25:kdphone
Samsung Galaxy S7:Don't buy Galaxy S7:This phone loses battery even on safer mode.  It drops calls.  It freezes.  The recent update has made it very difficult to navigate and print extremely small.  It also left some apps not usable.  Over all a very poor choice of phone.:2017-03-24:brailledot
Samsung Galaxy S7:Bloody impossible phone to navigate or understand.:Nothing on this phone is intuitive or makes sense, impossible to find a decent music playing program, battery life is terrible, too large, messaging is terrible, sending or receiving a video is a joke, unable to send more than one picture, attempting to understand why there are three different messaging and voicemail apps on my phone is infuriating, trying to set ringtones is a nightmare, and the camera roll is horribly designed and trying to save a picture is a project in itself. If I could return this phone I would do so in a heartbeat, it is no better than an iPhone, but at least that is straight forward enough to understand. I will never return to an android phone.:2017-03-19:jayisaac89
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not much to say is good for this model.:The only thing better than the s5 is the built in memory. Much worse than the s6 except the extra memory. Still no HDMI out so it's a no-buy for me.:2017-03-17:JackSpraty
Samsung Galaxy S7:I hate this Samsung Galaxy G7:All it does is bombard me with advertisements.  It's brand new so it can't have a virus unless it came with one.  I've never had a phone that does that before.  None of the instructions I've found online to get rid of these annoying ads work.  I've had several different smartphones and none of them have done this.  If you want to swipe an ad every time you want to use your phone then this is the phone for you.:2017-03-17:DavidLHCB
Samsung Galaxy S7:I don't like this phone at all,:I don't care for this phone it is to small ant hard for me to see and type on. I am going to trade it on for a phone with a bigger screen.:2017-03-15:BDPerkins
Samsung Galaxy S7:gets extremly hot after minutes of browsing:the phone gets extremely hot when I browse facebook for more then a few minutes or anytime I watch a video on you tube. Its also very laggy even compaired to my note 3 that I was using. the glass back is stupid I have had it less then 2 weeks and there is already a crack in the back. The 360 gear camera that came with it is  complete junk anything more then a foot away is grainy I have my doubts about the advertised 30mp. All and all it was a terrible move upgrading and I wish I would have just kept my old phone!!:2017-03-10:aaron509
Samsung Galaxy S7:Worst phone I have ever had the misfortune of owning!:Absolutely terrible. I am counting the days until my phone contract is up. I own two phones- one for work, one for personal use. Samsung phone never works in my neighborhood, especially in my home. The iPhone works pretty well. Obviously the samsung phone is not compatible for my service area. I have attempted to reach a solution via verizon customer service multiple times, but no permanent resolve has been accomplished. Still not able to use my phone for the simplest of needs-talking! So disappointing.:2017-03-08:NCMTN
Samsung Galaxy S7:Less than  you s5.:Can't download photos to my computer. Battery life is only marginal. Security features are a pain (finger print didn't always work). Sound controls are hard to work through case.:2017-03-05:Chasmo
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not a leap forward:Non removable battery is probably the worst aspect.  My s5 lasted at least 3/4 the day before hitting 40%.  S7 is at 30%  at half the day. Edges are unresponsive with or without screen protector. No Glass protectors  fit the edges.. started gathering dirt and peeling off in the first week. Removed the feature of tapping screen to take photo.  Speaker although it has a better placement doesn't cut it.  I just can't recommend this phone to anyone.  The only thing I find decent about this phone is the amount of internal storage for those apps that keep transferring back when they update.  Was a problem with the s5 .:2017-03-04:Coralias
Samsung Galaxy S7:Horrible transition from my s5:The only thing better than the s5 is the built in memory. Samsung really dropped the ball on the design of the s7. nothing has impressed me about it.:2017-03-01:plnmch
Samsung Galaxy S7:this is the WORST PHONE I HAVE EVER OWNED.:unfortunaly you cant give 0 stars or i would......this is by far the absolute worst phone I have ever owned. the front breaks, the back breaks. one small ding in the screen and the  phone  will not turn on anymore....... for something so dang expensive I would expect something of quality. now im boned with no phone. terrible, terrible, terrible.:2017-02-25:jrjrhhhhhh
Samsung Galaxy S7:Glass Shatters Front AND BACK!!!:This phone completely shattered when it fell about 2 feet to the ground.  Not only the front, but the back too!  It's impossible to remove the back, and there is jagged sharp glass sticking out.:2017-02-22:SamsunguserNY
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nothing but problems.:This phone is absolute junk.  I'm assuming (and hoping) that previous generations were better phones.  I purchases this one with an upgrade in November, and just like the 1st Samsung phone I had, it was good for about a month.  After that, it has been nothing but problems.  I've already had to hard reset it twice, and claim warranty.  It overheats, and drains the battery at an alarming rate.  It overheats enough, that I can feel it heat up in my uniform pocket.  And the wifi and bluetooth signal are constantly dropping, or changing settings.  I have it connected, via bluetooth, to my watch, and sometimes I get the notifications, sometimes I don't.  Sometimes it syncs, sometimes it doesn't.  All depends on how the phone is operating that day.  And while my computer and tablet can manage with the wifi connection, this phone is hit, or miss.  And that's upsetting, because then it either won't work, or use the data connection.  Then, there are the apps.  I'm constantly having issues with the phone running, or loading the apps. And it's frustrating, because I use the basics.  I don't play games all day on my phone.  I don't use my phone all that much, all day, for that matter.  Yet, it is nothing but problems, and constantly having issues, as described above.:2017-02-20:Figorous
Samsung Galaxy S7:Hated this phone:The price and size of the phone is what drew me to purchase the S7. However, I disliked the set up of the phone, the inability to change/add apps to folders, phone wouldn't connect to the bluetooth in my vehicle, speaker phone did not work. Ended up hating it and exchanged it for the LG G5.:2017-02-19:tahtahfn
Samsung Galaxy S7:Horrible. Going back to S6.:-Can't adjust screen sensitivity, so now texting and generally using the phone is VERY frustrating because it's not sensitive enough (I've heard others complain it is too sensitive) -I use my phone to record video at work, they made some weird framing changes that cause the phone to zoom in after you press record. SO. That means I have to frame the shot while already pressing record. UNLESS I change to VGA which sacrafices resolution. VERY irritating.  And yes. I did research online to see if I could fix these issues. I'll come back and update on other things that upset me later if I don't give up and return the phone today. I like that you can expand the memory and was looking forward to using that feature, too bad I won't get to.:2017-02-15:astrodrmr
Samsung Galaxy S7:Piece of Junk:This particular S7 I was sold is nothing but junk. Owned it for 11 days and nothing but troubles with it.  I will be taking it back to the store for a replacement:2017-02-15:Mech59
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery life extremely poor:Battery drains in roughly 15 hours.  Turned off applications, scanning for wireless, etc.  camera quit working. Have always loved my Samsung products but this is the worst phone I've owned.:2017-02-12:Rdfa
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not at all happy.:This phone is too complicated and facile. Its already cracked. I had my s5 for 2 years and never any problems our damage. Three days and my new phone was cracked.:2017-02-10:Bobbiemac61
Samsung Galaxy S7:Don't go too far from the charger!:I HATE THIS PHONE! I keep as many APPS turned off as possible. I don't stream video. I make very few phone calls or texts and rarely check email from this device. It is also very cumbersome to carry. I have tried various ways including belt clips which get tangled in the seat belt of my truck. I am very active, on and off of machines, in and out of my vehicle. Unless you have a sedate office job, access to electricity and a large pack to carry this device. Buy something else!:2017-02-10:Tractor Man
Samsung Galaxy S7:Terrible phone!!! So disappointed with Verizon & my Galaxy S7 !!:I am very upset with my new phone! The battery is terrible.  Anyone that speaks to me on the phone says they cant hear me. I hear static. Soooo disappointed!!!!!   I feel like I threw my money away. Apple is better by far!!:2017-02-08:Melissa26
Samsung Galaxy S7:Worse purchase ever!!:I've only had this phone for about two weekseparate now and I'm already regretting it. The signal on my galaxy s7 is the worse I'very ever experienced. I usually only get one bar inside and only two outside. For the price I'm paying I shouldn't need to go outside everything I want to surf the Internet or send messages. And to add to this, the keyboard is way too sensitive, it keeps closing out while I'm typing. I thought it would improve once I got a case and protective screen but it still has the issue and just did it at least five times as I'm typing this review...very frustating! I would love to return this phone but I've already  invested too much time into it.:2017-02-07:noy_noy
Samsung Galaxy S7:I HATE THIS PHONE:I do not like the company or the business practices that the company uses.  I will terminate my services in the near future:2017-02-06:Hate the service
Samsung Galaxy S7:I feel like I went from a grownup phone to a baby phone.:It's small and had way less features than my note 7 which I was FORCED to give up and I in general hate this phone.:2017-02-05:Bri123
Samsung Galaxy S7:2nd phone in 3 months and stopped working again:I got a new Galaxy 7 in November. The problem started right away. I would try caling and it would sign off. If someone called me it would kick over to voice mail. After 3 months of resetting the phone they gave me a new phone this Monday. well this morning I tried to make a call and the phone would Not work again. On my way to Verizon again.:2017-02-03:Gary4pat
Samsung Galaxy S7:Didn't like it:I think I am just more of an iPhone person. I will be going this weekend to change phones. The Galaxy is slow and their finger print technology doesn't work as well.:2017-02-02:Ashlie Coleman
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not worth the effort of a brand switch:Samsung is not the leader of any game! Not happy and stuck with it! Not 30 days like I was told originally! Only 14!:2017-01-24:Kristytheunhappy1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Junk:Had a note 3 loved the phone very user friendly the screen got shattered so in the way of cell phone time to upgrade .First the phone fell 1 foot onto carpet the back shattered second the touch screen Is extremely unresponsive and very small third the battery life sucks charge all night unplug it 3 hours later needs charged again .The photo gallery is very hard to organize it is not user friendly the colors for message are limited if you want a great phone they dropped the ball on this one .:2017-01-24:JT1500
Samsung Galaxy S7:Issues in one month!:Samsung doe not stand behind their products.  Would not replace faulty product in the first month.  They expect you to mail in phone for repair.  Long time user of Samsung phones.  They must be having financial trouble for the issues with their other products.    Bad customer service.  The parrot back their policy.:2017-01-23:Paul I
Samsung Galaxy S7:I hate this phone:I had to get this phone through insurance because my other phone got dropped in water. Compared to my Note5 I hate this phone. Its small and the screen cover comes up on the sides even with store install on the screen protector.. I wanted an iphone 7 so it compared in size but through insurance they have to stay with the same manufacture. I hate this phone..:2017-01-17:BeccahLynne
Samsung Galaxy S7:Water Resistance-Fraud  Warranty Bogus.  Customer Service- non existant:"Bought the phone 50 days ago- 40 days ago it stopped working. You know this great phone that is supposed to be water resistant- technically certified for up to 5 feet for 30 minutes...not true.  Dropped mine for a few seconds in a few inches of water.  Screen immediately went nuts.  Company says they are ""designed to be water resistant"" but doesn't mean your actual device is.  With a claim like that- Verizon shouldn't even sell this product. Called Samsung- was told that is the phone is exposed to any moisture, then it is not covered by warranty...for anything.  Yes the phone that Samsung & Verizon sold us as water resistant and so you don't need that bulky cover, it not actually backed as water resistant.   How does Samsung get you to proceed?  Well there are certain Samsung repair centers, as I later found out they are specially certified Geek Squad centers at Best Buy.  I live in the Philadelphia area and the only repair center is over an hour away.  I bring it there, wait in line for an hour and guess what...they won't even touch it because I said it was exposed to moisture.  They won't even check it out.  I know know that Samsung doesn't even know what its other hand is doing. I then call Samsung again, they have me send it to their repair center.  I am told they will email me once evaluated to tell me whether it is warranty (knew that would be an argument) or an estimate for repairs.  All I get is an email saying it is being sent back.  Abuse to screen due to moisture. I then spend 2 hours on the phone with ""technical support."" who says, they can't tell me what is wrong or why its not warranty.  They also say they sent it back because ""The repair center will not due any non-warranty work because they are so overwhelmed"" so even if I wanted to pay, I couldn't.  (Gee wonder why they are overwhelmed- could it be bad products?) It gets better, I asked for Customer Support..the supervisor claimed that Samsung doesn't have a Customer Support or Customer Service Department.  Really, a company the size of Samsung doesn't have a customer service department?!? I would say buyer beware.  If you go and read the Consumer Reports article on the S7 Active, they had 2 or 3 out of 5 failing the water test.  Samsung said they fixed the production issue...however there will always be ones that are not water resistant because while they ""are designed to be water resistant"" it doesn't mean they are.  Translation- if anything ever goes wrong due to any moisture, they will say it is your fault and not the manufacturing. I would be fine with having the random ""bad"" phone so long as Samsung stood behind their product but so long as it is run around & denial, I am going to have to switch away from Samsung even though I have a history of using their product.  (Remember they denied their battery issues and their clothes washer issues for a long time prior to finally recalling)":2017-01-16:S7isGarbage
Samsung Galaxy S7:Don't do it.:I purchased this phone as an upgrade from my LG G2. I wish I had my old phone back!! I've had the phone for 6 months, and the pixels have started dying. The Verizon tech said it was probably caused from pressure on the screen and that the phone isn't as durable as I was previously lead to believe. Hate it. If I had known, I would have stayed with LG.:2017-01-14:Sam5388
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very Sorry I Gave Up My Galazy S6:I bought this phone because my S6 was almost a year and a half old and was beginning to act up.  You know, the batter started heating up and it wouldn't keep a charge, so I decided to buy the S7 because I loved my S6.  By what a disappointment this phone is.  You can't hear anyone on the other side of the receiver when making a call or receiving a call, you hear terrible feed back and echo's.  It is even worse when trying to use the speaker phone or my blue tooth.  The service dept. has tried to help fix it and so far hasn't had any luck.  I went on a trip and used the GPS (Google Maps App).  I use this all the time on my S6.  The S7 sent me in complete circles, telling me to go straight and then make a U-turn.  It got so bad, that my client who was following me had to put the address we were going to into his phone and I had to follow him.  I am so disappointed with this phone.  I can't wait to give it back.:2017-01-13:do1025
Samsung Galaxy S7:Extremely poor battery life!!!:I upgraded to this phone as my Droid Maxx was 2 years old and not keeping a charge. Well this phone is supposed to be brand new and I have to charge it TWICE a day! I've turned off functions (why should I have to do this?) just to save battery life and it still drains the battery in less than 8 hours and most of that time it's not being used! Not a happy camper with this phone.:2017-01-11:Smellycat
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone:I got it Dec 30th 2016 and I don't like it but I'm stuck with it for two years I wish I could just get another one but I don't think I'm allowed this early in my contract but I guess I'll just wait and in two years just go with another provider:2017-01-11:Keithquinn1
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone sucks:I bought the phone on a friday and by monday i was taking it back...no signal, and the battery life was sorry.:2017-01-11:cheryl40
Samsung Galaxy S7:Hate it!:When we received the phone the screen was shattered and was told there was nothing they could do about it!:2017-01-11:Aaa1237
Samsung Galaxy S7:Really Bad Phone.:I switched over from iPhone to Samsung thinking the Galaxy would be a better phone. There weren't any problems for a little bit, but now this phone is becoming a problem. It's overheating and the battery goes out really fast. Plus it cracks too easily.:2017-01-11:bravesfan1144
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awful:I replaced my Galaxy S4 with the S7 only because my boyfriend's phone broke and I had an upgrade available. I want my S4 back! This phone has less features, settings and is so much harder to navigate. I am really disappointed with this phone. I should have gone with the Google Pixel.:2017-01-06:Dixiewixie123
Samsung Galaxy S7:This should only be used with gloves on and in a rubber room:This phone is the most expensive and most breakable phone i have ever had. I should be able use a phone normally without it breaking but that is not possible with this phone. Within 1 month of owning this phone i dropped it from my hand onto the hardwood floor in my house and the screen broke (had a screen protector on it). Then yesterday i dropped it on my driveway when getting out of the car and shattered the rear of the phone which for some reason is made of glass. If you going to buy this phone i recommend you purchase a screen protector and the best phone case possible either that or cover it in bubble wrap because this the most fragile phone i have ever seen. As far as the performance of the phone goes it is great but i will never  spend another dime on a Samsung phone until they can figure out how to build a phone that can withstand daily life without me having to spend hundreds of dollars additional for a screen protector and phone cover which completely negates the slimness of this phone. Not impressed at all.:2017-01-04:Goobyb4u8
Samsung Galaxy S7:Expensive.....service poor:Don't think I get what I pay for:2017-01-03:Mary0515
Samsung Galaxy S7:Cell phone doesnt work at my house:I recently upgraded 2 phones on my plan from a Samsung 3 to Samsung 7 models. With the new models I am not able to make or be heard on calls that come to my new cell phone when at my home. I did not have this issue with my Samsung 3. The store associates tried to help and I even called the Verizon 800# and that still doesn't make it work like my old phone did. I use my cell as my work# so this is very a bad experience I am having with Verizon. I just want to make, receive and be heard when using my cell#. At this point I can test and play game apps at that's about it. I am very disappointed and will look for better service.:2017-01-03:heidi heidi
Samsung Galaxy S7:I am not happy in the color it came in...I wanted silver and I felt I was pressured to take the gold:This was the worst phone shopping experience I have ever had...I almost cancelled my plan with Verizon and and switched to Union instead...I am still considering on swithing...:2017-01-01:Natina

Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery life is garbage!:I've had this phone for 1 1/2 weeks and can't wait to return it. The battery life is worse than my 3 year old Galaxy 5. Plus the case is so slick it forces you to buy a rubber case just to get a grip.:2016-12-27:timcda
Samsung Galaxy S7:Feedback Samsung 7:"I do not like this phone. It gets really hot quickly.  The ""large' font is not large and unable to zoom text messages  The key pad is touchy and too small. I miss my Galaxy Note 3. It seems to be missing something. I cannot edit my pictureson. My screen has cracked in 2 places with the screen protector on it and pieces are chipped off. I am not happy with this phone at all. Wish I never got it":2016-12-27:Ghost buster

Within the first day of use, we noticed the phone getting very warm during the charging process.  The battery life in only about 5.5 hours, on a good day.:2016-12-14:AngieMN
Samsung Galaxy S7:DON'T BUY SAMSUNG GALAXY S7.:BUY A DIFFERENT PHONE!!! I bought this samsung galaxy s7 back in March. It's been a constant struggle with the autocorrect, spelling words that aren't even close to what I typed out, battery drains faster and faster, camera lense is a glass cover that breaks easily and will cost $150 to fix, apps run without being turned on. Screen is too sensitive and messes with text messages or google searches. You will also have issues with wifi. It will say no connection when I am less than 3 feet away from the router. Dropped and lost phone calls with people IN TOWN!!!   I've corrected the autocorrect at least 2 dozen times while typing this review. Buy a different phone! It's not worth the price tag even at monthly payments. Autocorrect made typing this review a headache! Have to go thru and correct lots and lots and lots of errors made by this phone! BUY A DIFFERENT PHONE!:2016-12-13:RexusRaven
Samsung Galaxy S7:not in same class as Note 7:I wanted a Google Pixel XL but had to settle for a S7 after the Note7 debacle. But sadly the Pixels are not ready yet. I felt forced and am not happy at all.:2016-12-13:bobby847

Samsung Galaxy S7:Very poorly made:Glass shattered after 24 hours of activating. Fell off nightstand which was barely 2 feet. I've owned the Galaxy 5 and the Galaxy 3. I never had a problem with either one. My Galaxy 5 is still in perfect shape after dropping it 100s of times with much larger force and height. I even dropped the galaxy 5 down a flight of stairs and not a scratch. Verizon and Samsung refuse to help! Shouldn't phones improve with upgrades and not be made of poorer quality??:2016-12-06:Sanya
Samsung Galaxy S7:Do not like the Galaxy s7:I just got my new phone and I DO NOT like it. I had a Galaxy s5 and LOVED my phone. the features were so me, not this one. There is no smart alarm. No air view. The SD card is a different size. The transfer of data was great. I just don't like the s7. I loved my s5.:2016-12-06:Rene2016

Samsung Galaxy S7:Hate this phone:This phone slips out of your hand, I can't find a otter box that will work right with it, the screen is super sensitive, if you hit the edge it will click in other screens. I came from a note 3 and this was the only upgrade option that I have for a bigger Samsung phone, since we try to stay with the Samsung line. They took the note 5 off the market and can't no longer get the 7 note. I'm truly disappointed, I'm thinking of taking this phone back and finding a used note 5. And this phone is slow!!! I took the first one back because the screen does its own thing!!!!:2016-12-03:Angelgarcia76
Samsung Galaxy S7:horrible phone:I got this phone 2 months ago and i have had nothing but issues.  It freezes up, its gets hot.  It never has internet connection.  Verizon has now sent me 4 replacements phones and nothing is working.  I am considering switching providers.  I had my orginial phone not even a week before it started having all of these issues.:2016-12-02:acrowe34
Samsung Galaxy S7:Bought two of them and neither one wI'll work.:Two brand new phones and neither one will access the network.:2016-12-02:Awelb2002
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not liking this phone!:I made a huge mistake taking this deal now I am stuck for 2 years with 2 of these phones after the 2 years is up, TRASH! Getting something different.:2016-12-01:Chillura65
Samsung Galaxy S7:It was a fairly easy transition:Bought about 1 and 1/2 weeks ago. Love the phone, how fast it is. Not happy with the selection of glass screen protectors available.:2016-11-30:Maria B
Samsung Galaxy S7:Horrible experience S5 to S7 Up(actually, down)Grade:"The upgrade process from S5 to S7 was horrible. It is WAAAAAAAAY to technical and extremely difficult to end up on an S7 at the same place (same files, contacts, memos, etc.) where one left off on the S5.   The device itself (S7) has no obvious advantage over the S5 - in fact, it is smaller and typing is more difficult.   Additionally, arranging the ""desktop"" is horrible, unintuitive and provides too many opportunities for things to go wrong with the face of the device changing and one is left in the dark as to how to undo the last step (why don't you have an ""Undo"" button?) All in all my experience was so bad that i am considering returning the device and subscribing to a more reasonable plan with another carrier.":2016-11-26:BeyMelamed
Samsung Galaxy S7:Unhappy:Very unhappy with the product that quality sold to me with my phone ...with the phone  I've been having static and calls not being heard ...:2016-11-25:Delfina
Samsung Galaxy S7:Probably return it:Had the phone a week. Won't hold a charge.  Almost exactly the same as my old phone.  Not impressed.:2016-11-21:Whyrhebigfussovernickname
Samsung Galaxy S7:Big Brother is watching:The phone appears ok, but most of the preloaded apps stink. The contact manager wants me to share my camera to edit my contacts. Really? many of the other preloaded apps are like that wanting me to share information etc. that they don't needed to run. Who needs big brother when you have big corporate watching everything you do.:2016-11-21:unhappy300
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not in love:I find that the phone gets very hot when used for prolong time, either talking or playing games. The content from my previous phone did not all transfer over as I was told it would.  I was told I could put my memory chip in this phone and can't.:2016-11-21:smgismom
Samsung Galaxy S7:Overheating while charging:Would constintly overheat while charging. It ended up melting the plastic case around it. Not Happy with the Galaxy 7. But then again all Galaxy Products in general are having issues with catching fire or melting due to poor batteries:2016-11-20:Bfnelson
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery died to fast:The batteries will not last a day if your using it. You need to shut off everything if you want it to last a day.  I token it back after 3 days to be told that is not a good reason to exchange it.  I can't imagine what it will be like in 2 years not happy:2016-11-17:Mgill
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awful:The battery sucks. The icons are huge. The camera is grainy. Bad phone all around.:2016-11-15:Jcmama1982
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not the note:Id rather have my note 7 back:2016-11-15:Wishing4thenote8000x
Samsung Galaxy S7:Horrible compared to my old note 5, or note 7:Forced to get this s7 because of the recalled note 7. I dislike it so much, the look and feel and smaller screen and battery life. Nope not happy at all:2016-11-14:Dunn27
Samsung Galaxy S7:Volume is horrendous:Volume is terrible! Even on speakerphone extremely low. I had an S4 previously and the volume and speaker was much louder. Very hard  to set up.:2016-11-11:Mike CGN9
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not happy:I hear an echo every time on phone, bad reception and signal for data and calls. Battery life is mediocre:2016-11-04:Chrisbo
Samsung Galaxy S7:6058807105:I got the 7 Note for my husband for his job, he loved it. Then it got recalled and had to switch phones we got him the S7, he does not like it at all. It takes forever for anything to load, update, or connect to any thing.:2016-11-01:jlgerzen16
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung s7:I received a broken screen phone. Verizon will not take back. I waited for the note 7 after recall and still received a phone that the battery heated up. The only choice I had was a Samsung s7. The s7 is a lot smaller than note 4 and 7.:2016-11-01:Julesbear
Samsung Galaxy S7:Miss my note 7:I loved the note 7.  The screen on the s7 is too small.:2016-10-30:Happy6384
Samsung Galaxy S7:I'm sure this is a decent phone but...:I got this to replace my Note 7 and I'm not happy with it. It's too small. Came preloaded with freemium games and it's not the Note. I know that's not really verizons fault but the phone I really wanted was the note 7. I didn't have any problems with it. This phone is a poor replacement. I will never buy an iphone and the pixel is too new to know anything about so I guess I'm stuck with something I don't like for now.:2016-10-29:Bfraz2186
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not to impressive:I bought it about a week ago not to impressive:2016-10-29:Clark000
Samsung Galaxy S7:Incredibly slow:Got this as a replacement for my Note 7 and it is terrible. It basically does not function on WiFi; all of my connections time out. I read that this was an issue if you were running Bluetooth at the same time, so I disabled Bluetooth but am still experiencing the same issues. The only plus side is the size; it actually fits in my pocket.:2016-10-28:Sdlindst88
Samsung Galaxy S7:hate this phone!!!:Very difficult to learn how to use; extremely difficult to download PIC's and still can't figure out how to get my videos off of it!  Quick phone links are not quick at all - take several steps.  The touch screen often 'rolls' instead of selecting what I have touched.   Took a lot of PIC's of a wedding to discover EVERY PIC was sideways....  Camera, 24megapixel, is suppose to be the best but so far the resolution is much worse then my 10 yr old 6megapixel camera.  Touch screen is horrible!!!  Just trying to get the screen to 'slide' to answer a call is a 2-handed job.  Just can't navigate effectively w/ o 2 hands - keeps selecting the wrong icons or sliding or instead of sliding selecting some icon.....  I was sold a 'Hard' case w/ extra screen guard.  DO NOT GET THESE!!  Hard case is 'bout impossible to get your phone out, unless standing up, and absolutely impossible to put back.  The extra screen stops the touch screen from detecting your touch - unable to select icons w/o pressing excessively hard or almost will not detect a slide almost entirely. Over all, if I could, I would return this for a full refund and and just get a $50 flip ph........:2016-10-27:Daniel8
Samsung Galaxy S7:Is not my note 7:This phone doesn't hold a candle it and it locks up and freezes all the time. I only had it a week and had to take it back twice. Wish I had waited.:2016-10-26:Rw1977
Samsung Galaxy S7:Get a Note 5 not a Galaxy 7:I had to downgrade from a Note 7. I hate the simplicity of the galaxy 7. It feels small, sluggish and has terrible battery life.:2016-10-26:Jyrdge
Samsung Galaxy S7:Junk phone!:"Replaced my Note 7 with this phone and don't like it all.  It ""freezes"" and I have to use the ""close all"" button to get out of the app, doesn't matter what app I am using, it does it to them all. My Galaxy s4 never did this and the Note 7 certainly didn't. I really regret getting this phone but now I'm stuck with it.":2016-10-26:Lindaetal
Samsung Galaxy S7:just was not what I thought it was going to be nothing different from my old phone:Just thought it would be different,:2016-10-24:Michelle309
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7:I bought 2weeks ago. The phone battery drained so fast and hot battery.:2016-10-24:leex3195
Samsung Galaxy S7:I would rather have my flammable phone...:I got suckered into this phone because i had the note 7... all tho i didnt like the curved glass that broke falling off my bed... at least i could use the phone like its supposed to be. This phone wont even let me be in a group text or send a pic thru text .  Just garbage... it always slow to do anything... im sure there is some stupid button clicked in my settting some where that wont let me send pics so i will have yo go ait in line at the verizon store for another 2 hrs... samsung is loosing me fast.... I hate iphones... but i may just have to switch...:2016-10-23:Amsch13
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointed:I had to trade in my note7 for this and I just can't get use to it plus I thinks it's refurbished. It's always freezing up. Very disappointed.:2016-10-23:papakoole
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not the best phone:I got this phone a week ago and I hate it did.:2016-10-19:Brr4259
Samsung Galaxy S7:Junk. Camera lens shattered while charging. Samsung blames users.:I was very excited to purchase the S7. I bought it before vacation. The camera was awesome. It allowed me to leave my DSLR at home. Great photos, great features. Then the glass lens on the camera shattered while the phone was charging. The phone was extremely hot to the touch. I started searching online, and found many others who had their cameras shatter while using their phones normally. Not because of dropping them, not because of abuse. I contacted Samsung and they blame the users. I've continually contacted them, and gotten stonewalled. Based on the battery problems Samsung is having, I would stay away from their products completely.:2016-10-18:nedsavoie
Samsung Galaxy S7:the representative was great.:bought the phone a week ago and I don't like it, is slow when I try to access anything on the phone and don't have good reception.:2016-10-16:oruiz
Samsung Galaxy S7:Nice features but fragile.:I purchased this phone 3 months ago (June, 2016). First upgrade in four years. You know that commercial where the guy bobbles the phone and drops it in a puddle of water? Well don't try that because if it breaks when that happens you are not covered by the warranty. And don't let the salesperson tell you you are. Yesterday while working in the yard I went to put my phone in my pocket and dropped it. That's about a three foot drop. The screen shattered to the point where I can't even turn the phone off. I thought maybe Samsung with all their problems would be interested in stepping up but they said there was NOTHING they could do for me. I'm done with Samsung.:2016-10-14:WebVideoGuy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not happy with phone:I was so happy with the previous galaxy 6 but this phone does not allow me to get online and my calls go in and out. So frustrating.....:2016-10-13:Tish1
Samsung Galaxy S7:DONT LIKE THIS PHONE:I am not happy at all with this phone and would like to exchange it without incurring a restocking fee. Please help. I also purchased the fast charger which i will not if i exchange the Galxy S7 for a Note5:2016-10-12:chaddy cathy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Fragile and poorly thought out.:I received this phone through my insurance four days ago. It's been kept in the provided case, never dropped, and I noticed the rear surface of the telephone is cracked. The back of the telephone is curved, and the smooth glass panel offers little purchase for someone with slick fingertips. Precision is required when using swype, more so than my previous GS4. Overall, a nerve-wracking phone to own.:2016-10-12:aero125
Samsung Galaxy S7:Poorly Made.:Whatever you do, don't let it out of your hand.  The phone was dropped while getting out of a car (maybe 1.5 feet) and the screen shattered...even with a protective case!  Save spending the extra $150 insurance deductible and buy a better phone.:2016-10-11:Gary794
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not satisfied:I bought this phone about a week ago and it's already giving me a hard time. It is slow and keeps not opening apps. I think I want to switch to an iPhone.:2016-10-09:Gracierosex3
Samsung Galaxy S7:Just an upgraded S5:I've had this phone for a week now and realized it's a waste of money if you already have a working s4/5/6. It's just a little faster and not as wide. The battery is as terrible as my 3 year old s4. Doesn't even hold a full charge for a whole day. Very disappointes:2016-10-09:Ricky6989
Samsung Galaxy S7:Complicated:Every function takes at least 3 steps. I despise this phone. I felt orced into this phone and the contract.:2016-10-08:Frustrated1958
Samsung Galaxy S7:Liked the HTC M8 much better, even after 2 years, wish I had it back:The battery life is no better than the HTC and it was 2 years old. Can't hold the phone without inadvertently touching buttons on the side. Attempting to unlock by double tapping notification doesn't go to the notification after unlocking.. Just a lot of things I expected to be better after other reviews.:2016-10-06:Dj7934
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone overheats when charging.:It has the worst battery life than any previous Samsung phone that I have owned.:2016-10-05:Bosn70
Samsung Galaxy S7:Too many unwanted  apps are offrered  FOR SALE by Verizon, , too much advertising, althis  coupled with Verizon's lack of customer support produces a:I bought the Samsung phone about 6 weeks ago, when the phone failer to work, I received no assistance from both Verizon and  the  ''Insurance Company'':2016-10-04:jkusa
Samsung Galaxy S7:Had to exchange phone:Had to exchange phone less then three days after I got it, sim card was exchanged still having issues:2016-10-03:Javier75
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy s7:I bought this phone 2 weeks ago and it's not much different from the s6. Phone is regular, it'snothing spectacular . Wish I didn't buy it.:2016-10-01:Meishar
Samsung Galaxy S7:Terrible, confusing, clunky:I'm going to struggle through for 2 years  maybe it's just a steep learning curve. Wish I would have stayed with iPhone.:2016-09-28:Kylnzak1
Samsung Galaxy S7:not a sturdy phone whatsoever:if you have a job or are an active person, do not get this phone. it's flimsy, lags, and is not worth the money. u fortunately I'm stuck with mine. only positive is the clarity of the phone and pictures.:2016-09-28:cflowers122q
Samsung Galaxy S7:Bad do not get the s7:I hate it everyday it will trun off and on and run the batter down bad I hate it.:2016-09-28:Michaelr59
Samsung Galaxy S7:"Worst ""smartphone"" I have owned":I had an iPhone for years while my wife had a Samsung Galaxy.  I made the mistake of listening to her and upgrading to the Galaxy S7.  After six months I can tell you I absolutely hate this phone.  Nothing is intuitive and nearly everything takes more effort than the iPhones I have used in the past.  Does the iPhone have its own shortfalls?  Yes.  However, I find the iPhone incredibly intuitive.  I accepted there would be a learning curve with the new OS but this is beyond that.  I do not get group messages and my group messages do not send.  There is little compatibility between Android users and iOS users.  This has been incredibly frustrating for myself and my family/friends.  Getting my device to sync with my home computer was another chore.  My apps do not work as smoothly as they did on iPhone either, which makes little sense to me.  The curved edges make the cases and screen protectors look stupid and ineffective.  I had a screen protector on my NON-curved iPhone for YEARS, no cracks.  I had my screen protector on the S7 and it is already cracked in two places after roughly six months.  I dropped my iPhone more than this phone and had it for years.  Stupid design.  What is wrong with squared edges that easy fit screen protection and cases?  Overall, I have been very unimpressed with the device and its performance.:2016-09-28:Bearden17
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone:Not happy with phone. Small and battery life is not good.:2016-09-22:Mkwade
Samsung Galaxy S7:S7:I bought this phone a few weeks and I'm not impressed. The battery life is poor. Even though I've turned off everything I can. And the creek is pretty small:2016-09-21:Rsatsky83
Samsung Galaxy S7:Don't buy!:Terrible!!! I am so disappointed that Verizon would sell this.  Terrible! The screen is suppose to be strong, but it cracks so easily.  I have gone through 2 phones.:2016-09-16:KatSq
Samsung Galaxy S7:Verizon disappointed so far:Had this about 10 days. Very disappointed with it compared to my Samsung 4s. If I wanted the functionality of an iPhone I would have bought one. Not seeing any improvements and thinking about returning it. It constantly has pop up apps that it wants me to download. When it's charging it has done additional lock screen that I need to unlock...that's a pain. I used to be able to delete emails by a quick swipe. Now it's a 2 step process. And speaking of email, mine keep deleting after a day or two. And the battery isn't as good a I thought it would be.  Seems to only last a day.. I don't stream and not on using it constantly.  I think I should at least get 2 days without a charge, but that isn't the case  for the first time not living my Samsung:2016-09-13:Debi k
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not happy:Battery don't last all day .like my 5s.can't get the pop up to stop coming up.and have people tell me that I cut out and can't hear me.never had that problem before.:2016-09-10:Jon00
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone's back shattered:I was so looking forward to this phone! As soon as I got it, the gallery app on the phone to view my photos would not work. The app crashes every time I try to open in. And then, after just 5 days of use, the back of the phone shattered! It had not been dropped and has a case on it and everything! I am working on getting it replaced or repaired, but I am incredibly disappointed in the quality of this phone. It is clearly defective.:2016-09-09:BethWasHere
Samsung Galaxy S7:New Samsung S7:Wish I would have kept my old Droid Maxx. This Samsung S7 takes FOREVER to charge and the battery barely lasts the day.  It also keeps saying it is offline when try to connect to the Internet.  My old phone never did that. I am not impressed with this Samsung S7.:2016-09-07:madatnewphone
Samsung Galaxy S7:Screen goes black:I bought this phone April and in about 3 weeks into it, I go to turn on screen and screen goes completely black. I get my husband hp one to call mine and my phone rings, and I can also hear message go through. But my screen I still completely black. I can return it cuz didn't have any insurance and couldn't afford a new one when I just for one. I HATE this ohone. Don't buy.:2016-09-03:Anna1223
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointed:Bought week ago and very disappointed.  Seems I down graded instead of upgrade. Less things on it, unable to transfer my info.:2016-08-31:GAAngelPeach
Samsung Galaxy S7:A pain in the butt phone:I got this phone about 3 or 4 months ago and every time there is an updated I loss my contacts and then I have to call Verizon to have them put them back on my phone the last update I said the forget it so I don't have all my contacts I should have just stayed with my s5:2016-08-30:RondajBlevins
Samsung Galaxy S7:Plenty Features...... But.............:It's not all what they make it out to be....  Since the beginning of August 2016 until now 8/29/16, I've had 3 phones.  The first one blacked out & the home key didn't operate. The second one the battery got real hot & the phone was blinking on & off.. Now the 3rd phone... After taking a lot of pictures the home screen shut off & the Home key wouldn't operate... Had to wait a couple of minute to come back on & needed to make a very important phone call..  Not happy with this phone at all.......:2016-08-29:Queengiles
Samsung Galaxy S7:No I blaster:Sucks. Dumb. Stupid.:2016-08-26:The Genius
Samsung Galaxy S7:Finger print security is not reliable:Do not enable the finger print security.  It is not reliable and when it fails you lose all your information.  I would not purchase this phone again .  Phone microphone works poorly.:2016-08-26:L1228
Samsung Galaxy S7:Its ok:Wish i would have known about the more sturdy verson:2016-08-25:MysticNessaSan
Samsung Galaxy S7:Worst phone I've bought yet.:Evolve forums iPhone in the past couple of decades this one breaks easier than any. It seems to shatter very easily. Didn't even have it a month before it cracked the first time.:2016-08-24:Jimbo76
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery life is awful!!:I traded in my Verizon Droid cellphone because I was having major problems with that phone because Verizon will only replace your phone with a refurbished phone.  After several replacements and extreme frustration  I replaced the Droid Maxx for the Samsung Galaxy S7. The battery life is absolutely awful!! I had to purchase a mophie in order to keep the phone charged through the day. My phone by lunch time is just about done. My phone has spent more time on a charger or mophie then in use? I only charge the phone during the day so it doesn't get over charged. I also close out of my apps so I don't drain the battery and close out of any Internet sites that I access but unfortunately nothing works.  Now I'm stuck with this phone for the next two years!! I have made a mental note to never buy another Samsung phone. Buyer beware, do not buy this phone unless you buy a mophie so you can keep charging the phone and also if you don't mind a phone with a very tiny, tiny battery!! Not a happy lady!!:2016-08-23:Unhappy Samsung Lady
Samsung Galaxy S7:Cracked in pocket on day six:On the sixth day the phone screen  cracked. Would not recommend this product to any real person who lives in the real world:2016-08-23:7kilps9
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy 7S... Hate it:This phone is the worse. To many things to list that are wrong with it. Hope I can return it:2016-08-23:Fordott
Samsung Galaxy S7:Quality bad:Bought this phone week ago, taking it back tomorrow.  People call and can not hear me. Say I sound far away or can't hear me at all.:2016-08-21:55sandy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Love the camera. But that's it. The phone lags and apps won't work:Love the camera but that's it. The phone lags and apps won't work. Even with re-download information and clearing cache and cookies..:2016-08-20:Mikey6
Samsung Galaxy S7:So fragile!:This phone is not made for people who live a rugged life style. The phone will break! Do not buy it is too fragile.:2016-08-20:Bliyz
Samsung Galaxy S7:Don't buy this phone:I bought this phone a week ago but I had problems since day 1. I hate not to been able to unlock the screen with the fingerprint. And even though I had read my notifications they still on my home screen until I clear them off:2016-08-19:famsung

Samsung Galaxy S7:Not impressed:Had this phine for like 2 weeks. Not impressed.  Battery is the same as my s6 the only upgrade is the camera.  I should of held out for the the s7 note. Lesson learned:2016-08-16:Nvncy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery life not good at all:From reading all the reviews about the battery life I decided to upgrade. I am so disappointed. Unless you have this on power saving it does not last at all. And the worst part having it on power saving you loose a lot of functions. I couldn't figure out why for a few days my emails were not coming through and it was because of the power save. This sits on my desk and I may check email or Facebook but it goes from 100% to 60% before lunch and I'm not spending alot of time on it. I have to keep my portable charger with me if I'm going to be out for the day. Not worth the money. Maybe I got a bum phone. Verizon I love my Samsung's but don't like this one:2016-08-15:Dolphin2359
Samsung Galaxy S7:Replacement phone for note 4:I believe the battery is the problem but they didn't send one.:2016-08-08:Drfish
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not to amusing:I bought this phone hoping it would be better but no its not:2016-08-07:Glopez76903
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not impressed so far:Had the phone for just over a week. Battery can't make it a full 12 hours. My music was not backed up by Verizon. Not really different than the S5 I had for 2 years.:2016-08-06:NJRick52
Samsung Galaxy S7:SO VERY DISAPPOINTED:I have never been more disappointed in a phone than I am with this one. Dropped calls (which have never been a problem), doesn't stay charged but for a short time, can't make calls from my residence (which is the reason I switched to Verizon to begin with) just overall very disappointed!!!!!!!!! And have only had it a little over a week  will be a very long 2 years waiting on next updrade!!!!!!:2016-08-06:Reeder64
Samsung Galaxy S7:HATE IT - ITS HORRIBLE AND I WISH I COULD THROW IT OUT:HATE IT - ITS TERRIBLE - I WANT MY OLD BLACKBERRY BACK.  I CAN'T GET VOICE MAIL SET UP AND I HAVE TO HIT FOUR BUTTONS TO EVEN GET TO MY HOME PAGE.  HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT:2016-08-04:DIE HARD BLACKBERRY FAN
Samsung Galaxy S7:Needs work:So far I'm not impressed.  I've had it a little over a week and the battery barely lasts the day and it keeps freezing.:2016-08-03:HBHBHBHB
Samsung Galaxy S7:Poor quality:It fell off a step on my patio (less than a foot) and cracked the screen. I've had a lot of phones drop a lot higher in the past and never cracked a screen before. Extremely disappointed with Samsung:2016-08-03:jrblock89
Samsung Galaxy S7:Junk Galaxy S7 phone:the phone is the biggest pile of garbage, GPS works off and on, battery life is horrible..the only saving grace is the camera...too bad i'm not a full time photographer and I actually need to use a phone for just that, making calls!:2016-08-02:
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy s7 - serious email issues:Seems like bugs haven't been worked out and the IMAP function is serious flawed:2016-08-02:ELLEN J
Samsung Galaxy S7:Junk battery:The phone is easy to set up and use. I enjoy the apps in the Google Play store much better than the Windows Phone store or the iPhone. However, I give a poor rating because the battery life is pathetic. It has a high mAh rating, but the battery does not last but about 75% of a work day with mild use. I've tried closing apps and doing other tricks for battery management, but those do not work. If I did not have a wireless charger at my desk my phone would never make it through the day. I wish I would have just gotten the iPhone even though I absolutely detest Apple. At least their products work.:2016-08-02:dbltap556
Samsung Galaxy S7:Must charge every day:I got this phone a week ago and I hate it:2016-08-02:Uilani
Samsung Galaxy S7:galaxy s7:I absolutely do not understand why the phone does not come in white....thats the only reason why i hesitate to buy this phone.:2016-08-02:pikachu1336
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone:I like the phone, but I don't like the interface. Yes, I know I can download apps. What I don't like is Verizon, Holly Molly they are expensive.:2016-08-02:Batman5520
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung Galaxy 7:so sorry I ever upgraded from Samsung 4. This started when someone ordered a new phone using my name, but it wasn't me and I had to report fraud. Then I did come in to Verizon to upgrade my phone due to broken screen. Since then it has been a DIASTER. the phone is possessed and auto regulates volume, changes programs without me touching the phone, will not auto connect to home wireless service. I have had to make 3 trips to a Verizon store to try to get the phone fixed and online 4 times.:2016-08-01:dp7504
Samsung Galaxy S7:Worst phone ever:I bought this 1 week ago and it barely stays charged, the back is also glass so it was broken on the second day, the wireless charger shuts itself off at 100% so when you pick it up for work in the morning it's down to 65%. 100 times the adds, adware, and incompatible programs as the SG 5, and the spellchecker is worse than the old one.:2016-08-01:Jaydog810
Samsung Galaxy S7:Buggy:Screen flashed on and off. Google play store didn't work. Had to reset phone. Going back to Note 5:2016-07-31:Macgyver1964
Samsung Galaxy S7:Don't like it at this time:I'm not liking it right now...maybe after I learn how to correctly use it I will feel differently. It's to sensitive, it's to difficult to operate. I can't believe how difficult it is to make a group list. I guess it's made for kids because my grandson can operate it better than me.:2016-07-31:Confusedalso
Samsung Galaxy S7:Returned my first one because of poor reception, 2nd one no better.:Had Samsung 5 for many years no problem, nothing but problems with Samsung 7:2016-07-30:Quilter52
Samsung Galaxy S7:transition is still happening:the settings change on their own:2016-07-29:avalos
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not a good transition from old cellhone.:My calendar did not transfer to my new phone.  My voice fades in and out so I have to go back to the Verizon store and get another one, which will take a long time.  My Words With Friends app did not transfer over so if I download the app again, I lose all current games and scores.  Many of my apps did not transfer over.:2016-07-28:djocompanion
Samsung Galaxy S7:Cannot download my 2400 iTunes:It has many good features EXCEPT download of iTunes has been impossible so far.  I'll keep trying but it shouldn't be that way.  Just too hard.  Need a workaround that works.:2016-07-28:Bob Lawson
Samsung Galaxy S7:Garbage:I bought this phone about a week ago and the battery has been junk since day 2 i have to.charge it at least twice a day from completely dead and the screen keeps freezing or doesn't respond like it should. Hate the phone:2016-07-28:Angry customer63140029
Samsung Galaxy S7:It's alright:Ok phone got talked into it since the store didn't really have anything else.:2016-07-27:Rhod
Samsung Galaxy S7:Slow and battery life is the worst:Not happy with the service and want out of my contract:2016-07-26:Bruce89
Samsung Galaxy S7:Stopped working  eight days after purchase.:Function keys non-responsive.:2016-07-26:Do not recall
Samsung Galaxy S7:Poor Battery life makes it useless:As configured by Verizon with no apps installed, I got 8 hours of a full charge on a moderate use day.  After turning off all the new features, installing my old apps, the battery life still can't match my previous 4 year old Droid Max.  Its at low battery at 12 hours on an average use day.   Inexcusable that a phone can't make it a full day with moderate use.  The design, performance and features are all irrelevant when you can't use them due to a poor battery.  I'm checking into the restocking fee and will return if its reasonable.:2016-07-25:daved750
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone:I've had it a week I wish I would have never sent my other one in:2016-07-25:Driver james
Samsung Galaxy S7:Good phone but not what it's cooked up to be:Good phone, but does not and cannot ever come up to the quality of the Motorola Droid Turbo 2. The Turbo 2 has a 21 megapixel camera. Plus, the battery is outstanding, and will last at least two days, sometimes more. If in standby, 3 days. That's unheard of. Samsung cannot compete.:2016-07-23:Kpowersd56
Samsung Galaxy S7:Massive data consumer:Upgraded to this phone and data usage has increased by approximately 50% in the same environment with no change in behavior.:2016-07-22:Mollye

Samsung Galaxy S7:Poor reception!:Black screen at 14 days of usage, replacement phone not much better, think it may be refurbished..:2016-07-20:Daniel480
Samsung Galaxy S7:Horrible:Upgraded to this phone on a Sunday and was back at the store the next 3 days with nothing but problems with it freezing..... Got another one did the same thing. Every 2 mins it go black freeze and shut off... So annoying!!  Switched back to my s5 till I can get a new phone in the morning. Hoping the edge is better!!!!:2016-07-20:Jaime1226
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great hardware, buggy software:"My moto x pure has never unexpectedly rebooted or gotten hot/laggy in the months I've had it. My S7 started doing that after 3 days, showing ""Process system isn't responding"" every time it started. Clearing the system cache didn't help, safe mode didn't help, and the error even came back after I did a factory reset and re installed all of my apps. None of this started until the last update from Verizon.":2016-07-18:Sashy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Too small:I don't like it at all... too small, no comparison to Note 5:2016-07-17:cacai
Samsung Galaxy S7:Continuous Drop Calls:2 phones, must be Worst phone ever, dropped calls continuously, voice fades in & out no matter where I am at. Austin TX I should not be getting dropped calls, no excuses.:2016-07-17:goose23
Samsung Galaxy S7:Thought this was going to be a good deal:Horrible service. Phone was more expensive than buying it at other stores and my bill is too much $:2016-07-13:Bgage29
Samsung Galaxy S7:Horrible battery life:I cannot even get few hours of talk time. The quick charger is the only way to use it and increase the battery level at the same time. Do not purchase this phone unless you want to be an AC outlet addict.:2016-07-13:
Samsung Galaxy S7:NO SERVICE:IVE HAD THIS PHONE FOR SEVEN DAYS. I WENT FROM SERVICE EVERYWHERE TO NO SERVICE 75% OF THE TIME. BATTERY LIFE IS ALSO HORRIBLE ON THE CHARGER MORNINGS & NITES. THE PHONE IS GOING BACK!!:2016-07-13:AL756
Samsung Galaxy S7:Miss my galaxy s5.:Had for a week, galaxy  s7, and hate it.  Battery dies so fast (my phone won't last a whole work day). Is so much smaller than my s5. Good note  is pictures are better.  But I seriously need to find a way for the battery to last.:2016-07-13:Smtaylor1997
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not happy:Who would make a phone out of tempered glass. I dropped my phone and now the back of it is shattered. I would never recommend this phone to anyone but if someone wants one I would tell them to buy an otter box right away because it will break if you drop it. Everyone has dropped their phones from time to time and I can't believe that they would make a phone this way.:2016-07-11:Madperson9876
Samsung Galaxy S7:my s5 was just as good. the battery also lasted longer.:wasted a lot of money for nothing.:2016-07-08:tooterjohn
Samsung Galaxy S7:Terrible phone! Better off with an older model!!:Not hardly the phone I expected it to be!!!:2016-07-08:DCE416
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone has been terrible:I bought the phone a couple of weeks ago and it is very slow. When I'm talking on the phone nobody can hear me. I'm very unhappy with the galaxy s7:2016-07-06:Mccluck
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung s7:Since buying phone I have had to have it replaced due to battery getting to hot . I have to restart almost daily in order to upload photos to facebook. Poor cell reception more place than not.:2016-07-05:Mary3813
Samsung Galaxy S7:Doesn't support Apps Well:Pandora stops randomly. Facebook doesn't work properly. Never had these issues with my S6 This is terrible.:2016-07-05:HHalcomb
Samsung Galaxy S7:Last samsung galaxy phone I get.:I'm constantly loosing service my phone calls always have a crackle sound to them. Volume sounds off and always low. The Settings never seem to stay set. I'd rather have my S4 back then this phone. In my opinion that was the best galaxy phone to date.:2016-07-04:Jrh878
Samsung Galaxy S7:I am very disappointed with my purchase of the Samsung S7:Phone is not compatible with my car ,do not like format of the phone, wish I bought an iPhone, did not know I only had 2 weeks to switch! Phone is still in great condition as I bought a case to protect it .If there is anything you can do to help me switch back to an Apple product please let me know. I miss my iPhone!:2016-07-04:Kcahalan01
Samsung Galaxy S7:Already quirky!:I've had this phone for 17 days.  It's my 3rd Samsung...maybe my 4th. It's already quirky.  The touch screen is either overly sensitive or delayed at recognizing touches, then rushes to catch up. I have a pattern lock on it and yesterday it wouldn't recognize the correct password pattern.  Other times when I unlock it random apps I haven't open are open on the screen.  2x now I've unlocked it and it automatically calls a random contact.  I will be going into my local store to see if they can help me.  I've heard great things about the 7 Edge. Stay away from the regular 7.:2016-07-03:CarlySFT
Samsung Galaxy S7:Non removable battery:If I was aware the S7 had a non removable battery (my S5 had a replaceable battery) I never would have bought it. This basically means that after two years this phone is garbage and if you dont want to charge it twice a day you will be shopping for a new one!:2016-07-03:JB01
Samsung Galaxy S7:Weak signal:I had better signal strength on my old first gen HTC One:2016-07-02:Bitterlizard
Samsung Galaxy S7:Screen is garbage:I have had this phone for four days and the screen cracked:2016-07-01:Yvonne88
Samsung Galaxy S7:Runs very slow:I bought this a week ago and already HATE it..... so slow can't never keep a charge onot it....:2016-06-30:Tanja potter
Samsung Galaxy S7:One Bar for 4G just doesn't cut it:I'm getting one bar on 4G and dropping calls...I'd recommend trying a different phone.:2016-06-30:Mocauth
Samsung Galaxy S7:I now I understand that phone popularity is 100% hype:First off, I bought this phone because it had expandable memory and it will get the latest Android software. However, the expandable storage is absolutely useless. Everytime I reset my phone or my phone dies, the SD card is corrupted. Because of this I lost a lot of pictures all my child's 2nd birthday.   I use the auxiliary cable and Bluetooth a lot due to the fact I travel for work.  This phone annoyingly decides what my volume should be at. I am 34 years old. I do not need someone to tell me how loud I want my volume. When you do go past the absolutely ridiculous warning, it seems to reset itself periodically. My phone is on my Dash in a Cell booster. So not only is it annoying it is also dangerous for me to fumble with the phone constantly to hear my work calls.  Needless to say that I will never be purchasing a Samsung again. I have been a loyal HTC customer sense the first Android operating system. I chose to go astray. A mistake I will not be repeating.:2016-06-30:Fizzel82
Samsung Galaxy S7:Phone drops calls more and sounds volume is so low I can barely hear it.:I upgraded from a flip phone and wish I had never done so, this phone drops more calls and the sound volume is so low I can barely hear it. Making a phone call and texting is such a pain I avoid it when possible. My old phone was a 2 button push from talkign to someone, this one is a menu search and jungle of buttons to find anything.:2016-06-28:Shawv
Samsung Galaxy S7:honestly, will probably return it and wait on the next Note:honestly, will probably return it and wait on the next Note:2016-06-27:krhyne
Samsung Galaxy S7:Overheating, Battery Eating Machine:Four days with this phone and I couldn't be more displeased.  I use the phone to make calls, text, and as an alarm.  I can't believe how hot it gets and how quickly the battery dies.  I asked my daughter to grab my phone off the table and it was too hot for her to touch.  That's unacceptable!! That said, I'm not happy at all with this purchase and I'll be in the store once again to get it taken care of.:2016-06-27:NadiaCMc
Samsung Galaxy S7:Review of Samsung Galaxy S7:"I do not like this phone because it isnt as easy to operate as my HTC Example: when copying text in a text message it doesnt allow you to select the text you want to copy its either all or nothing this is very annoying when someone tries to send you an address with more text than just the address in the text box, then when you go to copy it in google maps you have everything they said along with the address. This is not easy.":2016-06-27:tristian
Samsung Galaxy S7:Skip the S7 hype:This phone was purchased to replace a Droid Razor Maxx.  Which I had my old phone.  I'm returning the S7:2016-06-26:Apple dad
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointed:I only had the phone for 4 days and accidentally dropped it.  The screen shattered Instantly! Had my S4 for 2 years and never had a problem with it after it was dropped. Would not buy this phone again if given the choice. As for the rest of the questions, I didn't have the phone long enough to understand the new accessories.:2016-06-25:Robert0063
Samsung Galaxy S7:Poor reception and clumsy screen 'swipe.':I hate the phone and dread paying BIG $$$$$ for the next 2 years.:2016-06-22:GatorDave777
Samsung Galaxy S7:too many changes cannot make it work:I bought this phone two weeks ago and it is terrible!!!!  too big - too sensitive-too many changes.:2016-06-22:Billy Reid
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung 7:Not happy with this phone.  It drops calls all the time.  Lose service.  Not happy!:2016-06-21:Cchh
Samsung Galaxy S7:Very slow I hate it:Worst phone ever wish I would've kept my other phone:2016-06-20:Georgiamoocow
Samsung Galaxy S7:by far the worst pnone i have ever had:Have had this phone for a week, the charge on the battery may last 6 hours if you don't use it much. more than half the time when I get a call I can't here the person on the other end or they can't here me.:2016-06-19:tschmalriede
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not much difference between this and my S4:First off, I upgraded from an S4. I was expecting major improvements but the only thing that is better is the camera. The battery life is a joke. Not even doing anything and it goes low fast. The antenna is also not as good, as I have way more complaints about this phone than my S4.:2016-06-18:richhthe3rd
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery is terrible, barely dropped hit edge of desk shatterd the back GLASS:Total garbage. Worst phone ever Battery has to charge 2 times a day, Note I do not play games or use many apps. The back of the phone has a glass cover. GLASS not metal.. FRAGILE. This broke on day number 4 of owning it from a very small drop to my desk. I purchased a expensive screen protector from the brick and mortar store that sells this had it installed it is not the right size makes it look terrible. I can not return it from the crack in the glass or I would have been back. STAY AWAY.:2016-06-17:kizin71
Samsung Galaxy S7:CHEAPEST, MOST EXPENSIVE PHONE I'VE EVER OWNED.:I had this phone less than 2 weeks, with a case, with a glass screen protector on it (verizon had NO lifeproof cases)  the screen now has several dents in it, cracks; the quality of the construction is horrible.  Its only 2 months old.  I can't imagine that it's going to last 2 years.  it's fragile. I bought it so that it could withstand water and to replace the note 4 that got water logged but given how much it does not handle dry land, i have no hopes that it will withstand water as it claims.    basically, if you don't take it outside, keep the phone inside of a bubble, don't press to hard on it, never drop it, don't touch the screen with anything, or use it too much, then it's a fine phone.  Other than that -- buy something more durable - if you actually want to use it & have it last for 2 years.  VERY DISAPPOINTED in this purchase.:2016-06-17:RTiger
Samsung Galaxy S7:Third day out:Got locked out of my own phone on 2nd day but by no fault of mine. Have to send back to factory on 3rd day.:2016-06-17:Larry G
Samsung Galaxy S7:Do not like:This phone is not user friendly at all, emails don't so images unless I load more and then I have to click show images, to see them. To return a missed call I have to touch 3 commands before the call is made, I was text an address today and had to copy & paste it to maps before it would show location. When sending text I type the 1st letter of the name of the person and get a list of every name in my contact list that has that letter in any part of it, not the names that begin with that 1 letter. The font in maps is to small especially interstate & highways no matter how much you zoom in, those never get any bigger. I could go on and on, glad I have an 13 day trial period, it's going back tomorrow.:2016-06-17:Dyountz68
Samsung Galaxy S7:NOBODY CAN HEAR ME WHEN THEY CALL:Nobody can even understand or hear me when they call. never had that with my S4.  Phone freezes up and drops calls alot.:2016-06-15:onebleueye
Samsung Galaxy S7:Old Software and Inefficient Design:I dislike this phone- the Folders WHY?  the inability to HIDE Preinstalled Apps WHY?:2016-06-14:prdrj
Samsung Galaxy S7:Doesn't  come in:Had this for 13 days hate it:2016-06-14:Mebriggs62
Samsung Galaxy S7:Bad service:Had the galaxy s5,service was great.  Upgraded to the s7,drop calls everywhere I go.:2016-06-12:Thatdude504
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not that great:I  miss a lot of the features the galaxy 5 had. But some body decided to remove the features that made the galaxy easy and convenient. Disappointed camera has not improved. To mute phone is more difficult.  Should have tried note 5? Can no adjust touch sensitivity.:2016-06-12:Pcraft29
Samsung Galaxy S7:Keeps dropping calls problem with similar card on both phones:I can not rate this phone problem with both phones simple cards keeps dropping a lot of our calls:2016-06-12:Kiarahernandez
Samsung Galaxy S7:Samsung 7:Hate the new Galaxy7 and the android os.:2016-06-10:Stupid galaxy
Samsung Galaxy S7:Wastes a TON of data!:My data usage skyrocketed and I had to do a lot of research to figure out why.  I also had to shut off a lot of features, notifications, etc, etc.   In only a few days, nearly half my data was used up.  Normally, with my S5, it took all month to even get close to using it up.  Some features are more hidden.  I HATE that I have to push a side button to take a picture instead of just tapping the screen.   Would like the phone to be larger as well.  Google interface is changed and less user friendly - data hog.:2016-06-10:xraykayc
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone and service:The sales person was so good and knowledgeable. Took no time at all to get hooked up and started with my new phone.:2016-06-09:blenism5998
Samsung Galaxy S7:Suppose to be an upgrade but seems more like a downgrade from my note 3:Dropped calls, bad reception & loses GPS signal a lot.  Didn't have any of these problems with my galaxy note 3.  Phone is useless if I can't have a phone call in peace:2016-06-07:TeamO
Samsung Galaxy S7:Does not work well in rural areas.  Messaging does not work.  Do not buy.:The phone does not have the ability to keep messages in cue for sending or receiving unlike the I-phones.  It does not work well in weak signal areas or transitioning between 1X and other service areas especially non-Verizon areas.:2016-06-07:Tennesseerader
Samsung Galaxy S7:Unreliable phone drops calls:I bought it May 3. Since then, I'very had so many dropped calls, the Verizon store replaced the SIM.CARD and told me to give it a try. That was nearly 2 weeks ago. Since then, the phone has dropped 7 calls. I am disgusted!:2016-06-06:GrandmomTigger
Samsung Galaxy S7:Terrible:Broke it in 4 days.  Can't withstand a 1 foot fall.  You'd think something that costs this much would be at least a little durable.  Until you put an aftermarket case on it,  it's basically like carrying an egg around:2016-06-01:1qaz2wsx3edc4rfv
Samsung Galaxy S7:Terrible reception where I live.:I bought the new S7 about ten days ago and I am regretting it. Everyone else in my house has iPhones and they have great reception. I do not.:2016-06-01:Dannnnn
Samsung Galaxy S7:Terrible:Honestly if I could rate this lower than a 1 star I would. I personally do not like this phone. It completely freezes whenever someone texts me and I'm trying to respond to them. Its always dropping calls or losing some type of connection. I'm constantly having to manually restart it for it to even work properly, on several occasions I haven't gotten any calls or texts the only thing that worked was my Facebook messenger for some reason. The battery life is also bad for me even with power saver mode on. I've taken pictures and they haven't even saved on my phone which is extremely annoying.  I personally don't care for this phone. It has been nothing but bad for me. Will definitely be switching back to a Motorola phone. Extremely disappointed:2016-06-01:HollywoodRWH
Samsung Galaxy S7:Lame:Will not charge for hours after dying.:2016-05-31:HollsKay
Samsung Galaxy S7:Slow playing videos:I bought this a month ago and I regret trading in my galaxy s5 for the s7:2016-05-31:Squeak38
Samsung Galaxy S7:Terrible reception, drops calls. S5 was so much better:I was so excited to upgrade to the S7...until I got it, and I have virtually NO reception anywhere I go.  I had exchanged the first phone within the first 2 weeks because it kept dropping calls, or just flat out not receiving them, so I was told the device was faulty.  After getting the second one, I have the same issue.  I am going to the store today to try to exchange this for something else. I cannot have a phone that is unable to receive calls at my home, or at my work.   I work directly across the road from a verizon tower, yet my reception is 1 bar at best. If a call does come in, the person on the other end cannot hear me and then the call drops.  The data connection is just as bad. The only thing this phone does properly is send texts.  I'm not sure why they would make this phone with such a horrible antenna. My S5 worked fine everywhere, and never once dropped a call.:2016-05-31:grain190
Samsung Galaxy S7:Horrible reception:So disappointed with phone reception, also drops calls:2016-05-30:Tabuick
Samsung Galaxy S7:Battery life kills this phone - Stay away:I've been using this phone for a few months (mind you I also needed a replacement because my first S7 had re-boot issues). Yes, overall it's good phone (when you have one that works). The problem with it is the battery. I have been having to constantly plug it in through out the day, and I barely use the phone enough to demand this. I stay on top of closing my apps after using them, and try to keep brightness down. When I look at my battery statistics, the two biggest drainers are usually Android System and Android OS.   If you're looking for a slim pretty phone with no ability to even swap out the weak battery, this is your best bet. Also, what's the point of putting a beautiful screen on a phone if you have to keep it at 10% screen brightness the whole time? I'll be switching to a Droid Turbo because I actually want to use my phone.:2016-05-30:BM916
Samsung Galaxy S7:Same ol Samsung phone, not very many new great gators:I bought this phone about a month ago, upgrading from a 2 year old note 3, and the new features that are supposed to be all the rave are nothing to write home about, and the battery life is less than deplorable! I have to charge my phone at least once during the day if I barely use it, but usually it needs constant attention, any time I'm around a charger:2016-05-30:Jay spen
Samsung Galaxy S7:Trouble with it since day one!:Second day it would not send or receive text message! Took over an hour with tech support to fix it! Always disconnecting from my WiFi!:2016-05-29:Nobody35

Samsung Galaxy S7:It freeze on me:And when I try to type  it freeze:2016-05-28:Hortencia
Samsung Galaxy S7:I'm very frustrated with it:I can't even name all the things I'm having trouble with for this phone! Sometimes it won't save my contacts, it keeps freezing/ it turns the screen off at random times, it's slow, I lost so many things that I could do with my iphone. There are so many reasons why I am frustrated with this phone but I am NOT happy with it at all! It's a cool phone and it's pretty and takes good pictures, etc., however I am so frustrated with it! I miss my iphone! I could of had a much cheaper replacement through our insurance to the new iPhone but was told how great this phone it and it is awful!:2016-05-26:Katie swimmer17200
Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy to use, Easy to Customize, Great Camera, Great Features:So easy to use. Love all the options for customizing. Camera has nice features.  Really enjoying it so far.:2016-05-23:carolv57
Samsung Galaxy S7:very slow-glaaxy note 3 much faster:I bought this a week ago and am thinking of returning it:2016-05-22:lolalola3
Samsung Galaxy S7:This Phone Has So Many Bug Problems:This phone is a piece of junk. Plain and simple. At least 2 times an hour the phone randomly reboots, and sometimes I need to manually reboot it. Apps will freeze and the phone will restart, apps will just close, it is very frustrating. Do not buy this phone. I wish I bought an iPhone.:2016-05-21:mets2016
Samsung Galaxy S7:Bubble:Not that great for the price:2016-05-20:Bubble 123r
Samsung Galaxy S7:Galaxy s7:I got my Galaxy S7 as soon as it came out. And now I'm on my second one about to get a third. The reception is terrible. I can't be on the phone and on line at the same time because I get an error message that says the apps can't be used while on the phone. The galaxy s5 was a way better phone. With way better reception. I'm going to give them one more chance to fix the issues. If there can't fix it I might see if the have a s5 in Stock.:2016-05-19:S7 Hater
Samsung Galaxy S7:Ok:Like my s5 better screen doesn't work with gloves on or can't change sensitivity of it:2016-05-19:Athomas2636
Samsung Galaxy S7:Have had nothing but issues:I purchased this phone and had to exchange it 2 times. I am sooooo disappointed with this phone. It makes no sense for us to pay so much for a phone and service and it doesn't work as intended.:2016-05-19:Rattatouie
Samsung Galaxy S7:Much too large and difficult to operate:This phone is too large to stay in my pocket.  It does not work like my previous Samsung Galaxy phone. (S4)  I do like that it did not come with a lot of useless apps pre loaded.:2016-05-18:ali127
Samsung Galaxy S7:Frustrated:S7 suppose to be the newest and greatest ... don't bother to buy this junk:2016-05-16:IgotrobS7
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disgusting produt:I bought this phone 4 days ago and am already disgusted with it. It is slower than my S3 when you try to open it, all screens are slow to load, I haven't found where I can add attachments to text messages....the list goes on and on.  I asm seriously considering returning this phone and canceling my Verizon service before the 14 days are up.:2016-05-16:Picked_a_Name_at_Random
Samsung Galaxy S7:Poor performance for what you pay for.:Upgraded from 5 to 7. Slow speed, poor memory and constant crashing to new a few problems.:2016-05-16:ericse1984
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not as good as I expected:I got this phone a week ago and have had problems already with it not working right. Most of the time it won't let me refresh my Facebook account so I can see new posts. It tells me to check my internet settings so I have to restart the phone for it to work from the app but i works perfectly through google. I took it in and the lady checked the settings and said they were good. She uninstalled the FB app and reinstalled it and told me to try it for a bit but it did it again when I tried a couple hours later. I hope to be able to get a new phone and not an insurance one as they are worse!:2016-05-16:cmrgrr
Samsung Galaxy S7:The phone is great but I'll never go to the Eagan Verizon store again:Phone works. What can I say? Version didn't build it:2016-05-14:Mnmike130
Samsung Galaxy S7:nothing transferred correctly, many items lost and phone not syncing with other apps:nothing transferred correctly, many items lost and phone not syncing with other apps:2016-05-13:ktner
Samsung Galaxy S7:Completely unreliable, pathetic battery life:"Wrote a nice, detailed review but the ""screener"" said mentioning a competitor was ""profanity"",so here's the short verison:  Battery is utter garbage and won't hold a charge longer than five hours. Missed calls for work (bad) and had to explain to a supervisor (sounds like an excuse). Don't download new software if prompted...phone was fine before that.":2016-05-12:oneloneclone
Samsung Galaxy S7:Sensorless:S7 dropped temperature, humidity, and infra red sensors. Sad given s4 senor rich model.:2016-05-09:s4supporter
Samsung Galaxy S7:Don't buy it:Horrible battery life, wifi keeps disconnecting:2016-05-07:Someone25
Samsung Galaxy S7:GS7:Battery takes to long to charge for the length of use. And the phone is fragile it cracks very easy.:2016-05-04:Jgn44
Samsung Galaxy S7:Don't do it, stay with an Iphone:I bought this Samsung S7 because I always heard how good Samsung was - NOT. When I backed up my old IPhone in preparation for switching, it took 65 minutes. I have had to restart twice on the new Samsung and it is telling me it will take 1 day, 4 hours to download the data, and that didn't include any of the apps. I have tried to download 6 of my old apps, but only 2 have downloaded. The phone is telling me that it can't download the others. When I try to go to Verizon cloud, it tells me that I don't have internet access, yet it is connected to my WI-FI and everything else works, (browser, mail, weather, etc). My email, when I hit mail icon, tells me it can't connect with the server, yet when I go under the gmail icon, there is my mail (and yes, I have verified that the settings are correct. My wife sent me several pictures by text message, still waiting for that to come through (have them all on my iPad though). I tried to send her some pictures, forget about it. Battery life is abysmal. I went from a full charge to 84% in 45 minutes this morning just trying to look at features. I think this is going to be returned tomorrow, have to check out my options.:2016-05-01:no1uwouldno
Samsung Galaxy S7:Too big.:It's so bid it doesn't fit the hand well unless you are a giant! It's like talking on a tablet!:2016-04-26:juddstr
Samsung Galaxy S7:What a joke:Bought the phone a month ago. The battery is at 20% after work even when I'm not using it all day, randomly gets burning hot. And finally I got water on it yesterday and the charge plug no longer works. Submerged for less than 5 seconds. Last phone was a Sony loved the waterproof and battery life.:2016-04-26:UniversalChip
Samsung Galaxy S7:Poor Battrey life:Very disappointed. I can see the battery life indicator drop before my eyes. Tried to get rid of as many apps as possible to see if that would help drainage. No luck. I had an S3 and S4 with same apps and they did not need to be charged this much in order to work. Not worth the money. Taking it back after only a few days from purchase.:2016-04-25:Teeney51
Samsung Galaxy S7:Extremely Disappointed:I was excited to get back to a Samsung. I've had nothing BUT Samsungs since the S3 until the S6. I would NOT be without a microSD card and was hesitant about no removable battery. I went with a LG G4. However, when they came out with the 7, I got an Edge for me and a standard 7 for my wife. If the screen were bigger, I would've gone with the standard 7. I do NOT like the edge. It is too hard to hit keys that are right at the edge. Sometimes you have to hit it several times. Also, the speaker is terrible. If the phone is in my holster, I can hardly hear it ring. I also don't like the glass back. The second day we had the phones, my wife's phone slipped off the couch and the back broke! Come on, Samsung, you can do better.:2016-04-24:rarert
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not what ads claimso:Very confusing to use. Only has Mirror screen for car application, not smart tv, have to download other apps that don't work the same as the S4 version. Have to hookup via wi-fi, which eats data very quickly causing additional fees. It auto responds to people texting me while driving and also post response on Facebook Facebook does not need to know my business. It's nothing more than a high grade camera that fails as a phone:2016-04-24:dababka
Samsung Galaxy S7:Lousy battery:I have a galaxy s5 and can get as much as two days on a charge and I am on the phone constantly. It is my work phone. So decided to get the new S7 as my personal phone. This phone is used very little during the day. Full charge a 7am when I unplug it. Down to 50%by noon with no calls and only checking email....mostly deleting junk which takes no time. By dinner it is around 40%. A few texts and three games of trivia crack had the charge below 20% by 11pm last night.  The performance is just unacceptable. So buy it if you can keep it charging all day. But this purchase was a mistake.:2016-04-23:Speckles and Sam
Samsung Galaxy S7:Data Hog:Previous phone a Galaxy 3 and loved it! This thing is a data hog. Rarely went over my Gigabytes and now with 19 days left on my cycle looking at going over my data in the next 2 days! I do the EXACT same things I did before. Used 3.2 GB in one day on email alone - NO DOWNLOADS! Something is seriously wrong with this phone!:2016-04-18:adoyle1111
Samsung Galaxy S7:very dissapointed:I bought this phone last month. It's the worst phone ever, it's very slippery, it advertise to have a long lasting batter, after a couple of calls ,and a few text massages and don't dare check your email!:2016-04-14:MISS MY LG
Samsung Galaxy S7:terrible cell reception:I went through 2 of these phones thinking the first one may have been bad or something. A phone should be able to be used as a phone. Very poor reception, dropped calls etc etc.:2016-04-11:lmic15
Samsung Galaxy S7:no cell coverage at my house:I bought two of these phones last week. I'm taking both back this afternoon. I can't make a call, I can't learn to use it since there is no cell service. My LG worked for years without dripping one call. Nice worthless upgrade.:2016-04-11:moakie
Samsung Galaxy S7:Awful, Not what i expected:"Bought this less than a week and there is a black spot on my camera, it is not dust. The circle is like a black smear and goes off and on. Since the ""phantom"" circle only appears when it wants, the retailer wont let me replace it because he needs ""hard"" evidence. This defect seems to be shy once i step into a Verizon store. Waterproof ? , so far it is fair. I have to play music loud for the water can get out of the speaker and once again it can sound ""ok"". Dissapointed that the Tempered glass doesnt cover the full screen of the Samsung s7, ...oh, and it heats up in 1 hour, but my girlfriend's phones, she can use it all day and it is cool. So far, i am dissapointed with this purchase, specially being new to Verizon":2016-04-11:marchdz96
Samsung Galaxy S7:Restarts constantly.:I bought the S7 one week ago. I am now on my 2nd one due to the phone randomly restarting. 2nd phone with same issue. Awful. If you don't mind the phone restarting 15 to 20 times a day then this is a grand phone.:2016-04-09:pumpkinpi
Samsung Galaxy S7:Disappointment:If you like having Bluetooth, WiFi, and having a phone that doesn't randomly freeze and restart, then don't buy this phone. I've had the phone for 3 weeks and now I can't connect/find any WiFi or Bluetooth connections. The phone will also randomly freeze and reboot itself. It's too late to return it, so it looks like I'm gonna have a useless phone till a software update comes out.:2016-04-09:Nathan05
Samsung Galaxy S7:Hype:Phone is OK battery dose not last.and phone service is terrible realy hard to make calls.not worth the money it's all hype:2016-04-07:Henrytz
Samsung Galaxy S7:"Only had the phone for 12 days before it died :(":I was looking forward to upgrading to a Galaxy s7 after owning many Galaxy phones in the past. To name a few; Galaxy s3, Galaxy s3 mini, Galaxy Note 3 etc.. 12 days after purchasing the phone I went to make a phone call to my mom. When her voicemail picked up, I pulled the phone from my ear and the screen didn't illuminate. So, I pressed the power button and the screen stayed black. So I pressed the button on the bottom of the phone and this time the soft keys illuminated, but not the screen..it remained black. I brought it to a Verizon store so they could confirm my belief and unfortunately, they did. The digitizer went bad. I believe this was due to an overheating issue as the phone had been pretty hot (with no use and no running apps). Overheating is not the only issue I experienced... Keyboard lag, camera lag when zoomed in, freezing and the unremovable battery. I couldn't hang up my phone because I couldn't remove the battery.:2016-04-06:Nicsey
Samsung Galaxy S7:Not too happy about the Galaxy S7:I just received this phone last Wednesday, and today while I was on the phone having a conversation the phone went completely black.:2016-04-04:chrisashallari37

Samsung Galaxy S7:Easy transition from my old phone:Coming form a Samsung Galaxy S4 it was an easy transition to the S7.  The camera is exceptional and the other functions are easily used and similar to the S4.  The only con that I have is the curved surface and slim design make it very hard to securely hold the phone.  I definitely recommend getting a protective case for it.:2017-04-06:Gmatt

Samsung Galaxy S7:Camera:This phone has a very high quality camera for a mobile device. Naturally, it does not replace a device created solely for picture taking; however, its camera produces high resolution photographs for both everyday use and, to a rather high degree, a more expansive range of photography.:2017-04-05:fralando
Samsung Galaxy S7:Great phone so far!:I love my new Galaxy S7 so far. I had the Galaxy S5 before and I love this phone so much more! The content transfer from one phone to the other was super easy and so far everything has been working great!:2017-04-05:Newcustomer222

Samsung Galaxy S7:Upgrade to a new Samsug S7:The Galaxy 7 has proven to be an easy upgrade from my Samsug S5.  The data transfer went well.  Tech support has been a added benefit that has help me make the transition and learn where and how to find the settings and apps I needed.  The battery gets quite hot at times of heave usage but neve to hot to hold my phone.:2017-04-03:Tleno
